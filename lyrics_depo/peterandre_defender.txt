I’ll be your defender.
I’ll be your defender.

When the days are dark,
And the nights are only getting longer
When you’ve lost your heart,
And it seems the opposition is getting stronger

If ever you cry,
And the enemy calls you name.

I’ll never leave your side.

I Know you’ve met a lot of guys with super egos,
But I’m going to save your heart like a super hero.

Never leave your side, I’ll be here to protect you.
They can say what they want, they can all surround me,
But I’m gonna save your front(from?) like a military army.

I’m here for you, I’ll be your defender.

Baby don’t sleep on me,
Let me give you everything that you need. (oh wooah)

Your under attack and it seems your tired of fighting
The memories of your past
Keep you scared of love and hiding
Don’t push me away
Because I need cause I never ever tried to harm ya
And I’m gonna fight a battle my way there
Like a knight in shining armor
