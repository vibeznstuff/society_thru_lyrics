I can't fall down on my knees
(I thought you loved me)
And apologise to you
(If you really loved me you would of stayed with me)
(And apologised to me that's all i asked for)
Cause that ain't my style
(Well let me hear what you had to say earlier)


I remember how we met it was on the train
How could i forget you smiled and looked at me
The soft of your lips, they captured me
The whole ride down we kept our eyes on each other
And then we sat, down together
You gave me your number, said give me a call
I thought i wouldn't call at all
Here we are fell in love like hand to glove
Pure bliss from above
Now all we seem to do is fuss and fight
We never seem to get it right
See there's too much fire so much desire
So it took a little time to take me higher
I'm sorry if i hurt you and i went astray
I guess we gotta call it a day
Ha heh


I can't fall down on my knees
(on my knees)
And apologise to you
(to you)
Cause that ain't my style
(That ain't my style)


I remember one night when we were home alone
You were on the sofa i was on the phone
You overheard me call out my best friends name
That's when u went crazy started going insane
Grabbed the phone from my hand
Backed me against the wall
Shouting and asking who was on the call
You wouldn't believe me when i said it's just a friend
That's when all the madness began
You kept yelling wild I fell to the floor
Crying these tears, I couldn't cry them no more
I knew you had a temper
I wish i didn't see it
You wanted me to be faithful
I told you i could be it
But that didn't stop you from putting your hands on my face
You simply said you had to put me in my place
At the end of every tunnel there's always a light
And the door.. it sure looks right

That's why-hy-hy-hy-hy



He's got you begging on your knees
Crying in your sleep
Making you believe him
But you're stronger
Than you'll ever know girl
You control your own world
No need to take no more 


Yo, Heh yo I asked you to calm down
Asked you who was on the phone put the horn down
You had a glass of wine a Versace night gown, a lime green one
That i bought you for your trip from the cruise you won
I don't wanna fool with those male friends
I told you back then when we first got together
I don't trust those men
And you did it again
I lost my temper laid down and wrecked the house boo
That's all i can remember, I'm sorry




I can't fall down on my knees
And apologise to you
Cause that ain't my style
