No one ever loved you more
And you're all I'm living for
Now I'm screaming silently
It's so hard to believe
You're not in love with me

Baby there's no easy way to hear the words
I'm sorry I don't love you
You tried to leave me once before
But felt so bad you let me love you more

Baby there's no gentle way
No tender sentimental way
To leave me
You offered me your sympathy
But I'm as lonely as can be
Sorry doesn't always make it right

No one ever loved you so
While you were trying to go
I guess I didn't know

Baby there's no easy way to hear the words
I'm sorry I don't love you
You hurt me then apologized
You better go before i lose my pride

Baby there's no gentle way
No tender sentimental way
To leave me
I wish that I could make you care
But all in love just isn't fair
But sorry doesn't always make it right

Now it's time for you to leave
It's so hard to believe
You're not in love with me
