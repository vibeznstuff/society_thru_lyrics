Never tell a lie, tonight you couldn't find a better guy

G5 waitin, fly away at my convenience

with some 5-star freaks, gettin high all week (Let's GO!!!!)
Catch me in the week, I was up all night when y'all sleep
in a fast car, superbad broads, back seat
That's me, see I'm nothin nice, fuck a couple nights
With the moon say goodbye and the sun greetin us like...
