Flowers, they don't always bloom
And even when they do they're not meant to last forever
Love can turn out any time
The good and bad, the wrong and right
Find a way to come together
'Cause I've got you to pull me through another day
And you've got me together we will run away
'Cause I've got you, whocares what anyone may say
I know I'm gonna find my way, 'cause I found you
I found you
They say that we're too young
Too young we've just begun
To realise what we've been given
Take our chances as they come
Don't look back at what's been done
Pass the road that we have driven
'Cause I've got you to pull me through another day
And you've got me together we will run away
'Cause I've got you, who cares what anyone may say
I know I'm gonna find my way, 'cause I found you (you)
Found you
Found you
If I have you I've got everything
If I've got you I've got the moon, the stars, the sun
What more could I want?
What more could I want?
'Cause I've got you to pull me through another day
And you've got me together we will run away
'Cause I've got you, who cares what anyone may say
I know I'm gonna find my way, 'cause I found you (you)
I found you
You
Found you
