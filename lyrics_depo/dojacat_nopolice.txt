Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh, whee-ooh

They say I bang
They never toy with me
Royal from the crown to my fucking feet
They say talk that talk
Walk but please avoid the streets
Lock the jar, lock the door
Avoid the speech
Cos once you speak
Bullshit reek like oil leak
Pop a pill, cop a feel
Rock the least

How the fuck you do that in them denim jeans?
All these bars, no police

Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh
All these bars, no police

Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh (pop a zany - free)
All these bars, no police

He calls me copper tone
Smoking ultraviolet
We turn off the phone
I'm in autopilot
Make that disappear
Mr. Copperfield
When we write he bust them tricks
I lean and pop a wheel
Watching brandy sipping brandy
Panties on the marble floor
Guess my pants is fancy
Bitches acting catty on the set
Make your man tap me on his neck
Or tap me on your back
Mmm, that's nasty but I'm classy with this shit
So pop a couple xanies for me quick

Pop a couple xanies for me quick
Pop a couple xanies for me bitch

Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh
All these bars, no police

Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh (pop a zany - free)
All these bars, no police

Yellow bars did again
Somehow this shit medicine
Feel that slow high setting in
It'll take you to a place you ain't never been
Like floating on cotton candy clouds
Shirt and panties on the ground
This kitties' hot, fan it down
Make moves on me, papi, don't stand around
One for you, one for me, want me to break you half?
Your gentle touch on my naked ass
?these something nice when that AC blast
Them bars put easy a crazy pass so?

Baby if you need it come and get it
Just can't hold this back from you

Now pop this with me
