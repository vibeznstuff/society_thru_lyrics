Congratulations 
And celebrations
When I tell everyone that you're in love
With me
Congratulations
And jubilations
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be.

Who could believe that I could be happy and contented
I used to think that happiness hadn't been invented
But that was in the bad old days before I met you
When I let you walk into my heart

Congratulations

With me
Congratulations

I was afraid that maybe you thought you were above me
That I was only fooling myself to think you loved me
But then tonight you said you couldn't live without me
That round about me 
You wanted to stay
