Collision Course, you're set in motion 
There can be no turning away 
The force of will in this inertia 
An inner strength you can't explain 
Preparation for the impact 
Tell yourself don't be afraid 
Remind yourself that all emotion began with an explosion 
Therein lies the origin of everything 

They tried to infiltrate you 
Tried to get inside your head 
Sense of something watching over you 
Like a spider in it's web 
I burnt the letters that you sent me 
God I miss my old friends 
But every state is not permanent 
Yes the truth is evident 
Nothing lasts forever 
Make the difference 

I'm ready to break the hold of oppression keeping down my soul 
We're in this together 
I need you close 
You're not in this alone 
Fall down on my knees 
Three years under siege 
I pray for deliverance 
Black clouds hanging low 
So heavy with snow 
The storm it is imminent 

All calm on the surface 
Not time to break the silence 
Breeze rippling the water 
Snow falling in a courtyard 
The tension of quiet moments 
Zero hour approaching 
Feel the build 
Anticipation 
I'm standing at a border 
The future has no shape or form 
Can't turn back 
Stay on course 
Stay on course 

I'm ready to break the hold of oppression keeping down my soul 
We're in this together 
I need you close 
You're not in this alone 
Fall down on my knees 
Three years under siege 
I pray for deliverance 
Black clouds hanging low 
So heavy with snow 
The storm it is imminent 

The music of the spheres 
The music of the spheres 
The Shattered idea 
You're at the frontier 
The Shattered idea 
The vision is clear 
The feelings of fear 
The vision appears 
The music of the spheres 
The feelings I fear 
The falling of tears 
The shattered idea 
You're trying to get clear 
The entrance is near 
You're at the frontier 
The shadows you fear 
The message is clear 
The entrance appears 
The broken idea 
The passing of years 
The music of the spheres 
The music of the spheres 
The falling of tears 
The falling of tears 
You're at the frontier 
The message is clear 
You're at the frontier 
You're at the frontier 
The falling of tears 
The music of the spheres 
You're trying to get clear 
The broken ideas 
You're at the frontier 
You're at the frontier 
The passing of years 
The entrance of fear 
The grinding of gears 
The garden of tears 
The feelings of fear 
The feelings I fear 
The vision is clear 
You're trying to get clear 
The shattered idea 
The broken idea 
The shadows you fear 
The falling of tears 
The feelings I fear 
You're at the frontier 
The garden of tears 
The music of the spheres 
The grinding of gears 
The vision of fear 
The entrance appears 
The music of the spheres 
The music of the spheres 
The music of the spheres
