(And now the Waltz)
He will never be free
Yeah, he'll always want you
He'll always need you

We lay there, your long hair was warm
The last night together, we made love until dawn
My nights on the town made you cry
Let's make love one more time, before I say goodbye


C'est la vie
Ooh cherie
C'est la vie
Another time - another place - ooh
We'll be together again - you never leave me, baby
Another time - another place -ooh
We'll start all over again

We talked of the fun, oh, we'd had
Remember the good times - we remembered the bad
My two timing ways made you low
Let's make love one more time before I have to go


C'est la vie
Ooh cherie
C'est la vie
He will never be free - never never
Yeah, he'll always want you - I'll always want you
He'll always need you - I'll always need you
Another time - another place - ooh
We'll be together again - yeah

Another time - another place
We'll start all over again
C'est la vie
Ooh cherie
C'est la vie
Ooh cherie
C'est la vieeeeah!
He will never be free - he'll never can
Yeah, he'll always want you - I'll always want you
He'll always need you - I'll always need you
He'll always need you - I'll always want you - wouwouwouwou!
