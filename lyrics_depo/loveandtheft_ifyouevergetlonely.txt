Thanks for calling
It's so good to hear your voice
But you keep breaking up
In all the static and the noise
But I keep listening
'Cause I never had a choice when it came to you

I'd love to see you
If you're ever out this way
You sound happy
Guess things are working out okay
And I'm getting better
At putting one foot in front of the other

And I know that California ain't to blame
And I know there's a tons of people in LA

But if you ever get lonely
And you miss me
If you need someone to listen
Even if it's only
The sound of someone's voice who loves you
That you need to hear
You know where to find me
If you ever get lonely

Sounds like a good time
Going down at the other end
You got a new love, got a new life
A whole new set of friends
But are you listenin'
Do you expect me to pretend that I don't love you
I don't love you

But if you ever get lonely
And you miss me
If you need someone to listen
Even if it's only
The sound of someone's voice who loves you
That you need to hear
You know where to find me
If you ever get lonely

Were you ever really listening?
Were you ever really there?

But if you ever get lonely
And you miss me
If you need someone to listen
Even if it's only
The sound of someone's voice who loves you
That you need to hear
You know where to find me
If you ever get lonely
If you ever get lonely
