oh heartbeat city
here we come
well happy days
we count on thumbs
and nothing really
gets us down
as long as jacki's
back in town

i'm glad you made it
i can't complain
i missed you badly
when you jumped that train

oh jacki
what took you so long
on just a holiday
oh jacki
what took you so long
i thought you knew the way
i thought you blew away

oh heartbeat city
never stops
and all you need
is what you got
and there's a place
for everyone
under heartbeat city's
golden sun

oh heartbeat city
lights at night
keeps getting closer
out of sight
oh heartbeat city's
on the loose
better catch
the blue caboose
