Captured my heart, captured my memory
Captured a time for me, I could see
A time for me was gonna be
Deep in my heart, deep in my memory
Deep in a part of me, heart of me
Meant to be history
Could it be that I'm still wondering

I never knew what had happened to me
I didn't think it was true
That I could be just like anyone else
I'll take my chance with you

Picture a dream, picture a fantasy
Picture the mood of me, mystery
You and me, a mystery
Lost in a dream, lost in a fantasy
Lost in what seemed to be dreams to me
Seemed to be, had to be
Couldn't find no other reason

I never knew what had happened to me
I didn't think it was true
That I could be just like anyone else
I'll take my chance with you

Let's have a drink, it's Marguerita time
It's Marguerita time, after nine
Summertime, anytime
You'll still always find me wondering

I never knew what had happened to me
I didn't think it was true
That I could be just like anyone else
I'll take my chance with you
