Ooh, watching me... 
Hanging by a string this time 
Don't, easily... 
The climax of the perfect lie 
Ooh, watching me... 
Hanging by a string this time 
Don't, easily... 
Smile worth a hundred lies 

If there's lessons to be learned
I'd rather get my jamming words in first, so 
Tell you something that I've found
That the world's a better place 
When it's upside down, boy

If there's lessons to be learned,
I'd rather get my jamming words in first, so 
When you're playing with desire
Don't come running to my place when it burns like fire, boy 

Sweet about me 
Nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me 
Nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me 
Nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me 
Nothing sweet about me, yeah

Blue, blue, blue 
Waves, they crash 
As time goes by 
So hard to catch 
Too, too smooth 
Ain't all that 
Why don't you ride 
On my side 
Of the tracks 

If there's lessons to be learned
I'd rather get my jamming words in first, so 
Tell you something that I've found
That the world's a better place 
When it's upside down, boy

If there's lessons to be learned
I'd rather get my jamming words in first, so 
When you're playing with desire
Don't come running to my place when it burns like fire, boy.

Sweet about me 
Nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me 
Nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me 
Nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me 
Nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me 
Nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me 
Nothing sweet about me, yeah
