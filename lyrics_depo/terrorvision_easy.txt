Living out three separate lives,
with nothing else to do besides, it's easy,
They'd wrote Bradford off the map,
then all that old commercial crap, it's easy.
Hassle bound? Not me,
I'm happy and it's easy and it's free.

They'd nothing really good to say,
they're here tomorrow gone today, it's easy,
Setting off and duck the flack,
flowed like water off the back, it's easy.

Hassle bound? Not me,
I'm happy and it's easy and it's free.

Travelling round is really nice,
pay the sights then see the price, it's easy,
Take it in then put it out,
it's simply what it's all about, it's easy,
Stick together till the end,
only the best know to pretend, it's easy,
If I could live my life again,
I'd influence a lot more friends, it's easy.

Hassle bound? Not me,
I'm happy and it's easy and it's free.
Hassle bound? Not me,
I'm happy and it's easy and it's free.
