From Jamaica to the world 
It's just love, It's just love, 

Why most the children play in the street? 
Broken arms can fade the dreams 
Peace on earth to everyone that you meet 
Don't you worry, It could be so sweet 

Just look to the rainbow you will see, 
The sun will shine 'till eternity 
I've got so much love in my heart 
No one can tear it apart 

Feel the love generation 
Feel the love generation 

Come on, come on, come on, 

Feel the Love Generation 
Feel the Love Generation 

Don't worry about a thing, gonna be all right 

Why most the children play in the street? 
Broken arms can fade the dreams 
Peace on earth to everyone that you meet 
Don't you worry, It could be so sweet 

Just look to the rainbow you will see, 
The sun will shine 'till eternity 
I've got so much love in my heart 
No one can tear it apart
