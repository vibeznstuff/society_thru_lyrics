Get out my head
Get out my head

Oh you just don’t know,
How much you messed up my flow
How much you messed up my flow
So high but now I’m low
Oh thinking about you,
Wasting all my time on you,
You used to feel so brand new,
You mean nothing to me

Oh you just don’t know
Get out my head
Oh you just don’t know
You used to feel so brand new
Get out my head

You got to get out my head

Get out my head

Oh you just don’t know,
How much you messed up my flow
How much you messed up my flow
So high but now I’m low
Oh thinking about you,
Wasting all my time on you,
You used to feel so brand new,
You mean nothing to me

You ruin my flow ey ey ey ey ey
You ruin my flow ey ey ey ey ey
You ruin my flow, get out my head, ey ey
Get out my head,
You ruin my flow,
Get out my head,
You got to get, you got to get,
You got to get, out my head

Get out my head,
Get out my head,
Get out my head,
You got to get, you got to get,
You got to get, out my head

Oh you just don’t know,
How much you messed up my flow
How much you messed up my flow
So high but now I’m low
Oh thinking about you,
Wasting all my time on you,
You used to feel so brand new,
You mean nothing to me

Oh, you just don’t know
Get out my head
Get out my head

You got to get, you got to get,
You got to get, out my head
