Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Now tell me what ya gonna do
When it ain't nowhere to run
When judgment comes for you
When judgement comes for you
Now tell me what ya gonna do
When it ain't nowhere to hide
When judgment comes for you
Cause it's gonna come for you


Let's all bring it in for Wally
Eazy-E, Uncle Charlie
Little Boo Boo - God's got him
And I'm gonna miss everybody
I done rolled and blows my gauge
Looked at him while he lay
When playing with destiny, play too deep for me to say
Lil' Layzie came to me, told me if he should decease:
"Well then please bury me by my Gran Gran
And when you can, come follow me"


God bless you working on a plan to heaven
Follow the Lord all 24/7 days
God is who we praise even though the Devil's all up in my face
He keepin me safe and in my place
Say grace to the gates we race
Without a chance to face the judge
Then I guess my soul won’t budge
Grudge, because there’s no mercy for thugs
Ohhhhhh what can I do, it's all about a family and how we roll
Can I get a witness not enough fool
We livin' our lives to eternal our souls ay o ayo


Pray and we pray, and we pray and we pray and we pray
Every day, every day, every day, every day
And we pray and we pray and we pray and we pray
Still we lacing


Now follow me roll stroll
Whether it's hell or it's heaven
Come let's go take a visit to the people that's long gone they rest
Wally, Eazy, Terry, Boo
And still keepin up wit they family
Exactly how many days we got lastin'
While you laughin' we're passin' passin' away
God rest our souls cause I know I might meet you up at the crossroads
Y'all know, yall forever got love from them Bone Thugs baby


Lil E-Z long gone
Really wish he could come home
But when it's time to die, gotta go bye bye
All 'lil thug could do was cry, cry
Why'd they kill my dog
Damn man I miss my Uncle Charles y'all
And he shouldn't be gone
In front of his home, what they did to Boo was wrong
Oh so wrong, was so wrong, gotta hold on, gotta stay strong
When the day comes
Better believe Bone got a shoulder you can lean on, lean on


Pray and we pray, and we pray and we pray and we pray
Every day, every day, every day, every day
And we pray and we pray and we pray and we pray
Still we lacing


See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely


And I'm gonna miss everybody
And I'm gonna miss every lottie
And I'm gonna miss everybody
And I'm gonna miss every lottie
And I'm gonna miss everybody
And I'm gonna miss every lottie


Livin' in a hateful world
Sending me (straight to heaven)
That's how we roll
Livin' in a hateful world
Sending me (straight to heaven)
That's how we roll
Livin' in a hateful world
Sending me (straight to heaven)
That's how we roll
And I ask the good lord why
He sigh, he told me we live to die


Whats up with that murder y'all?
See my little cousin was hung
Somebody really wrong anybody wanna touch that star?
And Ms. Sleazy set up Eazy to fall
You know while we sinning
He intendin' on endin' it when it ends
He comin' again and again and again
Now tell me what ya gonna do


Can somebody anybody tell me why, hey
Can somebody anybody tell me why
We died, we die
I don't wanna die
(Oh so wrong, oh wrong, oh so wrong, oh wrong)


See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely
