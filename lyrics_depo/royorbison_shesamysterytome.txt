Darkness falls and she will take me by the hand
Take me to some twilight land
Where all but love is grey
Where I can't find my way
Without her as my guide

Night falls I'm cast beneath her spell
Daylight comes our heaven turns to hell
Am I left to burn
and burn eternally

She's a mystery to me
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl

In the night of love words tangled in her hair
Words soon to disappear
A love so sharp it cut like a switchblade to my heart
words tearing me apart
She tears again my bleeding heart
I want to run she's pulling me apart
Fallen angel cries
And I just melt away
She's a mystery to me
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl

Haunted by her side it's the darkness in her eyes
That so enslaves me
But if my love is blind then I don't want to see
She's a mystery to me

Night falls I'm cast beneath her spell
Daylight comes our heaven turns to hell
Am I left to burn
and burn eternally

She's a mystery to me
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl
