Tempered by greed
Tall buildings breathe
Give a sigh of relief when it's night

Stirring from sleep
We night owls creep
Is there any sign of life under this stone?
Oooh

Star
Chime
Hollow and true
Love
Child
Weep for me
And I will cast your wheels in motion
Walk with me
The inner reaches of emotion

Sheltered by creed
One piled on one
Do you have a little room for one small one
Oooh

Light
Shine
Wild and free
Sun
Rise
Weep for me
And I will set your wheels in motion
Keep with me
And like a roller on the ocean
Stand by me
And I will fill you with devotion
Walk with me
The inner reaches of emotion

(Here we are)
(In the sunshine)
(Everything)
(Is fine)
(Here we are)
(Everything)
(Everything is fine)

Weep for me
The sands of time will fill the ocean
Keep with me
Till rays of sunshine fill the ocean
Walk with me
The inner reaches of emotion
Stand with me
And I will fill you with devotion

Weep for me
The sands of time will fill the ocean
Keep with me
And like a roller on the ocean
Stand by me
And I will fill you with devotion
Walk with me
The inner reaches of emotion

The sands of time will fill the ocean
Keep with me
And rays of sunshine fill the ocean
Walk with me
The inner reaches of emotion
