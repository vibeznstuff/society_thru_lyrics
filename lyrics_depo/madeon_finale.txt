(Whoa)
Brace yourself
Brace yourself
(Whoa)

(Ooh)
Your last chance
Last summer
Your last dance
Beat to your own drummer
Go out fighting
Go out young
A flash of lightning
Eclipse the sun
(Brace yourself)


Brace yourself, brace yourself
Brace yourself, brace yourself

(Brace yourself for the grand finale)

Your last chance
Last summer
Your last dance
Beat to your own drummer
Go out fighting
Go out young
A flash of lightning
Eclipse the sun
(Eclipse the sun)

Brace yourself
Brace yourself
