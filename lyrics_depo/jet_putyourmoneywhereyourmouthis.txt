She's a loaded gun
In my shakin' hands
Am I in hell
Or the promised land

What's your name
(She said I'll tell you my name when im on your skin)
You can be
(You can be the queen and I'll be the king)
I was born
(I was born to echo &amp; I'll never repeat, not 4 anyone)



I'll show you what I got
When you tell me what you need
So put ya money where ya mouth is

When the beat goes on
She knows that nothing's wrong
She goes down
like the setting sun

What's your name
(I said I'll tell you my name, you got to let me in)
You can be
(You can be the sinner and I'll be the sin)
I will take
(I'll take what I want and its easy to see I got everything)
Everything

I'll show you what I got
When you tell me what you need
So put ya money where ya mouth is

I'll show you what I got
When you tell me what you need
So put ya money where ya mouth is
