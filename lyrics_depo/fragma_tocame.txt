If your gonna save the day
And your hearing what I say
I feel your touch, your kiss
Is not enough
And if you believe in me 
Don't think my loves for free
I wont take nothing less
Than a deeper love

Let me tell you, you
You know 
IIIIIIIII, I need a miracle
I need a miracle
Its more than physical 
What I need to feel from you

Tell me that you understand 
And you take me as I am
You'll always be the one to give me everything
Just as I thought no-one cares
Your the answer to my prayers
You lift my spirits high
Come on and rescue me

Let me tell you, you
You know 
IIIIIIII, I need a miracle
I need a miracle 
Its more than physical
What I need to feel from you

Let me tell you, you
You know 
IIIIIIII, I need a miracle
I need a miracle 
Its more than physical
What I need to get me through

Heyyyyyy ,
I need a miracle, I need a miracle
Ohhhhhh ohhhhhhh,
I need a miracle, I need a miracle

Let me tell you, you
You know 
IIIIIIII, I need a miracle
I need a miracle 
Its more than physical
What I need to get me through

Let me tell you, you
You know 
IIIIIIIII, I need a miracle
I need a miracle
Its more than physical 
What I need to feel from you
