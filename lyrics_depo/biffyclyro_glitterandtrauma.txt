Diamonds, glitter and trauma tears, with an unfriendly atmosphere.
We'll make our night, we'll make tonight.

Your potential is underused, your skin will break into jigsaw shaped pieces of meat, you'll fall
apart.

You can save them all.
I believe that you can.
Even though... you never listen.
You never listen.

But you are, the human, strobe.
You are the human strobe.

We are, like lightening, surrounded.
You are the human strobe.

Slaughtered moments and useless tales, encourage others to take the blame.
I love you when, you're not around.

You can save them all.
I believe that you can.
Even though... you never listen.
You never listen.

Let's take aim, you're looking the other way.
The right target, she's looking the other way.
There's no wreckage, I'll help you to do it right, tonight... we'll make it ours.

You are, the human, strobe.
You are the human strobe.

We are, like lightening, surrounded.
You are the human strobe.

Let's take aim, I'll help you to do it right.
Tonight... we'll make it ours.

You are, the human, strobe.
You are the human strobe.

We are, like lightening, surrounded.
You are the human strobe.
