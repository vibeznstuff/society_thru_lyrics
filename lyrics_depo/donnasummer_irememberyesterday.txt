I remember that first night we wet
Dancing to the sound of clarinets
Dancing cheek to cheek, oh how sweet
You and me and this fantasy
Oh, I remember our first night

I remember how we carried on
On and on until the light of dawn
From the very start, you stole my heart
I knew right then we would never part
Oh, I remember that first night

Remember that first night
Remember that first night
Remember that first night

I saw your lovelight through the candle's glow
Champagne was flowing, and so I let myself go
And when the night was over,
We both looked around the room
Remember darling, chairs on the table,
And only me and you

I remember how we carried on
On and on until the light of dawn
And from the very start, you stole my heart
I knew right then we would never part
I remember that first night

Remember that first night
Remember that first night
Remember that first night

Walk me home in springtime showers
In the early morning hours
You took me to my door, we were sure
So we swore that forever more
I'll remember our first night

Remember that first night
Remember that first night
Remember that first night
