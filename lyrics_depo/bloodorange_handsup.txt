Do you ever try and face yourself, goodnight
Or is it easier with your friend?
Pretend your friend's enough to end
You were just a lover, love , girl
Could you press skin, take your lover the world
You're not the only one in the world
You choose to see me, even with all this glee

Are you okay?
What's in your way?

Are you sleeping with the lights on baby?
(Hands up, get out, hands up, get out)
Keep your hood off when you're walking cause they
(Hands up, get out, hands up, get out)
Trying not to be obsessed with your haitin
(Hands up, get out, hands up, get out)
Sure enough they're gonna take your body
(Hands up, get out, hands up, get out)

Something never been done before
Then it's no replacement for it
When there is a replacement for something
It will always
