It's complicated, it always is, that's just the way it goes 
Feels like I've waited so long for this, I wonder if it shows?
Head under water now I can breath, it never felt so good.
Cause I can feel it coming over me I wouldn't stop it if I could

When love takes over, yeah
You know you can't deny
When love takes over, yeah
Cause something's here tonight

Give me a reason I gotta know, do you feel it too ?
Can't you see me here on overload, and this time I blame you...
Ohhh... Looking out for U to hold my hand, it feels like I could fall
Now love me right like I know you can, we could loose it all

When love takes over, yeah
You know you can't deny
When love takes over, yeah
Cause something's here tonight 
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

I'll be loving all the time, it's true
Cause I want to make it right with you

When love takes over,
When love takes over,
When love takes over,
When love takes over,
When love takes over,
When love takes over,
When love takes over,
Over, Over, Over, Over, Over, Over, Over, Over, Over, Over

When love takes over, yeah
You know you can't deny
When love takes over, yeah
Cause something's here tonight.
