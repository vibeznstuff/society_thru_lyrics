Take time for your pleasure
And laugh with love
Take the hand of another
And sing for the wings of a dove

Wo-oh, wo-oh
For the wings of a dove
Wo-oh, wo-oh
For the wings of a dove

Look up at the rooftops
When you're walking round
Don't think for a moment
Of looking down

Wo-oh, wo-oh (yeah, yeah, yeah)
For the wings of a dove
Wo-oh, wo-oh
For the wings of a dove

Wo-oh, wo-oh
For the wings of a dove
Wo-oh, wo-oh
For the wings of a dove

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Look up at the rooftops
When you're walking round
Don't think for a moment
Of looking down

A room at the top
Where we're not allowed
Cheer to the echo
Can you hear the sound

Wo-oh, wo-oh (yeah, yeah, yeah)
For the wings of a dove
Wo-oh, wo-oh (yeah, yeah, yeah)
For the wings of a dove
