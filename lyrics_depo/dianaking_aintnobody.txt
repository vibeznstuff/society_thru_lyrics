I wanna tell you, baby
There ain't nobody like you
Like you, ohohoho
Mmm, oho
Like you

Captured effortlessly
That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love

The next thing I felt was you
Holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song

Filled my heart with your kiss
Gave me freedom
If I turned, I'd resist
I needed someone

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way

Ain't nobody (Ain't nobody)
Loves me better than you

Nobody

I wait for night time to come
And bring you to me
Can't believe I'm the one
I was so lonely

I feel like no one could feel
I must be dreamin'
I want this dream to be real
I need this feelin'

I make my wish upon a star
Hope this night will last forever
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Ain't nobody (Nobody)
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way (Nobody, baby)

Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you
Nobody makes me feel this way

And first you put your arms around me
Then you put your charms around me
I can't resist this sweet surrender
Oh, the nights are warm and tender
We stare into each other's eyes, yeah
And what we see is no surprise
I've got a feeling most with treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
