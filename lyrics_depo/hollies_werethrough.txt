I should be better off without you
You take a pride in making me blue
I'm telling you my friend
It's got to be the end
We're through

I told you time and time again
You told me he was just a friend
But I found out some way
I've seen him every day
With you

'Cause you never treat me tenderly
You got no reason for leaving me
'Cause I can't leave you alone
'Cause I knew from the start
You'd be tearing me apart
Sooner or later



'Cause you never treat me tenderly
You got no reason for leaving me
'Cause I can't leave you alone
'Cause I knew from the start
You'd be tearing me apart
Sooner or later

And now my crying days are through
No longer shed a tear for you
I'm telling you my friend
It's got to be the end
We're through
We're through
We're through
