Goodbye to love again
I've seen the signs again
For love has never lived
Here long before
I'm on my own again
I'm all alone again
For love has never stayed
And closed the door

Sometimes I wake up in the night
With no one beside me
I turn the radio on
Just for company
Sometimes I wake up in the night
I've found that I've been crying, crying
Oh Lord in my sleep again

Goodbye to love again
Until next time again yeah
I'll just keep going on, going on, going on, oh oh oh oh

Goodbye to love again
Until next time again
I'll just keep going on
As I've done before
Be on my own again
Be all alone again
Until love comes to stay
And close the door

Sometimes I wake up in the night
With no one beside me
I turn the radio on
Just for company
Sometimes I wake up in the night
I've found that I've been crying, crying
Oh Lord in my sleep again

Goodbye to love again
Until next time again yeah
I'll just keep going on, going on, going on, oh oh oh oh
Until next time again, time again, time again yeah
Goodbye to love again
