Spent the last year
Rocky Mountain way
Couldn't get much higher
Out to pasture
Think it's safe to say
Time to open fire

And we don't need the ladies
Cryin' 'cause the story's sad
'Cause the Rocky Mountain way
Is better than the way we had
Whoa-oh-oh

Well he's tellin' us this
And he's tellin' us that
Changes it ev'ry day
Says it doesn't matter
Bases are loaded
And Casey's at bat
Playin' it play-by-play
Time to change the batter

And we don't need the ladies
Cryin' 'cause the story's sad, uh huh
Rocky Mountain way
Is better than the way we had
Yeah-ah-ah
