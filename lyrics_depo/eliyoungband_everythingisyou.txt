Eternal flame came on the radio
And I remember how you loved it so
Memories sneak up on me, wherever I go

A car like you used to drive
Pulled beside me today at the light
Chances to break and cry wherever I go

And you want me to be strong, any less just shows I'm weak
How'd ya turn so cold, where's the girl I used to know

And it's love and hate and all these emotions
I never thought that you'd be going
Now I'm just going through the motions
Where everything is you, everything is you

An inside joke comes to mind
We'd wear them out all the time
Memories sneak up on me wherever I go

And it seems you've disappeared, though you're not that far away
Please tell me it's not true, I didn't mean that much to you

And it's love and hate and all these emotions
I never thought that you'd be going
Now I'm just going through the motions
Where everything is you, everything is you

What did I do wrong, nothing I treated you like an angel
What did I do wrong, nothing I treated you like an angel
What did I do wrong, nothing I treated you like an angel
I treated you like an angel

And it's love and hate and all these emotions
I never thought that you'd be going
Now I'm just going through the motions
Where everything is you, everything is you

I treated you like an angel..
