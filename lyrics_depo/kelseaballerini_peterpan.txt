The smile, the charm, the words, the spark,
Everything, you had it
I guess I had a naive heart,
'Cause, boy, I let you have it

You said I was your only,
Never thought you'd leave me lonely

You're just a lost boy
With your head up in the clouds
You're just a lost boy
Never keep your feet on the ground

Always gonna fly away, just because you know you can
Never gonna learn there's no such place as a Neverland
You don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man,
Peter Pan

Deep down, I knew that you were too good to be true
But every piece and part of me wanted to believe in you
Now it's "Happily Ever Never"
I guess now I know better

You're just a lost boy
With your head up in the clouds
You're just a lost boy
Never keep your feet on the ground

Always gonna fly away, just because you know you can
Never gonna learn there's no such place as a Neverland
You don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man,
Peter Pan

You're just a lost boy,
Yeah, I know who you are
And you don't know what you lost, boy,
Too busy chasing stars

And you're always gonna fly away, just because you know you can
Never gonna learn there's no such place as a Neverland
You don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man

You're never gonna grow up
Yeah, you're never gonna be a man,
Peter Pan

Never gonna be a man
