She comes home late at night
Kicks her high-heels off and sighs
Lays down on the bed

She said it's been a long day at work
I couldn't wait til I got home
Just to be with you again

Lord I love just to watch her sleeping
Yeah I just pull the covers up and wonder what she's dreaming

When she's wrapped up with her t-shirt on
Got the lights turned way down low
Radio's got her favorite song on
And man she's singing right along
Let your hair down
Baby let it fall
Rip the phone cord out the wall
Whisper love you while drifting off again
Whenever we're alone yeah

Took her out last Friday night
Let her dance under neon lights
And that girl she's turning heads
Stranger's eyes right on my girl
I can't blame him man she's beautiful
She's coming home with me

Lord her beauty it's hard to hide
Counting my blessings every night mmmm

When she's wrapped up with her t-shirt on
Got the lights turned way down low
Radio's got her favorite song
And man she's singing right along
Let your hair down
Baby let it fall
Rip the phone cord out the wall
Whisper love you while drifting off again
Whenever we're alone
Whenever we're alone

When she's wrapped up with her t-shirt on
Got the lights turned way down low
Radio's got her favorite song
And man she's singing right along
Let your hair down
Baby let it fall
Rip the phone cord out the wall
Whisper love you while you're drifting off
Whenever we're alone
