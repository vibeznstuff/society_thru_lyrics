It's Christmastime, there's no need to be afraid
At Christmastime, we let in light and we banish shade


And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime


But say a prayer, Pray for the other ones
At Christmastime it's hard, but when you're having fun


There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear


Where the only water flowing 


Is the bitter sting of tears


And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom


Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you


And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life


Where nothing ever grows
No rain nor rivers flow


Do they know it's Christmastime at all?


Here's to you


Raise a glass for everyone


Spare a thought this yuletide for the deprived
If the table was turned would you survive


Here's to them


Underneath that burning sun


You ain't gotta feel guilt just selfless
Give a little help to the helpless


Do they know it's Christmastime at all?


Feed the world


Feed the world


Feed the world 


Feed the world


Feed the world 
Let them know it's Christmastime again - 


Feed the world 


Feed the world -
