Da, na, na, na, na
Yeah no shit, no shit


Body like a model, booty so colossal
I wanna grip her like the bottom of the bottle
Drop it down low, bring it up real slow
'Bout to go down, make me say oh no
Body like a model, booty so colossal
I wanna grip her like the bottom of the bottle
Drop it down low, bring it up real slow
'Bout to go down, make me say oh no
Drop it down low, bring it up slow, yo, yo
Drop it down low, bring it up slow, yo, yo


Uh, back in it, it been a minute
Here she go with all that "where you been at?"
I been at it, tryna get it
Gotta admit it, I look good with it
You would look good sitting in my car when I start the engine
Left an impression on her greater than my grand entrance
Now she wrapped up in that jet living
Imagining herself in the wifey position
Naked under aprons in the kitchen while I'm blazing something amazing
Plan the next mission, she share my dollar sign vision
And she finer than that fine print contract, big business
Bottom line, she can get it, let her have it, then she feel it


Body like a model, booty so colossal
I wanna grip her like the bottom of the bottle
Drop it down low, bring it up real slow
'Bout to go down, make me say oh no
Body like a model, booty so colossal
I wanna grip her like the bottom of the bottle
Drop it down low, bring it up real slow
'Bout to go down, make me say oh no
Drop it down low, bring it up slow, yo, yo
Drop it down low, bring it up slow, yo, yo


Uh, give it to me baby
Bust them legs open like some scissors for me baby
She know all kind of positions, I'm like "Isn't she creative?"
She my misses to be, maybe, then that shit will smell likes daises
She know if it was a fifth then we would post some shots and take them
She'll be safe cause me and her make a real good combination
Every day she wear her birthday suit, happy belated
Then she drop it down low and pick it up like elevators
Oh Lord, no draws
She give me top and bottom, no charge
She throw it at a nigga like a snowball
And I'mma give her something she can choke on
Lil Tunechi, yeah


Body like a model, booty so colossal
I wanna grip her like the bottom of the bottle
Drop it down low, bring it up real slow
'Bout to go down, make me say oh no
Body like a model, booty so colossal
I wanna grip her like the bottom of the bottle
Drop it down low, bring it up real slow
'Bout to go down, make me say oh no
Drop it down low, bring it up slow, yo, yo
Drop it down low, bring it up slow, yo, yo


Yeah, back in it, it been a minute
Here she go with all that "Where you been at?"
A little talking, a little dinner
And then we fuck, she smile when we finish


Body like a model, booty so colossal
I wanna grip her like the bottom of the bottle
Drop it down low, bring it up real slow
'Bout to go down, make me say oh no
Body like a model, booty so colossal
I wanna grip her like the bottom of the bottle
Drop it down low, bring it up real slow
'Bout to go down, make me say oh no
Drop it down low, bring it up slow, yo, yo
Drop it down low, bring it up slow, yo, yo


Drop it, drop it, bring it up slow, bring it up slow
(I'm pissed I had to be the last one to get heard)
