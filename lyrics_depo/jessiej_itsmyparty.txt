You're stuck in the playground and I'm a grown woman now
Considering you hate me, you're stalking like you made me
So why you acting like you're tough
But now I thought you'd had enough
Don't you get tired of being rude
Awww, Come and give me a hug dude

Let's go!

It's my party, I do, do what I want (do, do what I want)
So while you sit and watch me
I keep dancing alone, da-dancing alone
So put this record on and keep it going 'til I say, "Stop!"
If you were wondering if I give a damn, well, I do not
'Cause it's my party, I do, do what I want (do, do what I want)
(Woah-oh, Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) 

I think it's time you realize
You're only wasting your time
Addicted to attention, you need an intervention
So while you acting like you're sick
Sitting around and talking shit
Don't you get tired of being alone

Awww, your only friend is your phone

OWWWW!

OW! It's my party, I do, do what I want (do, do what I want)
So while you sit and watch me
I keep dancing alone, da-dancing alone
So put this record on and keep it going 'til I say, "Stop!"
If you were wondering if I give a damn, well, I do not
'Cause it's my party, I do, do what I want (do, do what I want)
(Woah-oh, Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) 

You think I speak too much, I don't care, don't care
You think I tweet too much, I don't care, don't care
You think my clothes are crazy, I don't care, don't care
Well maybe I'm crazy, cray cray cray c'mon!

It's my party, I do, do what I want (do, do what I want)
So while you sit and watch me
I keep dancing alone, da-dancing alone (alone)
So put this record on and keep it going 'til I say, "Stop!"
If you were wondering if I give a damn, well, I do not
'Cause it's my party, I do, do what I want (do, do what I want)
(Woah-oh, Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
