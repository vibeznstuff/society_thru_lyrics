Sweet love
Sweet love
Sweet love
Of mine 
Sweet love
Sweet love
Sweet love
Of mine

I was broken, I was blind
Lost in a moment I thought I left behind
Then you woke up this dark soul of mine
Carrying a light I thought I'd never find

When you found me, I was all alone
The whole world around me, but nowhere to call home
I heard your voice sing like heaven's choir
Gathered up my fears and threw them in the fire

Oh, my darling, sweet love of mine
I'll hold you all through the night
I gave you your name; you gave me back my life
You're the heart of me, oh, sweet love of mine
You're the heart of me, oh, sweet love of mine

Oh, my darling, sweet love of mine
I'll hold you all through the night
I gave you your name; you gave me back my life
You're the heart of me, oh, sweet love of mine
You're the heart of me, oh, sweet love of mine

Sweet love
Sweet love
Sweet love
Of mine 
Sweet love
Sweet love
Sweet love
Of mine
