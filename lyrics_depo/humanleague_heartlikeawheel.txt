Calling up the promised land
Johnny Seven's coming over the sea
He's taking your time
When you want to be free

Holding out a helping hand
Are you ready for a real career
Will you be so cool
When it's happening here

It don't say nothing that I haven't heard
If what I hear is true
You won't keep the law with a broken word
So what are you gonna do

Heart like a wheel
Turning away
From anything that's real
Heart like a wheel
Changing in time
Beating colder steel

Pass the message around the world
The medium is in retreat
The power is here
And packing some heat

Sell your soul to a holy war
Set the captive free
We make no promises anymore
But it isn't fooling me

Heart like a wheel
Turning away
From anything that's real
Heart like a wheel
Changing in time
Beating colder steel

You can't keep the wheels turning anymore
With anger, blood, and fear
Or make any friends with an M16
When you blast your way through here
Oh

Heart like a wheel
Turning away
From anything that's real
Heart like a wheel
Changing in time
Beating colder steel

Heart like a wheel
Turning away
From anything that's real
Heart like a wheel
Changing in time
Beating colder steel

Heart like a wheel
Turning away
From anything that's real
Heart like a wheel
Driving the world
Is gonna be a steal
