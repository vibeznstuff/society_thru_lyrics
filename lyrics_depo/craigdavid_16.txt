Mmm yeah, break it down break it down let me break it it down
Break it on down, oh yeah

I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
She phoned said, "hey boy, come on right around"

So I knock at the door
You were standing with a bottle of red wine
Ready to pour
Dressed in long black Satin, laced to the floor
So I went in
Then we sat down start kissing
Caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi
Sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean me and her
Her Parents were kinda cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying parents trying to find out what we were up to, ooh yeah

Saying fill me in
Why were you creepin' round, why were you creepin' round late last night?
Can you fill me in?
Why were you creepin', why why were you creepin' round late last night?
Can you fill me in?
Why were you creepin' round, why were you creepin' round late last night?
Can you fill me in?
Why were you creepin' why why were you creepin' round?

Yo, spit a 16 a sick quick 16
I been doing this since I was 16
Been a few years let's call it 16
A brand new flow for 2016
Spit a 16 a sick quick 16
I been doing this since I was 16
Been a few years let's call it 16
A brand new flow for 2016
Seen it's like I'm living a dream
1999 when I first came on the scene
Skinny young breh from out of Southampton
With a bunch of melodies for days, know what I mean?
Lean and mean, embodied the whole scene
Packing on muscle like bars of protein
Crushing every microphone that I be holding
'Cos you know I be training dirty but same time keeping it clean

Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, "hey girl, come on right around"
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cos you felt cold

I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying fill me in
Why were you creepin' round, why were you creepin' round late last night?
Can you fill me in?
Why were you creepin', why why were you creepin' ooh yeah, ooh yeah

Seen, so let me run up on this beat
No nonsense whenever you're around me
It don't make sense, my time ain't wasting
If I come to mess about we all know that's a long ting
But then I sing I flip the whole ting
One verse sung next verse I be rapping
And if I get bored of the beat that's thumping
Man like me a press stop and just start beatboxing
