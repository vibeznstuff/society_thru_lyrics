Baby if you've got to go away don't think I could take the pain,
won't you stay another day?
Oh don't leave me alone like this,
don't you say it's the final kiss,
won't you stay another day?

Don't you know we've come too far now,
just to go and try to throw it all away.
Thought I heard you say you love me,
that your love was gonna be here to stay.
I've only just begun to know you,
all I can say is won't you stay just one more day?

Baby if you've got to go away don't think I could take the pain,
won't you stay another day?
Oh don't leave me alone like this,
don't you say it's the final kiss,
won't you stay another day?

I touch your face while you are sleeping
and hold your hand,
don't understand what's going on.
Good times we had return to haunt me,
though it's for you,
all that I do seems to be wrong.

Baby if you've got to go away don't think I could take the pain,
won't you stay another day?
Oh don't leave me alone like this,
don't you say it's the final kiss,
won't you stay another day?

Baby if you've got to go away don't think I could take the pain,
won't you stay another day?
Oh don't leave me alone like this,
don't you say it's the final kiss,
won't you stay another day?

Baby if you've got to go away don't think I could take the pain,
won't you stay another day?
Oh don't leave me alone like this,
don't you say it's the final kiss,
won't you stay another day?
