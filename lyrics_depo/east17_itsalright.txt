Don't you worry, cos it's alright
Don't you worry, child of the night
Cos in the morning,
Come with the new day sun
Love - an everlasting light

We are the seed of the new breed
We'll succeed our time has come
We are the new
These words are true
Let the light of love shine through
It's alright 
It's really alright
It's alright
It's really alright

Alright, alright
Everything's gonna be alright 
Alright, alright it's ready alright

No don't be so sad
Cos love is by your side
No don't be so sad
Cos life is 2 short 2 live
No don't be so sad
I'll be mad if you're this
It's alright
The message that I give

Listen 2 me
Dreams can come true
Call out 2 love
It will answer you
4 get your trouble and smile
Let your heart speak awhile
Let the light of love shine through

Take your nightmare
Change 2 dream
Flow in the rhythm like a stream
Fear no evil, fear no man
Open up the mind
And the beats goes bam
Rhythm rolling, running smooth
Just like a little love
Sent 2 soothe
Ease the pressure, let it all go
Don't be afraid let the feeling flow
