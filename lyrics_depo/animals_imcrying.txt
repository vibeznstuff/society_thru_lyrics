I don't hear your knock upon my door
I don't have your lovin' anymore
Since you been gone I'm a-hurtin' inside
Well I want you baby by my side, Yeah
I'm cryin', I'm cryin'
Hear me cryin' baby
Hear me cryin'
I'm lonely and blue baby every night
Yeah, you know you didn't treat me right
And now my tears begin to fall
Well I want you baby and that's all
I'm cryin', I'm cryin'
Hear me cryin' baby
Hear me cryin'
I don't hear your knock upon my door
I don't have your lovin' anymore
Since you been gone I'm hurtin' inside, yeah
Well I want you baby by my side
But I'm cryin', you know I'm cryin'
Hear me cryin' baby
Hear me cryin'
Hear me cryin'
