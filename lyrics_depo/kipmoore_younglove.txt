Your daddy thought I was wrong for you,
Thinking back your mom did too
But two wrongs never felt so right
It was written in the stars,
For two young and wild at hearts
To sneak out late into the night

You'd climb in and take my hand
And you slide on over, on over and we'd ride

'Cause young love don't know nothin'
When the radio plays you sing along
When she's holdin' on
You just can't get close enough,
You swear it's sent from above
It's real, it's good, and it's young love

Remember that time you were supposed to be
At your friend Kate's and not with me
In Panama City a hundred miles away
And that damned old truck of mine broke down,
Your old man cussed me out
And swore that's the last I'd see your face

But I'd pull into your neighbor's drive and cut the lights,
And you slide on over, on over and we'd ride

'Cause young love don't know nothin'
When the radio plays you sing along
When she's holdin' on
You just can't get close enough,
You swear it's sent from above
It's real, it's good, and it's young love

Oh, yeah

There was really no way of knowing
But look at us, baby, we're still going

Young love don't know nothin'
When the radio plays you sing along
All damn night long,
You just can't get close enough,
You swear it's sent from above
It's real, it's good, and it's still young love
Young love

Oh, yeah
