Just stop you know you cant deny
Just stop you know there's no reply
I've had it all don't say that
Just stop and tell me it's good bye

Don't you understand
What I'm saying
We never gave ourselves the chance
You know I've got to get away

Run, leave you behind
The world goes slowly
So sad to leave this time
The ring you were holding

Has hit the floor
And I cant live in this house with you no more
This time you know you'll hesitate
Deep down you hope it's not too late

You said it all except good bye
I think it's time that WE should try
Don't you understand
What I'm saying

We never gave ourselves the chance
You know I've got to get away
Run, leave you behind
The world goes slowly

So sad to leave this time
The ring you were holding
Has hit the floor
And I cant live in this house with you no more

Because I know
I still loved you
And I cant stay another day
Get away

You know I've got to get away
Get away

You know I've got to get away

You know I've got to get away

Run, lea
