I can feel a new expression on my face
I can feel a glowing sensation taking place
I can hear the guitars playing lovely tunes
Every time that you walk in the room

I close my eyes for a second and pretend it's me you want
Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
I feel the summer's night with a magic moon
Every time that you walk in the room

Baby it's a dream come true
Standing right alongside of you
Wish I could show you how much I care
But I only have the nerve to stare

I can feel there's something pounding in my brain
Just anytime that someone speaks your name
Trumpets sound and I hear thunder boom
Every time that you
Every time that you
Every time that you walk in the room
Walk in the room
Walk in the room
Walk in the room
