Yeah!

Well you can bump and grind
If it's good for your mind
Well you can twist and shout
Let it all hang out


But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No no no

Well you can tear a plane
In the falling rain
I drive a Rolls Royce
'Cos its good for my voice



Yeah!

But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No way!

Hey

Wow
