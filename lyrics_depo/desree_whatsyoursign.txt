What's your sign, do you know?
Let me guess, you're Scorpio
What's your rising?
Where's your moon?
Scorpios are pretty cool
See I'm a sage
Ha ha ha, so they say
I'm a butterfly, I like to play
I'm always aiming into the sky
I point my arrows extremely high

'Cause everyone has a sign
Whether supernatural or divine
Believe or not if you're so inclined
'Cause in this great big universe
We're the stars on earth

See the man over there
  (Doo doot, doo doot)
He's a Leo, check his hair
  (Doo doot, doo doot)
Virgo eyes, Aries smile
  (Doo doot, doo doot)
I like the Leo, check his style
  (Doo doot, doo doot)

When the night is good and clear
  (Doo doot, doo doot)
I hear a whisper in a my ear
  (Doo doot, doo doot)
If you follow the Nothern Star
  (Doo doot, doo doot)
You will always know just where you are
  (Doo doot, doo doot)

'Cause everyone has a sign
Whether supernatural or divine
Believe or not if you're so inclined
'Cause in this great big universe
We're the stars on earth
We are stars, doo doot, doo doot, doo yeah
We are stars, doo doot, doo doot, doo yeah
We are stars, 'cause in this great big universe
