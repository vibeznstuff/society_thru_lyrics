First things first about last night,
Its down to me to put things right,
Cause your always on my mind.

I left at 5 to be back at 8,
I went for one, now I'm lost in space
But your always on my mind.

And if I tell you girl the moment that I met you,
I knew my life would change and now I can't forget you,
Your the one believe me now.

One more night alone,
In my head,
I can't live without you,
One more night alone,
In my bed,
We can't have one more night alone.

I see those girls but I pay no attention
Cause your always on my mind
And I may stray, but it's not my intention
Cause your all that's on my mind.

And if I tell you girl the moment that I met you,
I knew my life would change and now I can't forget you,
Your the one believe me now.

One more night alone
In my head, I can't live without you,
One more night alone
In my bed, I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Yooouuur still the one, and I can't live without you
Aaaalways the one, we can have one more night alone
(One more night alone)
(One more night alone)
(One more night alone)

Yooouuur still the one, and i can't live without you
Aaaaalways the one, we can have one more night alone

One more night alone
In my head, I can't live without you,
One more night alone
In my bed, I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Yooouuur still the one, and I can't live without you
Aaaalways the one, we can have one more night alone
