What if I told you
It was all meant to be
Would you believe me?
Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling
That we've met before
So tell me that you dont think I'm crazy
When I tell you that love has come here &amp; now


A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
Ohh I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this


Everything changes, but beauty remains
Somethings so tender
I can't explain
Ohh well I may be dreaming
But till I awake
Can't we make this dream last forever
And I cherish all the love that we shared



Could this be the greatest love of all
I wanna know that you will
Catch me when I fall
So let me tell you this
