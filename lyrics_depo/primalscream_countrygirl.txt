You never get too big, you never get too heavy
You never get too cool that you stop paying your dues
Oh yeah! What can a poor boy do?
You better go back to you mama, she'll take care of you
Lost your wife, lost your son
Stay out drinking 'til the morning comes
Oh yeah! What can a poor boy do?
You better go back to you mama, she'll take care of you

Country girl take my hand, lead me through this diseased land
I am tired, I am weak, I am worn
I have stole I have sinned, oh my soul is unclean
Country girl got to keep on keeping on, yeah

Crazy women, mess your head
Wake up drunk and bleeding in some strange bed
Oh yeah! What can a poor boy do?
You better go back to your mama, she'll take care of you

Country girl take my hand, lead me through this diseased land
I am tired, I am weak, I am worn
I have stole I have sinned, oh my soul is unclean
Country girl got to keep on keeping on, hey
You gotta keep on keeping on, you gotta keep on keeping strong
You gotta keep on keeping on when you got the riot city blues

One thing I have to say before I have to go 
Be careful with your seed, you will reap just what you sow
Oh yeah! What can a poor boy do? 
You better go back to your mama, she'll take care of you

Country girl take my hand, lead me through this diseased land
I am tired, I am weak, I am worn
I have stole I have sinned, oh my soul is unclean
Country girl got to keep on keeping on
Country girl got to keep on keeping on
