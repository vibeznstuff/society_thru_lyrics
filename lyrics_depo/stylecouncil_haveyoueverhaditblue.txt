Have you ever chased the night that sailed in front of you
On a boat that's bound for hope - But left you in the queue
With your shouting, waving, taunting, flaunting friends as crew
Telling you that every lie you ever heard was true
Have you stood upon that deck - Have you ever had it blue.

Have you ever woke to find the morning didn't come
Undelivered with the papers - stolen by someone
Found the milkman bound and gagged and shackles 'round the sun
And the holder of the keys turns out to be the one
The girl you had your heart set on - Have you ever had it blue.

Have you ever watched the day, passing by your door
Powerless to change its course, your feet fixed to the floor
When all the people you thought you knew are changing more and more
Even the girl you thought would see, seems only to ignore
The only love worth fighting for - Have you ever had it blue
