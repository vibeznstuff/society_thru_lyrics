You got up, you felt you should
I keep trying to myself I would've done the same had I could
I never thought that you would
But we became the eye of a storm, you took off from that outbound platform

And you went east 'cause it's easy
Don't mind if you leave me as long as you come back home
So I went south to define me and someday you'll find me
No different than I was before

Until then I'm still looking for you in every dark four door
Until then I'm still looking for you in every dark four door

I don't sleep enough at night
Imagining your silhouette I draw the outline of you in my mind

Since you went east 'cause it's easy
Don't mind if you leave me as long as you come back home
So I went south to define me and someday you'll find me
No different than I was before

Until then I'm still looking for you in every dark four door
Until then I'm still looking for you in every dark four door

Until then I'm still looking for you in every dark four door
Until then I'm still looking for you in every dark four door
Until then I'm still looking for you in every dark four door
Until then I'm still looking for you in every dark four door
