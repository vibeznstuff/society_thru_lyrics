I’ve been wasting all my time on you
We were just young, something we outgrew.

Should I be on my way? Eliminate the games we play.
Should I be on my way back home?
Should I be on my way? You’re leading me astray.
Should I be on my way back home?

I want you to know that I want you, you know that
I want you to know that I want you, you know that
I want you to know that I want you, you know that
I want you to know that I want you, you know that

Changing faces always out of blue
We’ve been talking but talking’s all we do.

Should I be on my way?! Eliminate the games we play.
Should I be on my way back home?
Should I be on my way? You’re leading me astray.
Should I be on my way back home?

I want you to know that I want you, you know that
I want you to know that I want you, you know that
I want you to know that I want you, you know that
I want you to know that I want you, you know that

Oooh-Ooh.Oooh-Ooh.Oooh-Ooh.
I want you to know that, Oooh-Ooh,
I want you. You know that.

You speak in tongues
I filled my lungs
With doubt unspoken
I buy my time, you cast a line
And my heart opens.

I want you to know that I want you. You know that.
I want you to know that I want you. You know that.
I want you to know that I want you. You know that.
I want you to know that I want you.

Oooh-Ooh-Oh. Oooh-Ooh. Oooh-Ooh-Oh.
Let me know or let me go.
Oooh-Ooh-Oh.
Let me know.
Oooh-Ooh-Oh.
Let me know (I want you to know that) or let me go. Oooh-Ooh-Oh.
Let me know (I want you. You know that.)
Oooh-Ooh-Oh.
Let me know (I want you to know that) or let me go. Oooh-Ooh-Oh.
Let me know (I want you. You know that.)
