Desolate loving in yor eyes
You used to made my life so sweet
Step out like a god found child
I saw your eyes across the street
Who would be the fool to take you
Be more than just kind
Step into a life of maybe
Love is hard to find
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
Whatch me clinging to the beat
I had to fight to make it mine
That religion you coul sink it neat
Just move your feet and you'll feel fine
Who would be the fool to maybe
Trick a kiss in time
Who am I to say that's crazy
Love will make you blind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
