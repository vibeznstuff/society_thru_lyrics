Didn't I make you feel
Like you were the only one?
And didn't I give you everything I could
Well didn't I get it to you now, baby?

After all the love I gave you
There was never enough
Well I'm gonna show ya baby
That this man can get tough

Just come on, come on, come on, come on
And (take a)
Take another little piece of my heart now baby 
(Oh, break a)
Break another little piece of my heart and throw it away
(Oh, take a)
Take another little piece of my heart now baby 
You know you got it 
If it makes you feel good, oh yeah

Out there in the streets lookin' good
And in your heart ya know it ain't right, it just ain't right
Yeah, and ya never, never, never, never hear me
When I cry all night 

I keep tryin' to tell myself that I 
Can't stand the pain 
But then ya hold me in your arms, ooh baby 
And I gotta say it again

Just come on, (come on), yeah come on, (come on)
(Take a)
Take another little piece of my heart now baby 
(Oh, break a)
Break another little piece off, and just throw it away
(Oh, take a)
Take another little piece of my heart now baby 
(Ooh) You know you got it 
If it makes you feel good

Oh, just come on, (come on), come on, (come on)
(Take a) Take it baby
Just break my heart again
I don't need it, I don't want it
You can take it, take it, baby
You know you got it
If it makes you feel good

Just (come on), oh yeah, (come on)
(Take a)
Take another little piece of my heart now baby 
(Oh, break a)
Break another little piece off and throw it away
(Oh, take a)
Yeah, another little piece of my heart now baby 
(Oh, break a)
Take it and break it, take it, take it and break it baby
(Oh, take a)
Another little piece of my heart now baby 
(Oh, break a)
Just take a piece and break it off and just throw it away
(Oh, take a)
I don't need it, I never needed it anyway
(Oh, break a)
Take it, break it
