Stand by here we go again 
Jus you let me wait let me know again 
Ain't nobody special girl I'm jus a friend 
I bet you cant recall my name 
I think about you everyday 
24/7 girl in every way 
Try to move on but what can I say 
No-one else can take your place 


I guess I done this when I should have done that 
I tried to be smart but I want you so bad 
Have you ever needed what you've never ever had 
I jus cant get enough enough enough 
Jus when it looks like I'm gonna get close 
My lips mess up and my words don't flow
I jus cant wait till we freaking more frequently baby
Coz I cant get enough enough enough

Oh no I should have spoke up 
See whats goin on now I'm choke up 
Like I was sleeping and should have woke up 
I ain't gon' let it end like this 
Word of town says you broke up 
You been around and keep your hopes up 
I'll be around and baby know what 
I'm bringing what you can't resist 

 
I guess I done this when I should have done that 
I tried to be smart but I want you so bad 
Have you ever needed what you've never ever had 
I jus cant get enough enough enough 
Jus when it looks like I'm gonna get close 
My lips mess up and my words don't flow
I jus cant wait till we freaking more frequently baby
Coz I cant get enough enough enough
