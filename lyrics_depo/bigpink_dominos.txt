These girls fall like dominos, dominos 

As soon as I love her it's been too long
Talks of future with you caves me in
Swallow my sugar kiss and eat it alone
Hearts collide, smash any dreams of love.

These girls fall like dominos, dominos 

Three words we shared said too early on
Start with forever to the point of tears
Swimming with a fear where we slowly drown
Ending at never arching melody

As soon as I love her it's been too long
And I really love breaking your heart
These silver apples will shine on, I was wrong
The hottest love has the coldest end.

These girls fall like dominos, dominos
