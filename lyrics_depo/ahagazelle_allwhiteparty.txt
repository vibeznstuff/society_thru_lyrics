It's Aha man

Last summer I learned how to drive two cars
At the same time throwing gang signs out the window
And this was all from the back seat

Relaxing
My bad I'm just really good at multitasking
I put both cars in park like Jurassic
While eating on a two piece from Southern Classic
Ask me how I feel, I'ma say fantastic
I'm in God's will like my little cousin Ashley

It's a celebration, gold chains swinging
Switched it up to all white, you can't call me racist
I did it with my eyes closed like I'm meditating
Okay I'm just playing, really I was praying
Cooking like a cater
It's up like Himalayas
A breath of fresh air maneuver like I'm respiration
And if I fall down I throw a party in the basement
I just do it like a demonstration

Last summer I learned how to drive two cars
At the same time throwing gang signs out the window
And this was all from the back seat

Eating lunch, 808's beating like a body in the trunk
God got my back so I ain't even gotta front
I'm in the back seat, I ain't even in the front
You know I have to raise the bar like a Nestlé Crunch
I'm not a blood but it's early so I guess its brunch
Had to be careful while I'm driving not to hit a bump
Cause I got all this white on and I'm drinking punch
I used to have a white boss named Mr. Randy
Now I wear all white just to feel immaculate
Black boy in all white looking like he ashy
I keep a pair of Nike Airs like I'm asthmatic

It's a celebration gold chain swinging
I switch it up to all white you can't call me racist
I did it with my eyes closed like I'm meditating
Ok I'm just playing, really I was praying
Cooking like a cater
It's up like Himalayas
A breath of fresh air maneuver like I'm respiration
And if I fall down I throw a party in the basement
I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just

Last summer I learned how to drive two cars
At the same time throwing gang signs out the window
And this was all from the back seat

Feeling like a has been
'Cause wouldn't nobody have me
Ima drive this car by myself
Ima go real far by myself
Even if I run out of gas
Ima be a star by myself
But you'll never be bigger than the sun
Earth spins but there's more to life than selling CD's roms
Pull up leaning out the window throwing up where I'm from
Ask me what I think I'm doing
I'ma answer like I'm dumb
If you don't mind your beeswax
You prolly gonna get stung
Just because I got a Bible don't mean I ain't got a gun
Ain't nobody asked to give a hand until I got it done
Now they running trying to be up on my side just like a thumb
Man the way they run behind me you would think I'm Forrest Gump
And you tell me be myself but that ain't what you really want
Man I just want to feel love like Barney
Not surprised it wasn't real that's what I expect from a Barbie
I'm in the shower trying to wipe off this sauce all on me
Look at me, am I clean enough for your all white party?
I got a hot verse that I rehearse sitting on the stove
To go along with some hot beats like some stolen Dr. Dre headphones
I'll rap to you for a piece of paper
Don't rap me up in your litigation
I deserve my invitation
I'm free like emancipation

Last summer I learned how to drive two cars
At the same time throwing gang signs out the window
And this was all from the roof of the car
I'm marching living bulletproof so I can shoot for the stars
But you'll never be bigger than the Son
(Too high, too high, too high)
But you'll never be bigger than the Son
Yeah yeah, yeah Jesus
