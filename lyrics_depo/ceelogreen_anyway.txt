I know I'm stingy with my money
And it's hard to get some from me
But you still love me anyway
Your mother seems to like me
But your father wants to fight me
But you still love me anyway
And I take you out on dates
And I always show up late
But you still love me anyway
There's no one else like this
That would put up with my shit
And still love me anyway


Because no matter what I do
I know I can count on you
'Cause baby, you still love me anyway
For worse or for better
You make me better
I know you still love me anyway
Because no matter what I do
I know I can count on you
Cause baby you still love me anyway
For worse or for better
You make me better
I know you still love me anyway

I only see you every now and then
And I'm on the road again
But you still love me anyway
And when this relationship's not working
That's when all your friends start flirting
And my eyes may wander but that is not ok
So I make it up to you
With a brand new pair of shoes
If you still love me anyway
And I will surely miss the way you put up my shit
I'll make it up to you some day


Cause no matter what I do
I know I can count on you
Cause baby you still love me anyway
For worse or for better
You make me better
I know you still love me anyway

You still love me anyway
You still love me any, still love me any
Still love me anyway
You still love me any, still love me any
Still love me anyway
You still love me any, still love me any
Still love me anyway


I said... mmm, mmm

No one loves me quite like you do girl
It's unconditional, unconditional


Cause no matter what I do
I know I can count on you
Cause baby you still love me anyway
For worse or for better
You make me better
I know you still love me anyway

You still love me anyway
You still love me any, still love me any
Still love me anyway
You still love me any, still love me any
Still love me any
Still love me anyway
