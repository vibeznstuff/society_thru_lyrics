Oh baby let it rain
I feel it washing over me
The anxiety
I watch it fade away

Coz everything can change
It changes right in front of me
Could you set me free
To where I wanna be


Is something wrong, is there a reason why
We're puting up a fight
Don't be ashamed to open up your heart
Everybody cries

Goodbye is kinda hard
It's not a thing I like to do
Can you pull me through
Into a better day

Forever in my heart
You'll always be a part of me
You believed in me
And that I won't forget



I look above and search into the sky
To help me make it right
And now you're gone, well what am I to do
Everybody cries

No-one
Should ever be lonely
And we were meant to walk together
Together (together, together - yeah)
