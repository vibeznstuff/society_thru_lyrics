Which of the witches do you belong?
The one with the eye patch or the one who's highly strung
I know you can't trust anyone
How do you capture a photograph?
Put it to sleep pretend you're having a laugh
I know you thought you'd have the last

I'm a fire and I'll burn burn burn tonight
I'm a fire and I'll burn burn burn tonight
I'm a fire and I'll burn burn burn tonight
I'm a fire and I'll burn burn burn tonight

The midget is frigid I put it to you
Who's got a match I've got the petrol to set it too
I know I shouldn't have trusted you
It's making me tense when you're telling me
It's just the facts that don't compute the classic way
I guess I'm wrong again anyway

I'm a fire and I'll burn burn burn tonight
I'm a fire and I'll burn burn burn tonight
I'm a fire and I'll burn burn burn tonight
I'm a fire and I'll burn burn burn tonight

I'm a fire and I'll burn tonight
I'm a fire
I'm a fire and I'll burn tonight
I'm a fire

I'm a fire and I'll burn burn
I'm a fire and I'll burn burn
I'm a fire and I'll burn burn
I'm a fire and I'll burn burn
I'm a fire and I'll burn burn
I'm a fire and I'll burn burn
I'm a fire
I'm a fire
I'm a fire.
