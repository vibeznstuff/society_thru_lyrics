Tell the creatures just to beat it now

Yessir
Ass everywhere
Throw them dollars in the air
Bring you swimming gear
Juicy J the millionaire
She pop that pussy on me
I fell back in the chair
Bands a make her dance
Molly make her lose them underwear
Booty cheeks, I'm geeked (you know it)
All her friends are freaks (you know it)
And I think she love me
I've been hitting it for a week (swish)
I drill it, slap it silly
Need a super freak like Ricky
I'm Rick James bitch
I slip myself a Mickey
Got so much money in my pocket
With a real bad chick from the tropics
With silicone racks with a real big ass
Make her bounce it like hydraulics
Kept it hard, I got purple on the plane (we smoking)
Let's call a bull (let's go),
Let's run a train (trippy)
