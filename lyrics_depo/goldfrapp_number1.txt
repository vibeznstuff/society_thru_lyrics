Walk out into velvet
Nothing more to say
You're my favourite moment
You're my Saturday

Cos you're my number one
I'm like a dog to get you
I want it up and on
I'm like a dog to get you
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh

Sunset only seconds
Just ripe then it's gone
Got no new intentions
Just right then it's gone

Cos you're my number one
I'm like a dog to get you
I want it up and on
I'm like a dog to get you
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh

I'll be there to meet you
Getting down to greet you

Walk out into velvet
Nothing more to say
You're my favourite moment
You're my Saturday

Cos you're my number one
I'm like a dog to get you
I want it up and on
I'm like a dog to get you
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh

Cos you're my number one
I'm like a dog to get you
I want it up and on
I'm like a dog to get you
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh

Howl under the moon
Howl under the moon
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
Howl under the moon
Howl under the moon
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
