(Ooh)
mmm... the greatest day, yeah
Gonna tell you
(ah ooh oooh)
Ooh yeah
Feelin' good now

It's a good thing the air feels cool today
And it's better that God don't send the rain
And it's best if heaven holds back the clouds
'Cos inside of me there's fire untamed

See, everyday I find a four leaf clover
Everyday Lady Luck is at my door
And all of the fear I fight is in remission
To come around no more

And I'm feelin' good (oh really)
Never better (never better)
In fact, it's the greatest day of my life (the greatest day, the greatest day)
And I'm feelin' good (so good)
Never better (never better)
In fact, it's the greatest day of my life

It's a good thing your heater broke down today
And it's better you keep them drinks on ice
And it's best if you got them chills down in your soul (ooh)
'Cos the heat inside of me will surely suffice, yeah

And none of the world's restraints could ever hold me
And none of the superficial could tie me down
And none of the pain I felt is enough to break me
See my face was never made to cry

And I'm feelin' good (so good)
Never better (never better)
In fact, it's the greatest day of my life (mmm the greatest day, the greatest day)
And I'm feelin' good (alright)
Never better (never better)
In fact, it's the greatest day of my life

Ow hey-hey yeah
The greatest day
Come in The sun is shining out
It's all good in my hood yeah
Everybody happy
Sun smilin'
So someone tell me what the day is today

Greatest day
And I'm feelin' good (ooh ooh yeah)
Never better (never better, no)
In fact, it's the greatest day of my life (ooh it's the greatest day)
And I'm feelin' good (hey hey)
Never better (never better, no)
In fact, it's the greatest day of my life (whoah-whoah greatest day, greatest day)

And I'm feelin' good (ooh ooh yeah)
Never better (mmm, never better, no, no)
In fact, it's the greatest day of my life (ooh it's the greatest day of my life)
And I'm feelin' good (hey hey)
