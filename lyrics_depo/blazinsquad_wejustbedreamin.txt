Close my eyes an' I'm there again 
we got girls, girls, weed, smoke in the air again We dreamin, We jus' be dreemin
N' now we're livin in the sunshine 


Close my eyes and I dream for a minute 
The place I had dreamt had us all in it 
Hittin girls up two at a time and we'll be livin in the sunshine
This girl was lookin at me 
She had long brown hair 
about 6 - 3 
Girl - you're too tall for me 
So baby - go try your luck with Kenzie 

Sippin' on gin n juice in the shade 
Girls around my side cuz I just got paid 
I got a right to blaze it 
Bumped by the caseload 
Eating strawberries off of her navel 




Let me tell you about a dream of mine
We were all laid back in the sunshine 
We dreamin - girls just be screamin
I dont think its my time to leave and 
I aint coming down for days 
I'm feeling so good in so many ways 
Feeling so crazy - chilling with the beautiful ladies 



Yo - me n the boys are here 
What you know about us? 
How we roll in the summer 
How we blaze bunnin it up 
runnin the beats, sunnin the streets
winnin the cup luvin the heat 
comin from me- its picking me up


It's the holidays 
Girls in the park - it's a lovely day 
Baby mommas chillin with their friends 
watch their babies play, past summers flash bk
like they were yesterday,betta dayz
blud chill blaze the day away


summertime hot girls theres a lot a lot to play
in these dayz the summer, if ur a buuner its funner
coz u jus sit there and wonder
sittin under sun, all the girls and boyz come together as one
