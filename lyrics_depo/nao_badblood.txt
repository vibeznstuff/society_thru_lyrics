You're a holiday
A glass of ocean slipping down my throat
And landed on my hopes, I'm dreaming
Off the maps no hidden grids, I'm fleeing
I worship you like holy days
Lying on my back, seeing clouds and rays
Drinking lime and bitter from my lemonade
White horses, merry time won't do
Oh, ooh
Oh, ooh
Oh, ooh
Oh, ooh
Oh, ooh
Oh, ooh

Do you remember the holiday
Slipped away
Time and place
I definitely remember
Lying on my back and seeing
Clouds and rays
We're dreaming
The feelings rule
Forever we're young
Pages unsung
Ooh
I feel that you remember
Dreaming of a past that couldn't last
But now we're changing, refraining

I think it is the, know that it's the
I think it is the bad, bad blood
I think it is the, know that it's the
I think it is the bad, bad blood

Do you remember the riding, the passion
The falling over, tripping on ice
Sharing advice, taking it twice
But let us not forget the
Silent day, stripped away
Time and place
Oh, you choose not to remember
Fly away, counting days
I'm hiding from you, ooh

I think it is the, know that it's the
I think it is the bad, bad blood
I think it is the, know that it's the
I think it is the bad, bad blood

I choose
For the rain not to fall
Exposing the sun on you
I lose
Don't tell me I'm goo-goo, I know
And it's mad, we were close, oh
I choose
My head's now afloat
But my heart's drowning pulse of you
I lose
Don't tell me I'm coo-coo
Coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-ooh-ooh

I think it is the, know that it's the
I think it is the bad, bad blood
I think it is the, know that it's the
I think it is the bad, bad blood
I think it is the, know that it's the
I think it is the bad, bad blood
I think it is the, know that it's the
I think it is the bad, bad
