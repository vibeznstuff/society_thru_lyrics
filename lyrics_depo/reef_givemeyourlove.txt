Underneath me you are melting
Soon enough you will be shouting
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
It's all we need

Seems there is no other way now
We've been gone for many days now
Gimme your love

Gimme your love
Gimme a love that's sweet as... oh yeah

Til our last breath we will love dear
I have time for nothing else here
Gimme your love

Gimme a love that's sweet as... oh yeah oh yeah

What do you say to, one of you please get out?
One of you got to, one of you got to
