Steppin' out from underneath my shadow
Walking home from fridays nine to five
Rememberin' the long way round the meadow
The one we used to take from time to time

I thought about you
How you must have changed now baby
Far away from me
How I used to savour all your kisses
Where no one else could see

Exchanging knowing glances across the schoolroom
Dreamin' of a love down by the sea
Changing plans to cover up for one another
Working on our secret fantasy

But now as I walk down the road to your house baby
There's no one there but me
How I wish that I could steal your kisses
Just as they used to be
And I wanna know

Tracie, where are you now girl
I don't know why this feeling's so strong
Tracie, where have you been
You know there's no one now to tell us we're wrong

Countin' by the street lights to the phone box
Where we used to meet before the dawn
Smoking on the top floor of the school bus
Promising the moon as we rode along

But now if I saw you across a crowded dance floor
Or somewhere in the town
Would you show me what I have been missing
And spin me round and round

Tracie, where are you now girl
I don't know why this feeling's so strong
Tracie, where have you been
You know there's no one now to tell us we're wrong

'cause deep inside from some other place
I turn to find we're there face to face
We laugh, we cry, we work and we play
As love filled night gives way to the day
