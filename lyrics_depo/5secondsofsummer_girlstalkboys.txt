When the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys
Oh when the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys

Hey!

When you're talking to your girls, do you talk about me?
Do you say that I'm a sweetheart? Do you say that I'm a freak?
Do you tell them white lies? Do you tell them the truth?
Do you tell them that you love me, the way that I've been loving you?

Cause every night you and I find ourselves
Kissing and touching like no one else
Falling and falling until I fell,
For you

Cause I've been talking to my friends
The way you take away my breath
It's something bigger than myself,
It's something I don't understand, no, no
I know we're young and people change,
And we may never feel the same,
So baby tell me what you say

When the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys
(I can hear 'em talking)
Oh when the girls (when the girls), when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys

Hey!

When you're talking to your girls, do you talk about me?
Do you tell them I'm your lover? That I'm all that you need?
Do you tell them white lies? Do you tell them the truth?
Do you tell them that you love me, the way that I've been loving you?

Cause every night you and I find ourselves
Kissing and touching like no one else
Falling and falling until I fell,
For you

Cause I've been talking to my friends,
The way you take away my breath
It's something bigger than myself,
It's something I don't understand, no, no
I know we're young and people change,
And we may never feel the same,
So baby tell me what you say

When the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys
(I can hear 'em talking)
Oh when the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys

When the girls talk boys
Talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk
When the girls talk boys (when the girls)
Talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk

Hey!
