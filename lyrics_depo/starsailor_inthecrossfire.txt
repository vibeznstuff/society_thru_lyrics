I don't see myself when I look in the mirror
I see who I should be
I don't see myself when I look in your eyes
Thank God for that

I don't see myself when I look cross the river
I see where I should be
I don't see myself when I look from the sky
Thank God for that
I hear them screaming 
On the radio
Its getting louder
In the crossfire
Trying to find some hope
From the ashes of their broken homes

I don't see myself when they fail to deliver
I see what I should be
I don't see myself when I look at the flag
Thank God for that

I hear them screaming 
On the radio
It's getting louder
In the crossfire
Trying to find some hope

Our day will come
We'll find the sun
We'll find the fire 
We'll sanctify
The love we gave
Our one desire

I hear them screaming 
On the radio
Its getting louder
In the crossfire
Trying to find some hope
I hear them screaming 
On the radio
Its getting louder
In the crossfire
Trying to find some hope
From the ashes of their broken homes

I don't see myself when I look in the mirror
