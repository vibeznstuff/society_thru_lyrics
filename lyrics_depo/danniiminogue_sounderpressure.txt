I'm So Under Pressure (pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure)

Trippin' on intensity
I'm weighed down by gravity
And I'm waitin' to exhale

I'm So Under Pressure (pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure)

Slippin' down and back again
When I want the pain to end
And I'm sinkin' in quick sand

I'm So Under Pressure
(yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
I'm So Under Pressure

I'm gonna shout
It's a blow out
Again and, again and, again

I'm So Under Pressure
(yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
I'm So Under Pressure (yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
(yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
(yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Get A Grip
(yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
(yeah yeah)

Get a grip I'm almost gone
There's just too much going on
Feel like I can hardly breathe
(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)

I'm So Under Pressure
(yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
I'm So Under Pressure (yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

And I wanna get out
Cos it's gonna blow out
I just wanna get out
Cos it's gonna blow out (yeah yeah)

And I wanna get out (I'm So Under Pressure)
Cos it's gonna blow out
I Just wanna get out
Cos it's gonna blow out

And I wanna get out (I'm So Under Pressure)
Cos it's gonna blow out
I just wanna get out (yeah yeah)
Cos it's gonna blow out (yeah yeah)

And I wanna get out (I'm So Under Pressure)
Cos it's gonna blow out
I just wanna get out (yeah yeah)
Cos it's gonna blow out (yeah yeah)

And I wanna get out (I'm So Under Pressure)
Cos it's gonna blow out
