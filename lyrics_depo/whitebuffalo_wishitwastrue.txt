Mother, try to do right by you
To do what you asked me to
I did wrong and I knew

Mother I tried to behave for you
Now I'm a digging a grave for you
It was all I could do

Find a way back home, make everything new
But I wish it was true

Father, well I gave my soul to you
I came in blind folded for you
It was all that I knew

Open your arms and I'll fly out of hell up to you
I wish it was true

Boy come on out from the cold
Your lost outside there don't you know
It's not what you say it's what you do
Just keep wishing your wishes are true
Well your dreams they're reality
There's no pain there's no misery
Just polish the blood and the bruise
For there's just no way you can lose
But I wish it was true

Country, I was a soldier for you
I did what you asked me to
It was wrong and you knew

Country, now I'm just a stranger to you
A number a name it's true
Throw me away when you're through

Home of the brave and the free the red white and blue
But I wish it was true
