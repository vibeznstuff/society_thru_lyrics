I've had nights i will never forget
I've had nights i will always regret
but i can take it on the chin,
and say "Boys Will Be Boys"

There's been girls that have stolen our hearts,
but the others said they couldn't be prised apart
whoever let's us in they say "Boys Will Be Boys"

Well it's under my skin so i can never win,
so thanks a lot
we cheat and we lie and we fight 
we don't cry while we try

I felt driven and i felt obliged,
I've had feelings like a thorn in my side,
I hope you never let this down now, "Boys Will Be Boys"

But if i saw her i could hardly restrain
every worked girl to labour with me,
chin up, chin up,
"Boys Will Be Boys"

And mi say,
you better move out the way
we comfortin' the people them rockin' and swayin'
when serious, I never ever play,
Boys will be Boys and there's nuttin' you can say
Spread the word i cross the land
cross wit me people understand
wish i had a magic wand 
so make people unite nicely as one,
this goes out to all mi gals and e'one,
Boys will be Boys we'll surviv till the end,
whooaaaa....

Well it's under my skin so i can never win,
oh thanks a lot
we cheat and we lie and we fight 
we don't cry while we try

"Boys Will Be Boys"
