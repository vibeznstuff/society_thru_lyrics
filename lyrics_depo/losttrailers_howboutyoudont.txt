All of this screamin ain't gettin us nowhere tonight
You're dead set on leavin, both of us tired of the same old fight
Your drawers are empty, your closet too
Your lips are ready to say were through

But how about you don't slam that door
Call it quits, throw your suitcase in that old Ford
Back the car out, make that right, hit the highway
Say goodbye, how about you don't

I wanna be a changed man, yeah, I'm gonna do the right thing now
I know I lose my temper, thats when everything goes south
But you do too, you know its true but walking out ain't the thing to do

So how about you don't slam that door
Call it quits, throw your suitcase in that old Ford
Back the car out, make that right, hit the highway, say goodbye
How about you don't

Please don't say that its over

How about you don't, don't even move
Let me hold you, show you that I still love you
Lets just try one more time, there ain't no good in saying goodbye
So how about you don't, so how about you don't
How about you don't
