Destiny turned her face
Nightmares and violent shapes
The state of dreaming
Has left me numb

Blue eyes and wandering lips
True lies through fingertips
Hidden tales of forbidden
Love

You've left me miserable
Miserable
Miserable
Mis-er-a-ble

Love

You've left me miserable
Miserable
Miserable
Mis-er-a-ble

Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking

Visions of better times
Kingdoms and lilac wine
Why did God fail
To improve us

Teardrops of acid rain
Burning down through my veins
Can't I just sleep for a night?

Now
Despite my fears
I danced for you
Even while others knew

When can one wake and live again?
I'm desperate
Desperate

Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking

Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
(Now despite my fears I danced for you)
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
(When can one wake and live again)
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
