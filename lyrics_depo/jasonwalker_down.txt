I don't know where I'm at
I'm standing at the back
And I'm tired of waiting
Waiting here in line, hoping that I'll find what I've been chasing

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try, I know I'm gonna fall down
I thought I could fly, so why did I drown?
I never know why it's coming down, down, down

Not ready to let go
Cause then I'd never know
What I could be missing
But I'm missing way too much
So when do I give up, what I've been wishing for

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try, I know I'm gonna fall down
I thought I could fly, so why did I drown?
I never know why it's coming down, down, down
Oh I am going down, down, down
I can't find another way around
And I don't want to hear that sound, of losing what I never found

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try, I know I'm gonna fall down
I thought I could fly, so why did I drown?
I'll never know why it's coming down, down, down

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try, I know I'm gonna fall down
I thought I could fly, so why did I drown?
Oh, it's coming down, down, down
