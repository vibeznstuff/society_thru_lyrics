Not a word from your lips
You just took for granted that I want to skinny dip
A quick hit, that's your game
But I'm not a piece of meat, simulate my brain, no

The night is young, so are we
Let's just get to know each other slow and easily, oh, oh
Take my hand, let's hit the floor
Shake our bodies to the music
Maybe then you'll score, oh, oh

So come on baby, won't you show some class
Why'd you have to move so fast?

We don't have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh, no
We could dance and party all night
And drink some cherry wine, oh, oh

Just slow down if you want me
A man wants to be approached cool and romantically, oh, oh
I've got needs just like you
And if the conversation's good
Vibrations through and through, oh, oh

So come on baby, won't you show some class
Why'd you have to move so fast?


We don't have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, no, oh
We could dance and party all night
And drink some cherry wine, oh, oh


We don't have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh, oh
We could dance and party all night
And drink some cherry wine, oh, oh
