Reggae night, we come together when the feeling's right
Reggae night, and we'll be jammin 'till the morning light

Penny Reel just called, got to get my things, got to catch this ride
Gotta look my best because I know there'll be mashin' up tonight
Reggae night, we come together when the feeling's right
Reggae night, and we'll be jammin 'till the morning light

You will find it happens only once a year
So don't miss out on this session here

There'll be people comin' from the North and South and East and West
So you better look your best, man
Now, lightnin' strikes at 8, so you better not be late
For this rub-a-dubbin', rockin', jammin', fun, fun, lovin', yeah
Reggae night, we come together when the feeling's right,
Reggae night, and we'll be jammin 'till the morning light

You will find it happens only once a year
So take advantage of this festive cheer
Make we bring we family and let's tell some friends
And everyone will have a jam, jam, session

Oh oh oh raggae night, oh oh oh raggae night

Oh oh oh raggae night, oh oh oh raggae night
Reggae night, we come together when the feeling's right
Reggae night, and we'll be jammin 'till the morning light
