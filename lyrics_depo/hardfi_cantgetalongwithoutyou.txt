Well I walked out, cos I had some plans,
Yea I walked out, destiny in my own hands,
I thought I'd get by without you oh I,
Thought I'd survive without you

I got drunk, I did not know why,
I got drunk, I was dying inside,


Can't get along without you,
I can't get along without you,
I can't get along without you,
No something is wrong,
I can't get along without you.

I picked fights, with men twice my size,
I picked fights, they punched out my lights,
Took smack, so I could get high,
I got hooked, and I nearly died,

I slept rough, I lived on the streets,
Slept rough, newspaper for sheets



I got a train, and I headed home,
I got a train to the town I was born,
I went back, to the place where we'd meet,
I broke down and cried in the street,

Because I realized what I'd done wrong,
I fucked up I loved you all along

Can't get along without you,
I can't get along without you,
I can't get along without you,
girl, believe me baby,



I really need you baby!
