Cab fare to nowhere
Is what you are
A white line to an exit sign
Is what you are

All that I saw in you 
Now I see through

Don't shed a tear for me 
My life won't end without you
(Without you)
Long as the night will be 
The sun will rise without you

A locked door on a candy store
Is what you are
(Is what you are)
A slim chance in tight pants
Is what you are

All that I loved you for
I want it more

Don't shed a tear for me 
My life won't end without you
(Without you)
Long as the night will be 
The sun will rise without you

You ain't givin'
Well, I'm not takin'
I'm not missin'
What we ain't makin'

All that I saw in you
Now I see through

Don't shed a tear for me 
My life won't end without you
(Without you)
Long as the night will be 
The sun will rise without you

Don't shed a tear for me 
My life won't end without you
(Without you)
Long as the night will be 
The sun will rise without you

(Is what you are)
I won't, don't shed no tears
I won't need, I don't need
I don't need
Oh, please
