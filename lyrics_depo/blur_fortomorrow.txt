(JIM STOPS AND GETS OU THE CAR, GOES TO A HOUSE IN EMPERORS GATE,
THROUGH THE DOOR AND TO HIS RROM, THEN HE PUTS THE TV ON, TURNS
IT OFF AND MAKES SOME TEA, SAYS MODERN LIFE IT'S RUBBISH, THEN
SUSAN COMES INTO THE ROOM, SHE'S A NAUGHT GIRL WITH A LOVELY
SMILE AND SAYS LET'S TAKE A DRIVE TO PRIMROSE HILL IT'S WINDY

LIKE ANYONE I SUPPOSE)
