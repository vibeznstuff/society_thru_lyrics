Going loco down in Acapulco if you stay too long
Yes you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

Feel the pressure your back's against the wall
Love is gaining on you you're just about to fall
If you're afraid to love afraid to take a chance
You better hide your feelings get out while you can

'Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

You can hear voices bleeding through those warm Latin nights
Memories are lost and found
Leaving broken hearts all over town

'Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

You'll be pulling out your hair drowning in despair
With a whole lot of nothing on your way to nowhere
Your search for paradise will come to an end
When you realize what a fool you've been

You'll be haunted by her face
Missing her warm embrace
Memories of loving her
Holding her tight every night
Was that the best part of your life?
Hearing her voice soft and low
Begging you to please
Please don't go
Don't go
No! Don't go! Don't go!

You can hear voices bleeding through those warm Latin nights
Memories are lost and found
Leaving broken hearts all over town, all over town

'Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

Going loco down in Acapulco if you stay too long
Yes you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

Going loco down in Acapulco if you stay too long
Yes you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong
