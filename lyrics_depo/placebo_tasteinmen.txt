Come back to me awhile
Change your style again
Come back to me awhile
Change your taste in men
It's been this way since Christmas Day
Dazzled, doused in gin
Change your taste in men
Come back to me awhile
Change your style again
Come back to me awhile
Change your taste in men
I'm killing time on Valentine's
Waiting for the day to end
Change your taste in men

Come back to me awhile
Change your style again
Come back to me awhile
Change your taste in men
It's been this way since Christmas Day
Dazzled, doused in gin
Change your taste in men
