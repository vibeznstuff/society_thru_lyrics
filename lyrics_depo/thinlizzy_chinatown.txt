Living and dying
In chinatown
Yes they're living and dying down in old chinatown
In chinatown
You better look around
Man, you don't stand a chance if you go down in chinatown
Man, you don't stand a chance if you go down in chinatown

Laughing and crying you know it's a fact
They're not laughing they are crying
'Cause they won't be back
Oh no you don't come back
Not from chinatown
Man, you don't stand a chance if you go down in chinatown
Man, you don't stand a chance if you go down in chinatown

Chinatown, it's a different scene
There are people there, they are so obscene
If you see what I mean
Then they've sold you the dream
Down in chinatown
What goes up it must come down

Living and dying
There is no release
Living and dying
There is no relief
There is no beliefs
Not in chinatown
Man, you don't stand a chance if you go down in chinatown
Man, you don't stand a chance if you go down in chinatown
