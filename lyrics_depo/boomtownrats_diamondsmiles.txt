Traffic's wild tonight
Diamond smiles her cocktail smile.
Tonight she's in heavy disquise.
She looks at her wrist to clock the passing time.

Weather's mild tonight
She wonders do they notice her eyes,
She wonders will her glamour survive,
And can they see she's going down a third time.

Everybody tries,
It's Dale Carnegie gone wild,
But Barbara Cartland's child
Long ago perfected the motionless glide.

In the low voltage noise,
Diamond seems so sure and so poised
She shimmers for the bright young boys,
And laugh's "Love is for others, but me it destroys"

The girl in the cake
Jumped out too soon by mistake,
Somebody said the whole thing's half baked
And Diamond lifts her glass and says "cheers"

She stands to the side
There's no more to this than meets the eye,
Everybody drinks Martini dry,
And talks about clothes and the latest styles.

They said she did it
With grace.
They said she did it
With style.
They said she did it all
Before she died
Oh No
I remember Diamond's smile

Nobody saw her go,
They said they should have noticed 
'cos her dress was cut so low.
Well it only goes to show
Ha, ha, how many real men any of us know.

She went up the stairs,
Stood up on the vanity chair,
Tied her lame belt around the chandelier,
And went out kicking at the perfumed air.

They said she did it
With grace.
They said she did it
With style.
They said she did it all
Before she died
Oh No
I remember Diamond's smile
