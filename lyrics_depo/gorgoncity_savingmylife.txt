Saved my life, woah

Do you feel like a teardrop in the ocean?
Can you feel the dark force in the air?
Is it hard when you get up, and get back in the moment?
And you're not moving anywhere
Do they tell you "dream small and surrender
To what is easy and in the front of your face"?
If you're scared, you only doubt and you're never getting out
Then this is what you gotta say

I'm saving...
Saving my life

Are you stuck in a rat race that you won't win?
Are you scared that you'll never wake up?
Will they make you punch in, when you're there in the morning
And punch out when they've had enough?
Well, there's a life and it's out there for the taking
You can run and you can leave this behind
Tell you, it's a trap and they caught you in the act
Ain't nothing but a state of mind

I'm saving...
