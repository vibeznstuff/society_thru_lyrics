I don't wanna tell my parents, wanna tell my sister
You don't wanna tell your friends
You don't wanna pack your stuff
Fall back in love with another girl again
All alone, picking up take out
Coming home to an empty house
Admitin' that the time we spent
Was just a lesson

We've got all our reasons why
We try to justify
Sticking it out, to stay together
And we're supposed to last forever
You and I, too scared to say goodbye
But guess what will happen later
We're not doing us any favors

I'm so sick of living a lie
So screw all of our reasons why

We feel like roommates, standing at the same sink
We don't even kiss goodnight
I don't wanna be a quitter, don't wanna have to answer
When everybody asks me why
Giving all your t-shirts back
Putting all my stuff in bags
We were supposed to be married by the time we're 30
Braking up was scary

We've got all our reasons why
We try to justify
Sticking it out, to stay together
And we're supposed to last forever
You and I, too scared to say goodbye
But guess what will happen later
We're not doing us any favors

I'm so sick of living a lie
So screw all of our reasons why
Goodbye

I don't love you, you don't love me
It can be, it can be just that simple, baby
I don't love you, you don't love me
It can be, it should be just that simple, baby
I don't love you, you don't love me
It can be, it can be just that simple, baby
I don't love you, you don't love me
It can be, it should be just that simple, baby (yeah)

Reasons why
We try to justify (justify)
Sticking it out, to stay together
And we're supposed to last forever
You and I (you and I), too scared to say goodbye (goodbye)
Guess what will happen later
We're not doing us any favors

I'm so sick of living a lie
So screw all of our reasons why
