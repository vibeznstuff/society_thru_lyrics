I like it, I like it 
I like the way you run your fingers through my hair 
And I love the way you tickle my chin 
And I like the way you let me come in when your momma ain't there

I like it, I like it 
I like the words you say and all the things you do 
And I like the way you straighten my tie 
And I like the way you're winking your eye 
And I know I like you
You know I like you 

Do that again 
You're driving me insane 
Kiss me once more 
That's another thing I like you for 

I like it, I like it 
I like the funny feeling being here with you 
And I like it more with every day 
And I like it always hearing you say you're liking it too 
You're liking it too 

I'm asking you
What do you wanna do?
Do you agree, 
That the world was made for you and me?

I like it, I like it 
I like the funny feeling being here with you 
And I like it more with every day 
And I like it always hearing you say you're liking it too 
You're liking it too 

Whoa-oh I like it
Are you liking it too?
