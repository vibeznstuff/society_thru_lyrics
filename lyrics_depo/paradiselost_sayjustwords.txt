You get high, with your destructive instinct
You get high, with your corrosive instinct -
Where can I go, to escape your foul mind tricks
You're trying it more, but you will never break me
Cause you presume, the winner's you but that's not true

So say just words to me, unreal what your hate's providing
Say just words to me, your talk is always contradiction
Say just words to me, you won't feel the warmth of friends around you
You say just words to me, is it true that there's worth inside,
So say just words to me.

Your designs, all the worse from power craving
Your desires, only where there's fire burning,
I'll show you the way, a pleasure that's for the taking
You're trying it more, but you won't get satisfaction
Couse you presume the winner is you, but that's not true
So say just words to me.
