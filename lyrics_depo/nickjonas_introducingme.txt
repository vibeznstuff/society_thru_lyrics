I'm, I'm good at wasting time,
I think lyrics need to rhyme,
And you're not asking,
But I'm trying to grow a mustache.
I eat cheese, but only on pizza, please,
And, sometimes, on a homemade quesadilla.
Otherwise it smells like feet to me.
And I, I really like you when the moon looks like a toe nail.
And I love you when you say my name.


If you wanna know, here it goes.
Gonna tell you there's a part of me that shows,
If we're close, gonna let you see everything,
But remember that you asked for it.
I'll try to do my best to impress,
But it's easier to let you take a guess, at the rest,
But you wanna hear what lives in my brain, my heart,
Well, you asked for it
For your perusing,
At times confusing,
Slightly amusing...
Introducing me!

Do do do do do do do,
Do do do do do do do.
La da da da,
La da da da da da da, da.

I never trust a dog to watch my food.
And I like to use the word 'dude'
As a noun, or an adverb, or an adjective
And I, I never really been into cars.
I like really cool guitars
And superheroes
And cheques with lots of zeroes on 'em.

I love the sound of violins and making someone smile...


If you wanna know, here it goes.
Gonna tell you there's a part of me that shows,
If we're close, gonna let you see everything,
But remember that you asked for it.
I'll try to do my best to impress,
But it's easier to let you take a guess, at the rest,
But you wanna hear what lives in my brain, my heart,
Well, you asked for it
For your perusing,
At times confusing,
Possibly amusing...
Introducing me!

Well, you probably know more than you ever wanted to,
So be careful when you ask next time.


So, if you wanna know, here it goes.
Gonna tell you there's a part of me that shows,
If we're close, gonna let you see everything,
But remember that you asked for it.
I'll try to do my best to impress,
But it's easier to let you take a guess, at the rest,
But you wanna hear what lives in my brain, my heart,

Hopefully amusing...

Do do do do do do do,
Do do do do do do do.
Do do do do...
Introducing me!
