You know I really like it
I know I'll always be here
You know it makes my heart beat
You know I'm happy up here

World, what you got for me?
Just bring it on
What's it gonna be?
Are you ready for it?
People, what you got for me?
Just bring it on
What's it gonna be?
I'm ready for it

You know I really like it
I know I'll always be here

Whatever you do, whatever you say
Nothing can push the feeling away
It's here in my heart and it's here in my head
I feel like I'm part of a book I've read
And every page and every paper
Seems to be part of human nature
Sending me back down on memory lane
My favorite record is playing again

You know I really like it
I know I'll always be here
You know it makes my heart beat
