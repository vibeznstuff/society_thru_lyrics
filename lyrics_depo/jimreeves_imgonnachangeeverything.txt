Yeah, I'm gonna change everything
That holds a memory of you
Oh! Yeah.

I'm gonna start with the walls
Take the pictures off the walls 
And burn 'em
Move the chairs around
Take the window curtains down 
And burn 'em
Everything I see
Reminds me you were here
Yeah, I'm gonna change everything 
That holds a memory of you
Oh! Yeah.

The candlelabra set
You gave me on the night 
Of my birthday
The records that you bought
The hi-fi we loved to play
The decorating man 
Will come and rearrange them
Yeah, I'm gonna change everything 
That holds a memory of you
Oh! Yeah.

Take the carpet off the floor
Throw it out the door
It's filled with tears
Everything I find 
That brings you to my mind 
Must disappear
Every night I dream 
I'll dream of someone new
Yeah, I'm gonna change everything 
That holds a memory of you
Yeah, I'm gonna change everything 
That holds a memory of you
Oh! Yeah, Mmm.
Oh! Yeah, Mmm...
