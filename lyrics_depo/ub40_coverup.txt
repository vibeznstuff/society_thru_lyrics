Cover up
With loving protection
Guard your love
In every direction
Don't give up
For fear of rejection
Stand your ground and voice an objection


Run away my sister and brother
Be afraid of love when the lover
Tries to read the book by the cover
Wrapped up in the arms of another



Cover up prolonging the yearning
Just ahead the fires are burning
Swim for shore the tides are now turning
Love the ones you love with your learning



Look ahead the futures depending
On the brave to now start defending
Tell the world the message you're sending
We don't need an unhappy ending



Got to be safe if you want to be free
To sit in the shade of the family tree





Got to be safe if you want to be free
To sit in the shade of the family tree
