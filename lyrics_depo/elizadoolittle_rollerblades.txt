I know you say you're ready to change
But I need to get it down on paper
It's in your face you're ready to blame
The first guy in line to catch the train

I'll save your seat
'Cause you don't stand for what you preach

See you with a broken string, tell me what you really mean,
Do you know what you want?
While beating up on yesterday, I was on my rollerblades
Rolling on moving on

It's time to take the time to create
'Cause you're running late the doors are closing
So tip your hat and you might get back
Whatever you need is up ahead
This train won't stop for anybody to get off

See you with a broken string tell me what you really mean
Do you know what you want?
While beating up on yesterday, I was on my rollerblades
Rolling on moving on
See you with a broken string tell me what you really mean
Do you know what you want?
Do you know, oh no

We got to run with it
It will get better
And that leaves we're stuck together
Make your mind up
Know what you need to say before you shout at me
So take your seat 'cause standing only wears out feet

See you with a broken string, tell me what you really mean
Do you know what you want?
You're beating up on yesterday, I was on my rollerblades
Rolling on, moving on
See you with a broken string, tell me what you really mean
Do you know what you want?
Beating up on yesterday, I was on my rollerblades
Rolling on, moving on
Do you know what you want?
