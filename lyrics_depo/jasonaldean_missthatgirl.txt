I found her silver bracelet in my backseat
The night she left, it seems like yesterday
It's like I found a treasure when I held it
How could I have ever let her get away

I still got a faded picture on my rearview
It's almost like she's lookin' right at me
Somehow just like that, it all comes rushin' back
She's right here the way it used to be
Yeah

I miss that girl
Knowin' they'll never be another one like her, not like her
Kickin' myself for ever lettin' her slip out of my world
I just miss that girl

Way back then it felt like I had things together
Whenever she'd come smilin' through that door
But I've had one or two tonight
And it just makes me realize
That I ain't so together anymore

And why I miss that girl
Knowin' they'll never be another one like her, not like her
Kickin' myself for ever lettin' her slip out of my world
I just miss that girl 

Yeah, I miss that girl
Yeah

I miss that girl
Knowin' they'll never be another one like her, not like her
Kickin' myself for ever letting' her slip out of my world
I just miss that girl

I still miss that girl
