I'm sorry but did I never mention
I'm better off with you
'Cause now I think it's time that you understood
We're better off as two

And ever since we met we've never been too clear
All our insecurities turn up in all our fears
And how we've tried to make our problems disappear
Never searching hard enough to find only more tears

That's why we are bound
The reason we are joined
'Cause we are always trying to be strongest
At our weakest points

I'm sorry but did I never mention
I'm better off with you
'Cause now I think it's time that you understood
We're better off as two

I know it gets too much sometimes when we're both not in tune
Singing to a different song, breaking us both in two
Then we start again, all the mistakes that we've made
Now we work in harmony with notes that never stray

'Cause we are always trying to be strongest
At our weakest points, oh

I'm sorry but did I never mention
I'm better off with you
'Cause now I think it's time that you understood
We're better off as two

Limiting ourselves has never worked too well
Boundaries never kept but always making more but still
We have made it far in the space of time
Being on our own won't work so why not just be mine

I'm sorry but did I never mention
I'm better off with you
'Cause now I think it's time that you understood
We're better off as two

I'm sorry but did I never mention
I'm better off with you
'Cause now I think it's time that you understood
We're better off as two
