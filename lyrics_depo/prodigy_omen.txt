It's an omen
It's an omen

Now the writing's on a wall
It won't go away
It's an omen
You just run out of automation
Now, now

Now the writing's on a wall
It won't go away
It's an omen
You just run out of automation

Now the writing's on a wall
It won't go away
It's an omen
It's an omen
It's an omen

It's an omen
