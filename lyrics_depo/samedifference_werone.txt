I've followed my dreams as long as I remember.
No matter the pain, no matter the rain-fall.

Ohoo-ooo-ooh
the road has been so long. So uncertain.
Looking back at what we've done
Chasing devils on the run
it's a kind of emotion, second to none.
Reaching for the sun.

This is love! This is life!
This is good! This is great!
This is all that we've believed in!

All this time, all the tears
all the prayers, all these years
we've waited on this feeling

Together! together! Were coming undone.
Together! Together! Baby We R One!
Ooo-oh-oooh

Life can be so hard, when you feel lonely. Yeh!
Hiding the ache, you don't want to break-down.
No, no. No, noo-oh-oooh.

You can change it all, if you believe it.
Yeh, yeh-yeh.

Looking back at what we've done reaching for the sun.

This is love! This is life!
This is good! This is great!
This is all that we've believed in!
All this time, all the tears
all the prayers, all these years 
we've waited on this feeling
together! Together! Were coming undone.
Together! Together! It's only begun.
Together! Together! Baby, We R 1!
This is love! This is life!
This is good! This is great!
This is all that we've believed in!
All this time, all the tears
all the prayers, all these years 
we've waited on this feeling

Hold me now and never let me go.
Hold me now and let the whole world know.
We R One

Got to let this feeling grow,
Got to let this feeling grow.

Looking back at what we've done
Chasing devils on the run
it's a kind of emotion second to none
it's a kind of emotion, 
reaching for the sun
Ohhh - oooh - yeh. Ooohooohh woohooo.

This is love! This is life!
This is good! This is great!
This is all that we've believed in!

All this time, all the tears
all the prayers, all these years
we've waited on this feeling

together! together! Were coming undone.
together! together! We've only begun.
together! together! Baby, We R 1!
Ohhh - oooh 
Baby We Are One
