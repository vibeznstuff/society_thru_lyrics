Lay down your weapons, weapons for me
Lay down your weapons, weapons for me
If that means anything

Listen little man I done told you fuck the hype ting
I done told road life ain't what it might seem
Where I'm from we do wrong for the right green
But at a price can loose your life for some nice things
No nice dreams, just fiends and syrens
No lie you don't wanna hear the 9 scream
These cold nights got us slipping like an ice rink
My bro died, he got hit up like lighting
My road dawg killing me in prison with the lifers
Youngen listen can you vision where my mind is
This life's sick, the ends sorta like the fire
Friends turned snitch I know you heard about spider
I recommend you take a telling from me
Cause I've been in it from the start dawg it's hell in these streets
Once your in it then your in it ain't no settling beef
Lay down your weapons fuck rapping get your money and leave


Lay down your weapons, weapons for me
Lay down your weapons, weapons for me
If that means anything
Can we avoid war, search and destroy war learn what to live for
If that means anything
Lay down your weapons, weapons for me
If that means anything

You think this life looks fun well look a little closer
You just might find this life isn't what you hope for
The road side's a lie and the proofs in a court charge
The truth is you die or sit down no sofa
Prison living is an image you don't know dawg
Picture living in this prison and it's so dark
And when you listen you hear whispers from the cold draft
Looking in the mirror at a sinner with a broke heart
I know it's so hard
I hope it won't last
I know you're scarred and you just wanna get your dough fast
But you don't wanna end up dead or stuck behind bars
Time is of the essence and the present flies past
When the 9 spark mothers lose their baby boy
And die hard kids wanna play with toys
Listen to my voice, can you hear my pain
Before there isn't choice
