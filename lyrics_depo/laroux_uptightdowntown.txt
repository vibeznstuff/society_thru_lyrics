Streets are lined with people
People who want to move move move
How can all these people
Have so much to prove prove prove

Oh I can only ask myself
Oh where are you all going
And won't you take me with you to
Where all the sirens are blowing


Uptight downtown
All the blue lights fighting with the crowds
And oh I know the temperature is rising, is rising

Streets are lined with people
With nothing left to lose, lose, lose
When did all these people
Decide to change their shoes, shoes, shoes

Oh I can only ask myself
Oh where are you all going
And won't you take me with you to
Where all the sirens are blowing


Uptight downtown
All the blue lights fighting with the crowds
And oh I know the temperature is rising, is rising

(Uptight) 
Uptight downtown 

Why are we fighting
I don't understand
Oh but the temperature's rising tonight
