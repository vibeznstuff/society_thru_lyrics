With some girls it don't matter who you hang with 
With some girls it don't matter how you talk 
And some girls they are easy to be yourself with 
But the one girl that I want ain't easy to please with what I've got 

With some girls it don't matter where you're aiming 
With some girls it don't matter how you act 
And some girls they don't care what car you came in 
But the one girl that I want, she wants that one bit of geography I lack 

Yeah, she don't want me 'cos I'm not where it's at 

And some girls they will worry about reactions 
And some girls they don't give a damn for that 
But somehow I ain't ever in on the action 
'Cos the one girl I want, she wants that one little quality I lack 

Yeah, she don't want me 'cos I'm not where it's at 

I don't have my finger on the pulse of my generation 
I just got my hand on my heart, I know no better location

Yeah, she don't want me 'cos I'm not where it's at
No I'm not where it's at
