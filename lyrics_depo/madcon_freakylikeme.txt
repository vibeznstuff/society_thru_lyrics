Freaky like me, Freaky like me, Freaky like me - me me
Freaky like me, Freaky like me, Freaky like me - me me

It was early in the morning
I hit a shower runnin'
I almost got remamber who this girl might be

And then she came back,
I couldn't belive my eyes
This pretty young thang with her eyes on me

I know you like it when I put my hands like that
Whisper in you ear, tell me how you like that

Came Freaky-eakyless what I do rust
So come a little closer, come a little closer

No-one's gonna tell you to freaky like me, freaky like me
Freaky like freaky like me, freaky like me, freaky like me-
Me-me, No-one

No-one's gonna tell you to freaky like me, freaky like me
Freaky like freaky like me, freaky like me, freaky like me-
Me-me, No-one

I'm feeling up their tighs
I'm running out of course
I had my kitty "Urr" as she laid on me

We windin' and grindin',
I bought you advises
Baby, you're like a fireburnin' motor on me

I know you like it when I put my hands like that
Whisper in you ear, tell me how you like that

Came Freaky-eakyless what I do rust
So come a little closer, come a little closer

No-one's gonna tell you to freaky like me, freaky like me
Freaky like freaky like me, freaky like me, freaky like me-
Me-me, No-one

Shawty, know I never ever ever pulled you
Do you whisker on a freaky year as I do

Shawty, know I never ever ever pulled you
Do you whisker on a freaky year as I do

Cause I'm a going crazy when you do me like that
Your freaky-eaky got me holding ridin tracks

Everytime you think I wanna push it right back
Come back, I need that no one can fix it like that

Mira, Madcon, Ey,
No one can fix it like that, Come on

No-one's gonna tell you to freaky like me, freaky like me
Freaky like freaky like me, freaky like me, freaky like me-
Me-me, No-one

No-one's gonna tell you to freaky like me, freaky like me
Freaky like freaky like me, freaky like me, freaky like me-
Me-me, No-one
