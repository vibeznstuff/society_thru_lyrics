I got your emails
You just don't get females now, do you?
What's in my heart
Is not in your head, anyway

Mate, you're too late
And you weren't worth the wait, now were you?
It's out of my hands
Since you blew your last chance when you played me

You'll have to cry me out
You'll have to cry me out
The tears that will fall mean nothing at all
It's time to get over yourself

Baby, you ain't all that
Baby, there's no way back
You can keep talkin'
But baby, I'm walkin' away

When I found out
You messed me about, I was broken
Back then I believed you
Now I don't need ya no more

The pic on your phone
Proves you weren't alone, she was with you, yeah
Now I couldn't care about who, what or where
We're through

You'll have to cry me out
You'll have to cry me out
The tears that will fall mean nothing at all
It's time to get over yourself

Baby, you ain't all that
Baby, there's no way back
You can keep talkin'
But baby, I'm walkin' away

Gonna have to cry me out
Gonna have to cry me out
Boy, there ain't no doubt
Gonna have to cry me out

Won't hurt a little bit
Boy, better get used to it
You can keep talkin'
But baby, I'm walkin' away

You'll have to cry me out
You'll have to cry me out
The tears that will fall mean nothing at all
It's time to get over yourself

'Cause baby you ain't all that
Baby, there's no way back
You can keep talkin'
Baby, I'm walkin' away

You'll have to cry me out
You'll have to cry me out
