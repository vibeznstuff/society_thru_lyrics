M with the I with
The S-T double E Q
All I want is
To be with you
Mis-teeq with
The one Sunship
All I want
Is to be with you
But I just got to live
Live my own life too
All I need to know
(Need to know that the world)
That the world is nuts
Snap my fingers (fingers) and
Everything is fine
That's all (that's all)
Firing it up and away we go

Sitting looking in
The mirror like Alice
Through the looking glass
Life's a never ending journey
Be careful not to go too fast
Sometimes I can't help myself
From falling in too deep
I know it may be hard to
Tell your love is calling me
Oh-ah, all I want to be, oh-ah
And away we go
Oh-ah, all I want is (oh-ah)
Gonna get on the mic
Gonna make you whine

All I want
Is to be with you
But I just got to live
Live my own life too
All I need to know
(Need to know that the world)
That the world is nuts
I snap my fingers (fingers)
And everything is fine (woah)
That's all (that's all)

Floating on a river of dreams
On a magic carpet ride
Take control of my destiny
I know it's just a matter of time
That I will find that midas touch
And everything will turn to gold
It would mean nothing
Without you here to hold

Oh-ah, all I want to be, oh-ah
And away we go
Oh-ah, all I want is oh-ah
Gonna get on the mic
Gonna make you whine

All I want
Is to be with you
But I just got to live
Live my own life too
All I need to know
(Need to know that the world)
That the world is nuts
I snap my fingers (fingers) and
Everything is fine
That's all (that's all)
Firing it up and away we go

I can read it in the stars that
What I want is who you are
I will lay my hair down for you
A thousand times to show you
That when you reach me at the top
I'm gonna give you all I got
And wherever we go
Our hearts will follow

It's a UK thing
Stuff that we bring
No one to burn
Let the journey begin
We're the Mis-teeq
We're in chorus we sing
Quick off the mark
Ring a ding ding ding
In a mix with a bag of tricks
Feel the vibe
With the one Sunship
Move to the beat
It's about music
Roll through these tracks
With fresh tactics

All I want
Is to be with you
But I just got to live
Live my own life too
All I need to know
(Need to know that the world)
That the world is nuts
I snap my fingers (fingers) and
Everything is fine
That's all (that's all)
Firing it up and away we go

All I want
Is to be with you
But I just got to live
Live my own life too
All I need to know
(Need to know that the world)
That the world is nuts
I snap my fingers (fingers) and
Everything is fine
That's all (that's all)
Firing it up and away we go

Oh-ah oh-ah oh-ah oh-ah
Oh-ah oh-ah oh-ah oh-ah

Boy I want to be with you (woah)
I want to live
My own life too (woah)
And I got to have it all (woah)
That's all (that's all)
That's all (woah)
I'm gonna snap my fingers (woah)
Everything is fine (woah)
Want to have it all (woah)
Woah-ah woah-ah
Woah-ah woah-ah
Woah-ah woah-ah
Woah-ah woah-ah
