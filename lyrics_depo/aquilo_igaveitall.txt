This glass it breaks,
So delicate it shatters round my feet,
And my hands they bleed,
A stain I’ll always remember,
A stain that stays with me,
But this changes you,
Its harder now we’re breaking,
And I should know its never right for me to say,
That I wanted this,
I know I cant but I can still recall,

I gave it all,
Given up on luck my heads above the dust,

This love you broke,
Come closer darling don’t forget to fake,
A smile you had,
You tried so hard to fool yourself instead,

You gave it all,
Given up on luck your heads above the dust,
You gave it all,
I waited by the other side my friend,

I’ve waited by the other side my friend,
You’ll find it funny when you’re looking back some day.
You gave it all,

Given up on luck your heads above the dust,
You gave it all,
I waited by the other side my friend.
