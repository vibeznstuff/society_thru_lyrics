Being blind or build a shrine
To vanquish takes away without return
With chains you're bound
The best died last the looking glass
Exterminating and you might well find
It's just a matter of time 

Around and around and around again
Around and around and around again 

Two converse and two advance
Always wailing up the city's found
On solid ground
A broken tree, a bended knee
Forever or until the evolving night
Shall turn to clay
