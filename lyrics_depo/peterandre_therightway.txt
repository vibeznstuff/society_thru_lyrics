Thinkin back to the time when I was so into you
I thought that I knew it all
my perception of love 
well it was something to do
but I didn't expect the thought
I understand your feelings of doubt
I know I must have let you down
but I wonder would you be around 
if I loved you the right way
Loved you the right way
I would have put that smile upon your face
Loved you the right way
Never thought that I'd thank you for the heart and the pain
and the changes you put me through
I guess I needed to look at my intentions again
I didn't give enough to you
My mind has never been so clear
and I feel my happiness is near
But I wonder if you'd still be here if I loved you the right way
coz you deserve the right way
I should have put that smile upon your face
I should have kept you in my warm embrace
Loved you the right way
Sometimes love is so mistaken
simple values put aside
Mind love is just a ride
When its over no one seems to care
If I ever find myself with someone new 
I'll remember what I learnt from you
Yeah
and I will love her the right way
love her the right way
I will put that smile on her face
I will keep her warm in my embrace
I will love her baby
make each day a better day
never gonna sacrifice a mean
I will love her the right way
I'm gonna love her baby
I'm gonna love her baby
