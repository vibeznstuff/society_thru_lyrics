Oh hot damn, this is my jam
Keep me partyin to the A.M.
You all don't understand
Make me throw my hands in the
ayer, ay, ayer, ayer, ay, ayer


Hey this my jam, you all don't understand
I'll make you understand
what's pumping in my CD player, player
probably all night like yayer yayer
Shawty got her hands in the ayer, ayer
Make me wanna take you dayer
There I go here I go here is my song
DJ bring it back come in my zone
I get paid for them couple bones
The next wop until the early morn
I need that crunk when I'm up in the club
Even my when my Chevy pull up on them dubs
Give me that drop yellow waist like a drug
Little mama hot and she might show me love
O hot damn
Celebrate to the A.M
I love it so much it got me saying




Hey, hey I might just start the wave
Like I'm at a ball game do my thang
Hands up high, I got money in the bank
I'm so fly 747 pain
Rock it no stop it how I got my name
Baby keep popping, you might get the fame
Walk the red carpet won't see you the same
I get the stunting forget my name
Ride with me
Ride with me
Represent the city vibe with me
Make me throw it up ma timid in the club
Go ahead throw it up gotta wonder
How much to show enough to stare (stare)
I'm hood so it's really unfair (unfair)
Shorty go ahead and get bare (bare)
We ain't gonna treat our city like the mayor (mayor)




Alright now stop
oh, put your hands in the ayer
it's a stick (a stick up, stick up)
it's a stick up, just to the ceiling, man
