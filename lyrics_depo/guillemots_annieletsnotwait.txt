I found something crying; it was my soul
I fed it milk so it wouldn't grow old
We crossed the borderline at dawn
And woke up in a field of corn
My father told me I was late
I better start oiling the gate
Said that those that rush will fall
But I don't want to wait for waves
I don't want to wait at all

Annie, let's not wait
Let's cross the river now
We could sit for years
Staring at our fears
Oh they're such pretty things
They're so cute
But our dreams are all we really need
To grow

I found something dying; it was my light
It had resigned itself to night
So I threw it out a fishing line
And said catch your will and then catch mine

Annie, let's not wait
Let's cross the river now
We could sit for years
Staring at our fears
Oh they're such pretty things
They're so cute
But in the end they're just a suit

Oh annie let's not wait
Time's not on our side
Well it never was
You know that deep inside
Oh just look at you
With your ruffled hair
Oh I love you
And that's all you need to know

Annie annie
