Hey yo, here's a real scoop, homie loc
Them fools around my way gettin' high off gunsmoke
And I ain't talkin' about the high like Indo
The kind of high that make you call your kin folks
And tell loc, Johnny's dead
A fourteen-year-old kid put a nine to his head
All because he wanted that gear he was sportin'
Gimme that, while you're at it, gimme them Jordans
Johnny tried to jet, homie wasn't hearin' that
Johnny tried to run and got gatted in the back
Now tell me what happens to the way life used to me?
'Cuz in this game, there'll be no future, G
When will all of y'all learn
That if you're playin' with fire too long, you're bound to get burned
This ain't a small thing I'm addressin'
It's a big thing, take it from the daddy as a lesson


Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a shame
It's a shame, it's a shame alright
Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a...


It's a shame the way this thing goes down
How one lay you down just to show he don't play around
He goes to sleep with a head full of anger
And wakes up involved in a child's gang banger
I'm talkin' about a-tisket, a-tasket (a-tisket, a-tasket)
Not knowing next day he'll be laying in a casket
So what you think of that, son?
In the arcade, they playing the games ain't fun (yeah)
Something like Pac-Man
Same name but the game as you put it in the sack and
Running to the next board
And gat down the fools standing in the way of the door
There's no board and no points
And in this game, then he saw Pac-Man wants
The game that goes for always blowing
Then you'll slip up and they'll smoke you


Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a shame
It's a shame, it's a shame alright
Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a shame


None of this exists with the word peace (peace, brother)
You gotta do more than two fingers, man, please
Get a game that they gotta go by
Instead of "watch out quick, I'll send him to the sky"
Theere ain't nothin' to be playin' with
So listen what I give and what I be sayin', kid
Take it from a kid's point of view
'Cause on my way to school, I'll be watching you


Big, big daddy in his caddy with all of his boys
It only had weeks, it's a joy
That's the first part, second part has having hard
But when you get count, you know how to restart
You gotta know how to watch your back (watch your back)
'Cause if you're slack, huh, you're going in the sack (yeah)
I advise y'all all watch out for the game
'Cause the game ain't nothin' but a...
