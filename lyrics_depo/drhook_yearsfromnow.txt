Years from now, I want you years from now
And I hold you years from now as I love you tonight
You are my one true friend, always my one true friend
And I love you 'till I'd say as I love you tonight 

I know this world that we live in can be hard
Now and then and it will be again
Many times we've been down
Still love has kept us together the flame never dies 
When I look in your eyes the future I see

Wanting you years from now
And holding you years from now
And loving you years from now
As I love you tonight

I know this world that we live in can be hard
Now and then and it will be again
Many times we've been down
Still love has kept us together the flame never dies 
When I look in your eyes the future I see

Wanting you years from now
And holding you years from now
And loving you years from now
As I love you tonight
