Help me
How would you gon' do love this way?
I work so hard for you everyday
While you out late night do what you do
Chillin' with-who? -
While I'm sitting at home
Come on with it!

(I don't know what this world is coming to...)

I just can't rely on you
I just can't rely on you
Yeah, you got that good stuff but that don't last (no way)
So I just can't rely on you

Oh, Lord
How am I to ever explain
How my melted heart went right down the drain?
'Cause if you don't want me
(Release)
Repeat
(Believe)
Want some
(Want some)
Take me

He will take me right out your way
Come on with it!

(I don't know what this world is coming to...)

I just can't rely on you
I just can't rely on you
Yeah, you got that good stuff but that don't last (no way)
So I just can't rely on you

Gonna go
Really
You can say what you want
But I'm out that door
Can't stop me
Oh, my man
Oh, Lord

(I don't know what this world is coming to...)

I just can't rely on you
I just can't rely on you
Yeah, you got that good stuff but that don't last (no way)
So I just can't rely on you

Just telling it like it is
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Change your ways
Don't I deserve it babe
Look at here
'Cause that's why you drive me out of my mind

I just can't rely on you
I just can't rely on you
Yeah, you got that good stuff but that don't last (no way)
Ain't good enough for me, baby
Oh, baby

I don't know what this world is coming to...
