 Hey come here girl, let me squeeze on this right here
 What’s up, TQ?
 You know you like that, bring your ass over here
Thug: Hey break yourself nigger
Oh fuck
Just give him whatever he wants
Shut up bitch (gun cocked)
Oh, look out boo, watch out
(gunshots, glass smashing)
Yo, yo let me up in this mother fucker
(Car door slamming, and tyres squealing)

At night I can't seem to get no sleep
Addicted to indo and Hennessey
I'm stressed homes - got my vest on...
Let's hit the streets it’s time to put the west on
Friday night and I’m chillin with my baby in a black 600 Lorenzo's on it
And I'm… All up on them thighs, smokin on doja
So I guess I didn’t see them niggas behind me
We at the stop light - Get out your car nigga
Before I exit - they start to pullin triggers
So now I'm duckin and diving try to surviving
All I can hear is gun shots and crying
Then in an instant - the crying stopped
Look at my Benz all my windows bucked out
I see my girlfriend layin on the asphalt bleeding lookin dead at me
And all I can say is


Bye bye Baby
I can’t believe it, these niggas done shot my baby
The only thing that make me go crazy
Somebody gonna feel my 380
My My Baby won’t live to see it
It's gonna be murder I guarantee it
You already had it coming boy for stepping 2 me
But ya’ll shouldn't have fucked with my baby

Now I met her at the Beverly and she was the bombest
She had me going nigga - I'm gonna be honest
And she was stacked with big bags behind her
Matter of fact - she kinda looked like Tyra
All the niggas use to stop when they seen her
Dressed in black - laid back demeanor
Nigga she gone now - And I'm all upset
I'm like a grown child - I want my baby back
But now it’s on pal - All things behind us
I'm gonna take you where no-one can find ya
Mind ya, I'm about to go crazy
Gimme my Baby - Gimme my Baby


Bye bye Baby
I can’t believe it, these niggas done shot my baby
The only thing that make me go crazy
Somebody gonna feel my 380
My My Baby won’t live to see it
It's gonna be murder I guarantee it
You already had it coming boy for stepping 2 me
But ya’ll shouldn't have fucked with my baby

Now I try not to think about it all the things that we did together
We make the bedroom walls shake from in the living room
I was so infatuated with everything you do
Somebody took you away from me with a shell or two
And I'm gonna ride, cos that's what the hell I do
Gonna be some madness, Girl I'm tellin you
This shell’s 4 you
What they wanna do


Bye bye Baby
I can’t believe it (no) these niggas done shot my baby
The only thing that make me go crazy
Somebody gonna feel my 380 (yeah, yeah)
My My Baby won’t live to see it
It's gonna be murder I guarantee it
You already had it coming boy for stepping 2 me
But ya’ll shouldn't have fucked with my baby


Bye bye Baby
I can’t believe it, these niggas done shot my baby (no)
The only thing that make me go crazy (my baby)
