(Lookin' through the window)
(Lookin' through the window)
(Lookin' through the window)
(The window)
(Through the window)
(Lookin' through the window)

Lookin' through the windows
The window to your heart
Oh baby, yeah
I can see it's cloudy
The rain's about to start

Lookin' through the windows
(Lookin' through the window)
It seems I caused your fears
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And that little doubt, girl
(And your little doubt, girl)
And now it's bringing tears
(And it's bringing tears)

(Remember)
Just remember whatever makes you feel that way
Don't you worry 'cause I'm gonna stay
Right by your side
(By your side)
To keep on lookin' through the windows
Lookin' in your eyes

Looking through the windows
(Lookin' through the window)
Seems like the only way, yeah
I can't know your feelings
If you still love me today

(Remember)
Just remember whatever makes you feel that way
Don't you worry 'cause I'm gonna stay
Right by your side
(By your side)
To keep on lookin' through the windows
Lookin' in your eyes
