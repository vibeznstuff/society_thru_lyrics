Feeling the remnants, caught in an instance
Blink of an eye, no goodbye
I had a notion, deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky, oh my

Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could've just wash away, away
Prayed our love wasn't vain
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?

If I would've known,
If I would've known, if I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be—wanted to be your enemy, no,
But if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been you

The repercussions, I'm missing your loving
Haunts me tonight,
The ghosts are alive
All of the memories
Of serenity
Dwindle in my mind
All the time

Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could've just wash away, away
Prayed our love wasn't vain
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?

If I would've known,
If I would've known, if I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be—wanted to be your enemy, no,
But if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been you

If I would've known,
If I would've known, if I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be—wanted to be your enemy, no,
But if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been you
