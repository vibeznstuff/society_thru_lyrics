Baby, you the best 'cause you worked me out
I keep building walls up but you tear 'em down
I'm fighting, I don't wanna like it but you know I like it
But you know I like it, like it, like it
Used to always think I was bullet proof
But you got an AK and you're blowing through
Explosive, you don't even know it, I want you to know it
I want you to know it, know it, know it

All of them other boys can walk away
They ain't even in the game
'Cause they know that you own it
You got this swag, you got this attitude
Wanna hear you say my name
'Cause you got me...


Flying with your love, shining with your love, riding with your love.
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love.
One hit with your love. Can't quit with your love. So sick but so what?
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love.


Everybody wants what I got with you
'Cause I'm standing on top with a killer view
Inspired feeling like a million, I'm one in a million
I'm one in a million, million, million
I ain't even here, I'm in outer space
Like I'm Venus, you're Mars in the Milky Way
It's crazy what you're doing to me, how you do it to me.

How you do it to me, to me, to me
All of them other boys can walk away
They ain't even in the game
'Cause they know that you own it
You got this swag, you got this attitude
Wanna hear you say my name
'Cause you got me...


Flying with your love, shining with your love, riding with your love.
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love.
One hit with your love. Can't quit with your love. So sick but so what?
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love.


Oh, you got it. Yeah, yeah, you got it.
I could slow it down, speed it up how you want it, girl, all night long.
And I don't even care if you sing my songs wrong.
1st date, 1st base, 2nd date, 2nd base,
3rd date (ha ha ha), you're looking at me funny,
You got a hard shell but the middle's so yummy.

'Cause you got me flying, baby. I'm shining, baby. I'm riding with your love
One hit, baby. I can't quit, baby. I'm so sick but so what?
Flying, baby. I'm shining, baby. I'm riding with your love
One hit, baby. I can't quit, baby. I'm so sick but so what?


Flying with your love, shining with your love, riding with your love.
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love.
One hit with your love. Can't quit with your love. So sick but so what?
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love.
