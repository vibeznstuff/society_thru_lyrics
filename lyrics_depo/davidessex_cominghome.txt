Yesterday, ahah, I felt like crying
Got to go, make a move, back home
Was I right, ahah, to cause a commotion
Am I right, to go home

Home, when I think about the times, I was wrong but was I right
There's no question in my mind that I'm coming home tonight, tonight
Yes I'm coming home tonight

Oh I'm coming home
Oh I'm coming home

Start again, ahah, build a beginning
Make a plan, make a stand to go home

Walk a line, ahah, to go back in time
Leaving it, going home

Home, when I think about the times, I was wrong but was I right
There's no question in my mind that I'm coming home tonight, tonight
Yes I'm coming home tonight

Oh I'm coming home
Oh I'm coming home

ahah

ahah

Home, when I think about the times I wrong but was I right
There's no question in my mind that I'm coming home tonight, tonight
That I'm coming home tonight

Oh I'm coming home
Oh I'm coming home

Oh I'm coming home
Oh I'm coming home

Oh I'm coming home (yesterday)
Oh I'm coming home (coming home)

Oh I'm coming home (yesterday)
Oh I'm coming home (coming home)

Oh I'm coming home (make a stand)
