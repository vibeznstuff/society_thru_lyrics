Any minute you will feel the chemistry
Vibrations in the brain can't ever be explained
Slip away and out of sight, feel the magnet of a night
The circus that you see is where you have to be

If I've seen it all before why's this bus taking me back again?
If I don't need anymore why's this bus taking me back again?

Feel the weight letting go, feel more lightness than you've ever known
You can't see when light's so strong, you can't see when light is gone

If I've seen it all before why's this bus taking me back again?
If I don't need anymore why's this bus taking me back again?
