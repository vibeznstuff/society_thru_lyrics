I keep on moving with the lights on
So come and play me just one more song
I keep on moving with the lights on
So you won’t scare me with the lights on

Step into the club
And then come a turn and them watch me,
Step on to the floor man, 
Watch me on a clock way
Bass come like a trigger and 
The DJ come and shot me
Rhythm takes control
And nothing can stop me
But them got me
Because take a glass of water now
Dance is getting hotter now
Drowning in the heat now, I don't wanna leave
Rude girl, you know we look hot
From we tick the time, we drip drop
Caught up in the night,
We ain’t ready to go home yet


Said I will keep on going until they say so
And even when they do it’s so hard for me to go
While some others at the clock room
And some others out the door
We can keep on going in the middle of the floor


I keep on moving with the lights on
So come and play me just one more song
I keep on moving with the lights on
So you won’t scare me with the lights on

Now you can watch me if you like it
Cause I really don’t care
I’ll be the same,
Even if it’s only me inside in here
Cause this is where I’m meant to be
I ain’t going nowhere
You'll have to come and move me
If you want me out of here


Said I will keep on going until they say so
And even when they do it’s so hard for me to go
While some others at the clock room
And some others out the door
We can keep on going in the middle of the floor


I keep on moving with the lights on
So come and play me just one more song
I keep on moving with the lights on
So you won’t scare me with the lights on

Just one more, please take on gimme
Mr. Sound Boy, 
You no see me,
Free in the heat,
And the beat 'till I sleep
Lord have mercy, oh the vibe is so sweet
Bad girl stamina can't done,
Lights on, still I dip and go down,
Tick it and a tock,
And a dip it and a drop it,
And a rock it, my selector don't stop it.


I keep on moving with the lights on (I keep on moving with the lights on)
So come and play me just one more song
I keep on moving with the lights on
So you won’t scare me with the lights on 

Gimme one more song (ohh..),
With the lights on,
Lights on

I keep on moving with the lights on
Come on, play me one more time (yeah)
With the lights on
