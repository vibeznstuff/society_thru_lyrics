When you're low
And your knees can't rise
You feel helpless
And you're looking to the sky
Some people would say
To accept their fate
Well, if this is fate
Then we'll find a way to cheat

Cause, oh, oh, oh, oh we'll say a little prayer
But, oh, oh, oh, oh if the answer isn't fair

You know you can call on me
When you need somebody
You know you can call on me
When you can't stop the tears from falling down, down, down
You know you can call on me
Call on me, darling
You know you can call on me
Call on me, darling (Call on me)

When you're weary
And the road is dark
And I'll guide you
With the beating of my heart
And if the calvary
And the help don't come
Well, then we'll find a way
To dodge a smoking gun

Cause, oh, oh, oh, oh we'll say a little prayer
But, oh, oh, oh, oh if the answer isn't fair (then call on me)

You know you can call on me
When you need somebody
You know you can call on me
When you can't stop the tears from falling down, down, down
You know you can call on me
Call on me, darling
You know you can call on me
Call on me, darling (call on me)

When you're, you need someone (Just call on me)
You need somebody to cling to (Call on me)
When you're, you need someone (Just call on me)
You need somebody to dry your tears
When you're, you need someone (You can call me)
You need somebody to cling to (Just call on me)

Just call on me, love (Just call on me)
Just call on me, love (Call on me)
Just call on me, love (Just call on me)
Just call on me, love (Call on me)
Just call on me, love, on me
