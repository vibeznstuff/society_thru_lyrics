Baby, it's really amazing what I go through without you
You know sometimes I find myself counting
Counting the hours, the minutes, the seconds, the moments

Darling, please don't make me wait too long
I wanna love you, baby
Can't you see it's only you I want
And you I need

Please don't make me wait too long
I wanna love you, baby
Can't you see it's only you I want
And you I need

When I'm away from you
Seems like forever, yeah
Girl, if you only knew
What I go through without you

But knowing in a moment I'll
I'll see that face and see your smile (Give it here)
I turn the key (Give it here), open up the door (Give it here)
Girl, there you are, I can't take much more

Darling, please don't make me wait too long
I wanna love you, baby
Can't you see it's only you I want
And you I need

Please don't make me wait too long
