Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woah, ho ho

Everlasting, what a feeling
Just to know the love we've got is
Everlasting and never ending
Is all I need to keep on givin'

I was just an average girl
Playing the field, hoping
For someone to come into my world
Someone not afraid to look into my eyes

And make a connection
Then you walked in my direction
And from the moment that we touched
I knew what we found was

Everlasting, what a feeling
Just to know the love we've got is
Everlasting and never ending
Is all I need to keep on givin'

Walking down a one way street
I had to be careful
'Cause it seemed that every guy that I'd meet
Was looking just to have another one night stand

But through your devotion
I surrendered my emotion
I'm giving you the best of me
'Cause I'm sure that we'll be

Everlasting, what a feeling
Just to know the love we've got is
Everlasting and never ending
Is all I need to keep on givin'

Everlasting love, oh yeah
It's gonna be, it's gonna be a
Everlasting love, uh, ha

Even though the cold wind's blowin'
Nothing keeps our love from growin'
Through the fire we will survive together
Until the end of time

Everlasting, what a feeling
Just to know the love we've got is
Everlasting and never ending
Is all I need to keep on givin'

Everlasting, what a feeling
Our love's gonna grow
Even through the fire, baby
Everlasting and never ending

Even though the cold wind's blowin'
Nothing keeps our love from growing
Through the fire we will survive together
Until the end of time

Everlasting, what a feeling
It's gonna be, it's gonna be a
Everlasting and never ending
Until the end of time
And even through the fire, baby

Everlasting, what a feeling
Just to know that the love we've got is
Everlasting and never ending
What a feeling

Everlasting love, woah
Everlasting love, woah
Everlasting love, woah
Everlasting love, woah
