Valentino's got a booky shop and what he takes
He gives for what he's got
And what he's got he says he has not
Stolen from anyone

It's not that he don't tell the truth
Or even that he misspent his youth
It's just that he holds the proof
But you feel there's something's wrong

Waiting for an alibi
Waiting for an alibi
Waiting for an alibi
Waiting for an alibi

Valentino's in a cold sweat, placed all his money on that last bet
Against the odds he smokes another cigarette
Says that it helps him to forget
That he's a nervous wreck

It's not that he misses much
Or even that he's lost his lucky touch
It's just that he gambles so much
And you know that it's wrong

Waiting for an alibi
Waiting for an alibi
Waiting just to catch your eye
Waiting for an alibi

Waiting for an alibi
Try to say I told you I told you

Waiting for an alibi
Waiting just to get you
Waiting for an alibi
Waiting for an alibi
To say I told you
Waiting for an alibi
Waiting for an alibi
