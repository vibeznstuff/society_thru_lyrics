I wanna know
I wanna know, wanna know what your name is
Put you in a song, make you A-List
You could be the one who can say ooh
I wanna know
Why you acting like you don't know what your name is
You been tryna fight it for ages
What your name is, I'mma make you say ooh


I wanna know what your name is
And what your name means
We got a lot of time on the 18s
We can live our life in the mainstream
I ain't tryna click clack, hit that
I'm tryna hit that, big back, big fat
Sweet tunes give me big plaques
Fits that, tell the truth baby
Switch that, will back, big bang baby
Cut style on 'em, you know I'm the man baby
So I gotta send a shoutout to my fans baby
You know what I'm on, put you in a song
Doin' what I can, so I can't go wrong

We can go home, I know yours baby
You know I make you go oh

No pressure
Just wanna know what your name is

Come and shake it
I show you what you missin' while you listenin'
Better picture me and you, we kickin' it
In the 3, we just in our zone, yeah yeah yeah
Take you to the west end of the city, where it's made
Oh my, don't lie
Oh my, no lie
If I'm bein' honest, I want more than your name
See them niggas over there, we ain't the same
Oh my, don't lie
Oh my, don't lie
Baby, all you gotta do is lead the way
I'll make you say oh

Yo, I seen you round the way
I'm tryna build the confidence to confiscate your brain
Take a higher word to messiah, meh, I know your name
I want you on your back card you know I like your face
So mama come and groove with me, ooh missy
Competition should be choosing me, unity
I and I Selassie-I, Haile, Ake and I
Be on some ta-na-na ni, badness at back of my mind
So come on walk wit me, talk wit me,
Intuition into tort cities now it's more silly,
Got the ex-girl calling me, but it's poor really
Cause its always falling short wit me, thas a surety
So won't you, take a stroll wit me girl, I can,
Put you fast asleep girl and I can make you scream
And make you say oh


I wanna know
I wanna know, wanna know what your name is
Put you in a song, make you A-List
You could be the one who can say ooh
I wanna know
Why you acting like you don't know what your name is
You been tryna fight it for ages
What your name is, I'mma make you say ooh
