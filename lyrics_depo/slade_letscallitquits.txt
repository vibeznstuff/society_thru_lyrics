You keep me straight, I'll keep you narrow,
You get the magic that can chill me to the marrow,
But I got something here for you
It's big enough for two


You want me, let's call it quits, let's call it quits
Before we break a one another into bits
Let's call a tie - let's call a tie
Before we make a one another start to cry

You want me sweet, I want you pretty,
You got some funny lines
That make you sound so witty,
But I got something here for you
It's big enough for two



You get the why, I got the wherefore,
You got me trapped hook line
And sinker and so therefore,
I still got something here for you
It's big enough for two
