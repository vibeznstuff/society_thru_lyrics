I think it's time to talk with you.
Think it's time to realize.
Where is the love?

Are we gonna stay together...
or is it time to say goodbye?
Where is the love?


Give me a reason...
to hold on to what we've got.
Must be a reason... 
to hold on to what we've got. 

Time has come to set things right.
Is it worth another fight?
Tell me the truth.

Is there something on your mind?
Tell me what you hide inside.
Tell me the truth.



Are there things that I should know?
Will you stay or will you go?
Where is the love?

Tell me. Is there hope in sight?
Gotta read between the lines.
Where is the love?
