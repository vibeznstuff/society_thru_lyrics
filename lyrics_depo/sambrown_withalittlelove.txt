Just one moment
A little time and you will find the feeling has gone - has gone
If I could show you
To close your mind would be a crime - just hold on - hold on

I'll be there when you call me
I'll be waiting

With love
With a little love 
With love
With a little love 

The way it seems to me
It's just an ordinary pain and it won't go.Let it go
It's just a memory
A time that's gone and doesn't matter any more
Let it go

I'll be there when you call me
I'll be waiting

With love
With a little love 
With love
With a little love 

There's a way to turn it all around
You have everything you need

With love
With a little love 
With love
With a little love
