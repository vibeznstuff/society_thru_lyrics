Yeah (wake up, wake up)
Free your mind (I said wake up)
Good morning America
Good morning America (I said wake up)
Good morning America
Good morning America

Now, what's freedom to you?
Let's talk about it, take a minute, think it through
I'm all about it, but the concept seems loose
The cops will still shoot us down on Channel 5 news
Lock us up for anything we do to pay dues
Some of us woke while some stay snooze
Zombies walking around trippin' over its shoes
The knowledge is official but it's often misused
America my masseuse, massaging my back
Tryna' act like, she ain't gonna do me like Pratt
Geronimo, take a leap and lay flat
I'm down to go for my message to spread across the map
Holy, cross on my back got a bullseye on it
I gotta get stoned to fulfill my moment
Oppress my oppressor, suppress the opponent
Channel my ancestor, he wouldn't condone it
In search of the healing components that you would notice
If you took notice, but you too nosey
Time to wake up
Won't you come and smell the hot coffee
Stick your nose in the wrong places, no wonder you OD
I swear the whole world on me
I'm nothing close to the old me
If you never knew me then it's too late to be homies
Homie say fuck what you told me
I'm riding all by my lonely
Waiting for the big homie to take these chains off me

I came from
A dream
That the black man dream is long ago
I'm actually a therapist
