Now when I, was a little girl
My mama sat me down and tole me all about the world
Now she, she told me true, she said one day you would probably break my heart in two
But now I, I beg to differ baby, I don't take it the way you like to give it
Now look at you, on your knees, sweet as sugar baby, sayin' please...
I said I'm looking at you, well
Said I'm looking at you, aah hah
I said I'm looking at you, yeah


Now who the hell are you, to treat me like that?
I don't care where you've been, what you've done, or where you're at
Now who the hell are you, to act the way you do?
You won't be smiling by the time I'm through with you
Now who the hell are you?


Well now, ain't no cheating, ain't no lying
Ain't no explaining, justifying going on around here
Now stand up and be a man
If you want it, come and get it baby, catch me if you can

Come on and catch me if you can
Well you know that, if you want it, come and get it, if you want it, oww
