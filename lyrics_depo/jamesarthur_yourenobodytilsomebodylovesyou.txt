Long gone and fallen down but I'm loving how it tastes
I look around for desire, love run away
Hold back, we're falling down, and I show you how it breaks
If I can give it, I'll take it, all of the way

And I've got a lot left to learn, babe

You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
It's hard times when nobody wants you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
Get up on top, I'll make it pop, honey

You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
It's a cold heart, when nobody holds you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
Get up on top, I'll make it pop, honey

A cold star coming down
I was way off of the pace
I waited long for the day, now the day comes for me

When I look back we're falling out, you live with a break
You'd always give it, I take it, all the way

We've still got so much to learn, babe

You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
It's hard times when nobody wants you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
Get up on top, I'll make it pop, honey

You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
It's a cold heart, when nobody holds you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
Get up on top, I'll make it pop, honey

Don't you stop me, I will get what's coming to me
I am ready, baby, I will be somebody
Don't you stop me, I will get what's coming to me
I am ready, baby, I will be somebody

You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
It's hard times when nobody wants you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
Get up on top, I'll make it pop, honey

You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
It's a cold heart, when nobody holds you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
Get over top, I'll make it pop, honey
