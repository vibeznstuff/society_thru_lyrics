You won't need nobody else but me...
You'll find
I'm gonna invite you to try my machines
Programme an offer you just can't refuse
I'm gonna invite you to share all my dreams
You've got nothing to lose

You won't need nobody else but me...

You'll find
I'm gonna invite you to try my machines
Programme an offer you just can't refuse
I'm gonna invite you to share all my dreams
You've got nothing to lose

Recycle your thoughts
I'll rewire your mind
I'll punch in some new points of view
To make sure you find
You've got nothing to lose

You don't need nobody else but me...
