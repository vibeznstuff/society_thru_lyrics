Say, sugar-honey you've gotta act like me
Well, you can take a passion-lovin' panther
Make him week at the knees
You can shake him like a rattle, and roll him like a dice
But, honey, you know I'm too big to be nice
I gave away my independence to all them evil guys
And when I got too hot they put my lips on ice
Now I don't hold out with those wise-guys. 
I see through their disguise
'Cause, honey, you know I'm too big to be fooled twice
Well, I don't know all the answers, but I guess I know my share
And I've taken all the chances, but I never really care
Because I'm too big to be used
You know I'm too big for my boots
You know I'm too big to be abused
And honey...I never lose!

Now listen baby, watch the way you walk
And when it comes to talkin', watch the way you talk
He'll tear ya down and break ya and he'll make you if he can
But, honey, you're too big, too big for that man
You know he can't understand ya. You're breakin' all the rules
He's tried so hard to land ya. 
Just send him back to school
Because you're too big to be used
You know you're too big for your boots
You know you're too big to be abused
And honey...you'll never lose!
