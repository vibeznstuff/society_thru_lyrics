All I fuck is bad bitches
I don't want no mediocre
Don't want no mediocre
I don't want no mediocre, no
Bad bitches only
Ain't no mediocre
Don't want no mediocre
I won't hit no mediocre
You a bad bitch
Stunting on the mediocre
All over the mediocre
You stunting on the mediocre
Seven bitches with me
And ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes
They so far from mediocre


Right hand in the air I solemnly swear
I never fuck a bitch if she don't do her hair
No more, you won't get no dick if there's a bush down there
Girl I should see nothing but pussy when I look down there
You come fuck with a nigga what better to do
He call and ask how you doing tell him better than you, yeah
I'm kicked back with four pieces like kit kat
Me fucking if you ain't a dime just forget that
Pretty face, fat ass, if she don't have
Have one of these, well I think I'll pass
I just handed her the keys to a new drop Jag
When she took it I took it back, you shoulda asked for a Benz
That's mediocre bitch


All I fuck is bad bitches
I don't want no mediocre
Don't want no mediocre
I don't want no mediocre, no
Bad bitches only
Ain't no mediocre
Don't want no mediocre
I won't hit no mediocre
You a bad bitch
Stunting on the mediocre
All over the mediocre
You stunting on the mediocre
Seven bitches with me
And ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes
They so far from mediocre


Heard he wanna lay it down on Iggy Iggy
Gave it to him twice, now he want a three, Mike BBDiva
But I need a bad boy, rest in peace Whitney, pardon me
But I don't think none of these bitches fucking with me
Want a billboard bitch stop running in place
Heels on me saying gimme six inches of space
Courtside while designer frames cover my face
Now everybody in the game wanna get em a taste
I'm still Grand Hustle first lady fuck you pay me
Bet he won't go twelve rounds with the million dollar baby
I can change your life quick stop playing with me
And if you ain't talking money what you saying to me


All I fuck is bad bitches
I don't want no mediocre
Don't want no mediocre
I don't want no mediocre, no
Bad bitches only
Ain't no mediocre
Don't want no mediocre
I won't hit no mediocre
You a bad bitch
Stunting on the mediocre
All over the mediocre
You stunting on the mediocre
Seven bitches with me
And ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes
They so far from mediocre


I'm in Brazil with a bitch
Catch me in a mansion in the hills with a bitch
Get her out dem tennis shoes, throw some heels on a bitch
I'm the type of nigga split a mil with a bitch
Hold up, only if she bad though
Out here trying to find someone that better than my last go
Take her to my castle, drown her in my cash flow
Say your dick so little she can fit it in her asshole
Told me she can write this shit no further than a cab go
Said I got that dumb dick, she wanna be my tutor
So she give me brain, getting head on the scooter
Had sex on the beach from Bermuda up to Cuba
I done fucked a lot of dimes but I'm looking for a cuter bitch
You the shit, what she say when she got to sit
When I ain't around give a damn who you do it with
Super thick pretty face, Menage a venti
Twenty at the same time, wanna get ya rent paid


All I fuck is bad bitches
I don't want no mediocre
Don't want no mediocre
I don't want no mediocre, no
Bad bitches only
Ain't no mediocre
Don't want no mediocre
I won't hit no mediocre
You a bad bitch
Stunting on the mediocre
All Over the mediocre
You stunting on the mediocre
Seven bitches with me
And ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes
They so far from mediocre, yeah
