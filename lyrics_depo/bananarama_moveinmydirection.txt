It's been seven days since my last confession
And I really don't know where to begin
I should have called a taxi
Should have gone straight home
But we could just stay here and no one will know

Move in my direction, I'll show you where to go
Won't you move in my direction
Real slow
Won't you move in my direction, I'll show you where to go
Won't you move in my direction
Real slow

Don't you know that you are my fascination
And I just can't wait to do it all again
I should have left the party
Should have left alone
But I want you too much, I couldn't say no

Move in my direction, I'll show you where to go
Won't you move in my direction
Real slow
Won't you move in my direction
(No one knows)
I'll show you where to go
(I'm not comin' home tonight)
Won't you move in my direction
(Why does wrong)
Real slow
(Feel so right)

Why does wrong feel so right

Move in my direction, I'll show you where to go
Won't you move in my direction
Real slow
Won't you move in my direction
(No one knows)
I'll show you where to go
(I'm not comin' home tonight)
Won't you move in my direction
(Why does wrong)
Real slow
(Feel so right)

Move in my direction
(No one knows)
I'll show you where to go
(I'm not comin' home tonight)
Won't you move in my direction
(Why does wrong)
Real slow
(Feel so right)
