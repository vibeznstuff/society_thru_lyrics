You left me with a problem -
Now I know what it's all about.
You took my heart and split it up

Now you know what it's all about.
How do you feel my love

Do you feel it as I walked away?
How do you feel my love
Do you feel it as I walked away?

Who knows what kind of pity for
Excuse you from yourself
To just be find the misery
That you put yourself within.
How do you feel my love

Need to find myself
all that I've got left
Used up
ooh
I'm used up.
Need to cry but still got to show my will
Been used too much.

How do you feel my love
Need to find myself
all that I've got left

How do you feel my love
