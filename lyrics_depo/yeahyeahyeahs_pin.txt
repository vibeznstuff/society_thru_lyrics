things are feeling thin i know, i know
lost my seat again where i'll go, i'll go,
pushing in the pin
i know, i know
we're gonna go back in
we're gonna go go go



i like to sleep with them
pushing in the pin
i like to sleep with them
i know, i know
we're gonna go back in
we're gonna go go go
we're gonna go back in
we're gonna go go go
