I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then you coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get loose
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real


Your girl just kissed a girl
I do bi chicks
Shake for a sheik
I'm throwing these Emirates in the sky
Spending this As-salam alaykum
Peace to M.O.N.E.Y.
I love my beaches, south beaches
Surfboard in high tide
I could just roll up
Cause I'm swole up
So that birthday cake get the cobra
Bugatti for real, I'm cold bra
That auto-biography rover
Got the key to my city it's over
It's no thots, only Anna Kournikova's
I set records, ratchets hold up
(I set records, ratchets hold up)


I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then you coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get loose
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
And they already know me
It's going down for real


And they already know me
It's going down further than femurs
Girls get wetter than Katrina
Yeah my girl you never seen her
Cause my tints by limousiners
My touch say it's the Midas
We the plus yo man a minus
My team blowing on that slam
Make you cough-cough that's Bronchitis
Put yo hands up
It's a stick up, no more makeup
Get that ass on the floor
Ladies put your lipstick up
Double entendre, double entendre
While you're hating I get money
Then I double on tonkas


I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then you coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get loose
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real


Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it


It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
