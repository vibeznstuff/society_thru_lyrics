Rock my heart...

Celebrate, celebrate vitality
Free your mind, do just what you want to
You and I, celebrate a special love
That is why I wanna be with you

Rock my heart
When we come together
We'll make it better
Every day
Rock my heart
When we come together
We'll make it better
Every day

Celebrate, let the music fill your soul
Take a ride, yeah, ride on the rhythm
Celebrate, we can make the world go round
You and I, you and I

Rock my heart
When we come together
We'll make it better
Every day
Rock my heart
When we come together
We'll make it better
Every day
