Last night we made a movie
And tonight will be the sequel
Send a Pic let a nigga get a preview
Right Now
Coming suited up on my GQ
And imma make you take it off with your teeth too
Nasty, tonight we skinny dipping no pool girl
Except the one between your legs i'm a fool girl
Put your skirt on, turn you to my school girl
Smack you with my ruler girl
You know how I do it girl


What time do you get off? I wanna see you tonight
What time would you be here? I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna just kiss you now, I wanna just touch you now
I wanna just give you all my love tonight

And tell 'em you'll be here in the morning, oh no
And tell your little friends that you're rolling solo
Tonight boy make my body go...oh!
Lay it on me...

Lay it on me, put it down on me, oh
Put your hands on my body
Lay it on me, Lay it on me, now
Lay it on me...


I don't mind I can wait up,
Cause I'mma enjoy the ride
And I know when you show up, imma be satisfied
So come, come lay me down
One more time around
Boy just get me all that love tonight
And tell 'em you'll be here in the morning, oh no
And tell your little friends that you're rolling solo
Tonight boy make my body go...oh!
Lay it on me...


Lay it on me, baby

Lay it down, down, down, down
Lay it down, down, down, down
Lay it down, down, down, down...


The king of the Californian kings, you gotta call me sir
Watch me lay it down, and I ain't even tired
Puttin work in and I ain't even hired
Hittin' high notes, neighbors thought you joined the choir
She drop it, then wobbled it, cuz she know that I'm liking it
Turn my lap into a chauffeur, for I spend all day just ridin' it
Tryin' clone that, uh!, just to have a menage with it
Just a red light special, but I swear ain't no stopping this
Yellin' "Go, Sean, go, go!", so shorty bring it back
Call my dick curiosity â€™cause it killed the cat
And satisfaction brought it back
Girl it's your world, I'm just chillin' on the map.


Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, put it down on me, oh
Put your hands on my body
Lay it on me, Lay it on me, now
Lay it on me...
