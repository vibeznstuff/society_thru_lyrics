Another day is ended and I still can't sleep
Remembering my yesterdays, I begin to weep
If I could have it over live my life again
I wouldn't change a single day

I wish that I could turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to stop
Back to the days when life was so much better

Lying here in silence picture in my hand
Of a boy I still resemble but I no longer understand
And as the tears run freely, how I realise
They were the best years of my life

I wish that I could turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to stop
Back to the days when life was so much better

You might say it's just a case of giving up, no
But without these memories
Where is the love, so where is the love

If I could have it over, live my life again
I wouldn't change a single day

I wish that I could turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to stop
Back to the days when life was so much better

Why can't I turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to a stop
Back to the days oh, no, no
I remember when life was so good
I'd go back if I could

Oh, oh I wouldn't change a single day
Don't let the memories slip away
I wouldn't change a single day
Don't let the memories slip away, hey
