What's up with my heart when it skips a beat? (skips a beat)
Can't feel no pavement right under my feet (under my feet)

Up in my lonely room (my room)
When I'm dreaming of you
Oh, what can I do?
I still need you, but I don't want you now

When I'm down and my hands are tied (hands are tied)
I cannot reach a pen for me to draw the line (draw the line)
From this pain I just can't disguise (can't disguise)
It's gonna hurt but I'll have to say goodbye (say goodbye)

Up in my lonely room (my room)
When I'm dreaming of you
Oh, what can I do?
I still need you, but I don't want you now
Oh yeah 

Up in my lonely room (my room)
When I'm dreaming of you
Oh, what can I do?
I still need you, but I don't want you now
