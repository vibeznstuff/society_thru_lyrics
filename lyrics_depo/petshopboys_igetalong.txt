Feeling like I'm stuck in a hole body and soul while you're out of control 
Now I know why you had to go well I think we both know why ft had to be so 
I've been trying not to cry when 
I'm in the public eye stuck hare with the 
Same and taking

My share of the blame while making sudden plans that don't include you
I get along, get along
without you very well
I get along very well
Now I know you'd much refer be with rock royalty instead of someone like me the big boys are back and we needed
Them, you said

Think ft was something you'd read and it stuck in your head 
Even though I don't suppose that's as far as it goes 
You've got quite an appetite for being wronged and in the right well from now on ft won't affect me

I get along, get along
without you very well
I get along very well
The morning after the night before I'd been alerted
To your lies I phoned you up
Your calls were all diverted 
Took a long time to track you down even then you were defiant ft's not what you think it is, you said and proceeded to deny ft
So I lost my patience at last and it hampered so fast you belong in the past I've been trying not to cry when I'm in the public eye stuck here with the share and taking
My share of the blame while making sudden plans that don't include you
I get along, get along
without you very well
I get along very well
