There's a prophet on a mountain and he's making up dinner 
With long division and writing crop 
Anybody can feel like a winner 
When it's served up piping hot 

But the people aren't looking for a handout 
They're America's working corps 
Can this be what they voted for? 

Let them eat war 
That's how to ration the poor 
Let them eat war  

There's an urgent need to feed 
Declining pride

From the force to the union shops 
The war economy is making new jobs 
But the people who benefit most 
Are breaking bread with their benevolent hosts 

Who never stole from the rich to give to the poor 
All they ever gave to them was a war 
And a foreign enemy to deplore 

Let them eat war 
That's how to ration the poor 
Let them eat war  

There's an urgent need to feed 
Declining pride

We've got to kill 'em and eat 'em
Before they reach for their checks 
Squeeze some blue collars 
Let them bleed from their necks 
Seize a few dollars from the people who sweat 
Cause it's freedom or death and they won't question it 
At a job site the boss is god like 
Conditioned workhorses park at a stoplight 
Seasoned vets with their feet in nets 
A stones throw away from a rock fight 
But not tonight, feed ‘em death 

Here comes another ration (feed them death) 
Cause they're the finest in the nation (feed them death) 
When there's nothing left to feed them
When it's freedom or it's death 

Let them eat war  
That's how to ration the poor 
Let them eat war  

There's an urgent need to feed
