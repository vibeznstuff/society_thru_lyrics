Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well


My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the radio

Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screaming if I blow you with a bang

Suki Suki
I'm coming in the Cherokee gasoline
There's steam on the window screen
Take it, take it
Wheels bouncing like a trampoline
When I get to where I'm going, gonna have you trembling

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well


My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the radio

Yeah back it, back it
Yeah pull up to the bumper game
Read the signal
Cover me, cause I'm changing lanes

Had a handle on it
My life, I broke it
When I get to where I'm going, gonna have you saying it

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well


My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the radio


Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands high
Don't go screaming if I blow you with a bang

Going up to bitch I"ll see it for a million
Accelerating fast I could do this in a second
Looking in the rear view swagger going swell
Leaving boys behind cause it's legal just to kill
Shift gear automatic damned if I do
Who's gonna stop me when I'm coming through
What we got left is just me and you
But if I go to bed baby can I take you?

Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands high
Don't go screaming if I blow you with a bang

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well


My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the radio
