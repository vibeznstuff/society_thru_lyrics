Baby, are you down? 
Down, down
Even if the sky is fallin' down, down, down (oh)

You ought to know
Tonight is the night to let it go
Put on a show (show, show)
I wanna see how you lose control

So leave it behind 'cause we have a night to get away (away, away)
So come on and fly with me as we make our great escape (escape, escape)


So, baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry
Baby, are you down? 
Down, down
Baby, are you down? 
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling down

Just let it be
Come on and bring your body next to me
I'll take you away (ay)
Turn this place into our private getaway

So leave it behind 'cause we have a night to get away (away, away)
So come on and fly with me as we make our great escape
So why don't we run away




Down like she's suppose to be
She gets down low for me
Down like her temperature
'Cause to me she's zero degrees
She's cold, over freeze
I got that girl from overseas
Now she's my Miss America
Now can I be her soldier, please?
I'm fighting for this girl on the battlefield of love
Got me look like baby Cupid
Sending arrows from above
Don't you ever leave the side of me
And definitely, not probably
And honestly I'm down like that economy (Yeah)


So, baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only (oh)
No need to worry (oh)
Baby, are you down  (oh, the sky is falling down)
Down, down (oh, down)
Baby, are you down 
Down, down (oh, down) (the sky is falling down)
Even if the sky is falling down
Oh, oh, the sky is falling down
