First one it's a shock
A second helping not good enough
Third time lucky and you've arrived!
If you have any doubts then try once more...

Maybe I was too impressed...
He flattered I was blushing
He found my joie de vivre so cute and rather touching
Himself so upwardly mobile, so cerebral, clever
Could I ever live up to his dreams
Or would I like to play a part in his scheme?
I don't think so...

I have my plans and brave ambition
Knowing no bounds, no inhibitions
And I'm aware there's a lesson in every fall
So next time I'll get closer

First one it's a shock
A second helping not good enough
Third time lucky and you've arrived!
If you have any doubts then try one more time

Later I met a boy whose inner life was his true passion
We did connect in an exploratory fashion
He claimed what tie us to this mortal coil we should sever
Could I ever live up to his dreams
Or would I like to play a part in his scheme?
Oh I fear not...

I have my plans and brave ambition
Knowing no bounds, no inhibitions
And I'm aware there's a lesson in every fall
So next time I might get it right
