Don't look back
A new day is breakin'
It's been too long since I felt this way
I don't mind where I get taken
The road is callin'
Today is the day

I can see
It took so long just to realize
I'm much too strong
Not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down
I'll turn it around (Oh, yes I will)

I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'

It's a bright horizon and I'm awake now
Oh I see myself in a brand new way
The sun is shinin'
The clouds are breakin'
'Cause I can't lose now, there's no game to play

I can tell
There's no more time left to criticize
I've seen what I could not recognize
Everything in my life was leading me on
But I can be strong (Oh, yes I can)

I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
Far away and left behind (left behind)

Oh, the sun is shinin'
And I'm on that road

Don't look back
A new day is breakin'
It's been too long since I felt this way
I don't mind where I get taken
The road is callin'
Today is the day

I can see
It took so long just to realize
I'm much too strong
Not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down
I'll turn it around (Oh, yes I will)

I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
Far away and left behind

Don't look back
Don't look back
Don't look back
Don't look back
