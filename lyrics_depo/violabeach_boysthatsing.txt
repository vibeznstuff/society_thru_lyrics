She's a rhino
She's a whino
She's a tight rope
We'll be fine though
Singing woah
What do they know?
She's a Libra
And I need her
The Mona Lisa
Would want to be her
Singing woah
What do they know?

And she said that together we could take on the world
And she told me that I'll never find another girl like her

She's in Lycra
But I don't like her
She's a tiger
But not as violent
Singing woah
What do they know?
She's a weirdo
And a lido
She's a beer girl
And she's cheerful
Singing woah
What do they know?

And she said that together we could take on the world
And she told me that I'll never find another girl like her

And she said that together we could do anything
And she told me that she loves a boy who knows how to sing
So I learnt how to sing
