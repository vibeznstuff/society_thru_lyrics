Ooh, ooh
Ah, Rag doll ooh, ooh
Rag doll, ooh

(Hand me down)
When she was just a kid her clothes were hand-me-downs
(Hand me down)
They always laughed at her when she came into town

Called her Rag Doll
Little Rag Doll
Such a pretty face
Should be dressed in lace

Ooh, ooh
Ah, Rag doll ooh, ooh
Rag doll, ooh

(Shag rag doll)
I'd change her sad rags into glad rags if I could
(If I could)
My folks won't let me cause they say that she's no good

She's a rag doll
Such a rag doll
Though I love her so
I can't let her know

Ooh ooh
Ah, Rag doll
I love you just the way you are
Oh, Rag Doll, ooh
Oh, Rag Doll, ooh
