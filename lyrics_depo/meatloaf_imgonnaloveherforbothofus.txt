I can't stand to see it no more
The way you're living with a goddess but you treat her like a slave
And you can't hold her back anymore
She's like a dreamer in a dungeon or an angel in a cave


And I've been closer to you now than any other boy
And you know that what I'm saying is true
You're gonna break her up and tear her down and fade her away
And then there's no telling what I'm gonna do
I'll make you pay for everything that you do
I'll make you pay for everything that you do
But if you give me your girl, and then you give me your trust
And if you give me till the end of the night
I'm gonna love her for both of us
I'm gonna give her everything you always wanted to give
I'm gonna love her for both of us
I'm gonna take her every moment that she wanted to live
I'll let her shine like a jewel in the crown of the holy sun
You turned her into a ghost but she'll be burning when the night is done
I'll let her shine like a jewel in the crown of the holy sun
You turned her into a ghost but she'll be burning when the night is done
You gotta give me your girl and your trust
I'm gonna love her for both of us

You can't hide away anymore
You had a chance but you blew it and you'll never get it back
And your holiness was never so pure
She needs a fire in the heart and not a stabbing in the back



When the screws are tightnin' and the tears are falling
I can hear her crying out to be saved
And like a bolt of lightning I go answer the call
But she's singing like a siren to me over the waves
I never wanted to take away your lover
Until I heard her crying out to be saved
I always thought of you as one of my brothers
But she's singing like a siren to me over the waves
Singing like a siren to me over the waves
There ain't no holding me down!



I'll let her shine like a jewel in the crown of the holy sun
You turned her into a ghost but she'll be burning when the night is done
I'll let her shine like a jewel in the crown of the holy sun
You turned her into a ghost but she'll be burning when the night is done
You gotta give me your girl and your trust
I'm gonna love her for both of us

I'm gonna love her for both of us, I'm gonna love her for both of us
I'm gonna love her for both of us
(Gonna give her everything you always wanted to give)
I'm gonna love her for both of us
(Gonna take her every moment that she wanted to live)
I'm gonna love her for both of us
(Gonna give her everything you always wanted to give)
Repeat last block x3

I'm gonna love her for both of us
(Gonna take her every moment that she wanted to live)
I'm gonna lover her for both of us
(Gonna give her everything you always wanted to give)
