Baby, I like it when it feels this good
You always seem to make me smile
Can't nobody do what you do
When you love me just a little while

I, I know you got somewhere to go
And I got somewhere to be right now
I'll make 'em wait all day long
If you wanna get a little wild

I dont want to be a distraction to you
No no no
So maybe I'll just lay around
Play by myself
While touching on my favorite fruit
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Can't stop thinking bout the things we do
And how it feels making love to you
I'm ready to get it baby
If you got it to dish out
Just love me for a little while

I wanna make it like a dream for you
Turn every fantasy into the truth
You know I'll take it anywhere 
That you wanna go right now
Just to love ya for a little while

I, I like sleeping in your clothes
To smell you makes it all come down
When I think about me and you
Sometimes I get a little loud

Baby, I know we did it all night long
And I didn't wanna burn you out
Cause you know how much I like to do it
In the morning it's another round

I don't know if you have other things to do
No no no
So maybe I'll just lay around
Play by myself
While touching on my favorite fruit
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Can't stop thinking bout the things we do
And how it feels making love to you
I'm ready to get it baby
If you got it to dish out
Just love me for a little while

I wanna make it like a dream for you
And turn every fantasy into the truth
You know I'll take it anywhere 
That you wanna go right now
Just love ya for a little while

My passion flows like a river that has no end
I wanna know everything you'll let me do to you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Tell me what you like baby 
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Do you wanna play with my strawberries 
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Sometimes I think about me and you
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
I can get real loud (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)

Can't stop thinking bout the things we do
And how it feel making love to you
I'm ready to get it baby
If you got it to dish out
Just love me for a little while

I wanna make it like a dream for you
Turn every fantasy into the truth
You know I'll take it anywhere 
That you wanna go right now
Just to love ya for a little while

Just love me for a little while
