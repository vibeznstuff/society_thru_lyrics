Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I have seen you smile
At the accidental touch of my hand
A secret grin

There's a covert light in your eyes
When I walk in the room
Yeah, I caught you

Babe, you can't run from the truth
You cannot tell me a lie

'Cause girl you have to show me why
This is not our time
When all the evidence is sayin' that you're wrong
Somethin' is goin' on, yeah

I have felt my heart skip a beat
At the sound of your name
I turn away

You can read my bad poetry
That I've tried to erase
But it's written on my face

I cannot run from the truth
And I don't believe in lies

But girl, you have to show me why
This is not our time
When all the evidence is sayin' that you're wrong
Somethin' is goin' on

On top of some mountain
I'll scream it, I'll shout that
I love you, you love me
How can that be wrong?
Somethin' is goin' on, yes it is

Somethin' is goin' on
Somethin' is

I cannot run from the truth
And I don't believe in lies

But girl, you have to show me why
This thing will not work
When all the evidence is sayin' that you're wrong

Hey girl, you have to show me why
This is not our time
When all the evidence is sayin' that you're wrong, yeah
Somethin' is goin' on, yeah

You know it is
You know it is

Somethin' is goin' on
Somethin' is goin' on
You and me, babe

You know somethin' is goin'
Somethin' is, somethin' is
Somethin's going on, somethin' is
How can that be wrong?

'Cause somethin' is, somethin' is
Somethin' is goin' on
'Cause somethin' is goin' on
