Send me your location
Let's focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Place to come through

Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me,
This is new to you
Initially,
I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you,

So, don't take advantage,
Don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it

So, won't you send me your location
Let's focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through

Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets
So, let's keep personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you

I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide then
I might make you mine by the night then

Send me your location
Let's focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Place to come through

Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

Ride, ride, ride,
Come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
I don't need nothing else but you

Ride, ride, ride,
Come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
Nothing else but you

I don't need nothing else but you
