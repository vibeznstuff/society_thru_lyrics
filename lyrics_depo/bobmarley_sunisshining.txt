Sun is shining, the weather is sweet
Make you want to move your dancing feet
To the rescue, here I am
Want you to know, y'all, where I stand

(Monday morning)
Here I am
Want you to know just if you can
(Tuesday evening)
Where I stand
(Wednesday morning)
Tell myself a new day is rising
(Thursday evening)
Get on the rise, a new day is dawning
(Friday morning)
Here I am
(Saturday evening)
Want you to know just
Want you to know just where I stand

When the morning gathers the rainbow
Want you to know I'm a rainbow too
So, to the rescue, here I am
Want you to know just if you can
Where I stand
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

We'll lift our heads and give Jah praises
We'll lift our heads and give Jah praises, yeah

Sun is shining, weather is sweet
Make you want to move your dancing feet
To the rescue, here I am
Want you to know just if you can
Where I stand
No, no, no, no, where I stand

(Monday morning)
Scoo-ba doop scoop-scoop
(Tuesday evening)
Scoo-ba doop scoop-scoop
(Wednesday morning)
Scoo-ba doop scoop-scoop
(Thursday evening)
Scoo-ba doop scoop-scoop
(Friday morning)
Scoo-ba doop scoop-scoop

So, to the rescue
