Your love alone - is not enough not enough not enough
When times get tough they get tough they get tough they get tough

Trade all your heroes in for ghosts in for ghosts in for ghosts
They're always the one's that love you most love you most love you most

Your love alone - is not enough not enough not enough
It's what you felt it's what you said what you said what you said

You said the sky would fall on you fall on you fall on you
Through all the pain your eyes stayed Blue they stayed Blue Baby Blue

But your love alone won't save the world
You knew the secret of the universe
Despite it all you made it worse
It left you lonely it left you cursed

You stole the sun straight from my heart from my heart from heart
With no excuses just fell apart fell apart fell apart

No you won't make a mess of me mess of me mess of me
For you're as blind as a man can be man can be man can be

I could have seen for miles and miles
I could have made you feel alive
I could have placed us in exile
I could have shown you how too cry

Your love alone is not enough
Your love alone is not enough
