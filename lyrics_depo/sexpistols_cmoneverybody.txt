Well c'mon everybody and let's get together tonight
I got some money in my jeans
And I'm really gonna spend it right
Well I've been doin' my homework all week long
Now to have some fifty and my folk are gone
Ooh! C'mon everybody

Well, my baby's number one
But I'm gonna dance with three or four
And the house will be shakin' from the bare feet
A-stampin' on the floor

Well when you here the music and you can't still
If your brother won't rock then your sister will
Ooh! C'mon everybody

Well, we're really gonna party
But we gotta leave a guard outside
If my folks come home
I'm afraid they're gonna have my hide
Well, there'd be no more movies for a week or two
No more runnin' 'round with the usual crew - who cares?
C'mon everybody!
