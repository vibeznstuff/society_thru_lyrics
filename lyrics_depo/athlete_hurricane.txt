All the places we grew up,
We're playing hide and seek,
Disappearing wall when you'll sleep

Is it something we gotta get used to?
Is it something we gotta get used to? whoa.

Hurricane. 
Oh hurricane.

All the millions that we marched with
It never made a sound, never made a sound on your lips.

Is it something we gotta get used to?
But we're not giving up the coastline so easily.

Oh hurricane.
Oh hurricane.

I don't wanna run,
I've been here since I was young
Whoa this city day could be gone within the hour.

Oh hurricane, what you gonna do to us this time?
Oh hurricane, what you gonna do to us this time?

Oh hurricane!

Is it something we gotta get used to?

And it's something we gotta get used to..
And we're not giving up the coastline so easily.

Oh hurricane!
