AII I need
get my share
Of someone's tender loving care.
But there are people
people ev'rywhere
Whose hearts are broken beyond repair.
You took your choice from the display
Wrapped me up
took home to play.
When love ran out
threw me away

Cost more to mend than you would pay.

I feel used and confused 
You know I do
you know I do
you know I do.
I'm no freak
I'm not unique

I'm not alone but noone really cares.

I'm just another broken heart

I'm just another broken heart

I'm just another broken heart

I'm just another broken heart

I'm just another broken heart.

You feels like I was loaned to you

A library book you won't renew.
A card arrived
you're overdue

You get replaced by someone new.

I feel foiled and shopsoiled 
You know do
you know do
you know do. 
You made me a refugee

I'm not alone but noone really cares.

I'm just another broken heart
I feel used and confused 
I'm just another broken heart
