Ritual union’s got me in trouble again
I was wonderin’ of a white dress
And the mistress
And a spirit holding my hand!

Love’s sinking in the sand
Petals falling on demand
My feet are running like the wind
I’m sorry, boy that we sinned
Love is not like they say
A lie, that it’s hard to make it stay
It drowns my feelings in the sea
I dried out over on the beach

Ritual union’s got me in trouble again
I was wonderin’ of a white dress
And the mistress
And a spirit holding my hand!

Father, tell me how it is
I know you’ve been through all of this
You ran away so many times
Your kid, your heart, a couple of dimes
Love is not like they say
A lie, that it’s hard to make it stay
It drowns my feelings in the sea
I dried up over on the beach

Ritual union’s got me in trouble again
I was wonderin’ of a white dress
And the mistress
And a spirit holding my hand!

Ritual union’s got me in trouble again
I was wonderin’ of a white dress
And the mistress
And a spirit holding my hand!
