If you see me walking down the street,
Staring at the sky and dragging my two feet,
You just pass me by,
It still makes me cry but you can make me whole again.

And if you see me with another man laughing and joking doing what I can,
I won't put you down, 'cause I want you around,
'cause you can make me whole again.


Looking back on when we first met,
I can not escape and I can not forget,
Baby, you are the one
You still turn me on,
You can make me whole again.

Time is laying heavy on my heart
Seems I've got too much of it since we've been apart,
My friends make me smile if only for Â while,
You can make me whole again.



For now I'll have to wait,
But, baby, if you change your mind don't be too late,
'cause I just can't go on,
It's already been too long,
But you can make me whole again.

Wooooooooooooooooooooooo



Ooh, baby, you're the one,
You still turn me on,
But you can make me whole again.
