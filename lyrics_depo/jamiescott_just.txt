Sometimes I feel life's done me wrong
Embraced a man without a heart
Why do I feel like I'm running round
Scared cos my feet just wont touch the ground
What do I pray for at night 
A chance to feel what its like

A little peace baby
A little love baby

And I just 
No I just don't understand 
Why people wanna hurt me so 
And I just 
No I just don't understand 
But I'm free until the morning comes

A book by which we live our lives 
A way to know our wrong from rights
Why do I feel like I do
I wish I felt just like you god knows

A little peace baby
A little love baby
A little peace baby
A little love baby

And I just 
No I just don't understand 
Why people wanna hurt me so 
And I just 
No I just don't understand 
But I'm free until the morning comes

Yes I know oh I know it was you that carried me 
Oh it's true what they say life is full of misery
But this much I have learnt won't let fear conquer me yeah
