In this crazy life we reach for the best we can 
But sometimes it slips away
no matter how we plan 
You were the best thing in my life 
My only hope of gettin' it right 
Who would've thought we'd get to have
A second time around?
But now that love is on our side again 
Let's take these feelings all the way
Let's open up and live our passions to the end 
Now that love is on our side again
I loved you too much, without you I felt so wrong 
It's funny how we tear ourselves apart, just to belong 
I'll never ever compromise that look of trust within your eyes 
We'll let our hearts grow forever here on solid ground.

Now that love is on our side again 
Let's take these feelings all the way 
Let's open up and live our passions to the end 
Now that love is on our side again
Now here we are, and the storm is over 
We're ready for that dream 
We'll get it right 
It just could take a little longer 
A time to heal our wounds is all we need
Now that love is on our side again 
Let's take these feelings all the way 
Let's open up and live our passions to the end
Now that love is on our side again 
Now that love is on our side again 
Let's take these feelings all the way 
Let's open up and live our passions to the end
Now that love is on our side again.
