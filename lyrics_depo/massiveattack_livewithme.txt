Woo, hoo

It don't matter when you turn
Gonna survive
You live and learn
I've been thinkin' about you, baby
By the light of dawn

A midnight blue, day and night
I've been missing you
I've been thinkin' about you, baby
Almost makes me crazy
Come and live with me

Either way, win or lose
When you're born into trouble
You live the blues
I've been thinkin' about you, baby
See it almost makes me crazy

Times, nothing's right, if you ain't here
I'll give all that I have just to keep you near
I wrote you a letter, I tried to make it clear
That you just don't believe that I'm sincere
I've been thinking about you, baby
Woo, hoo, hoo

Plans and schemes
Hopes and fears
Dreams that deny for all these years
I, I've been thinkin' about you, baby
Living with me, wow

I've been thinkin' about you, baby
Makes me wanna
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Times, nothing's right, if you ain't here
I'll give all that I have just to keep you near
I wrote you a letter, darling tried to make it clear
But you just don't believe that I'm sincere

I've been thinkin' about you, baby
I want you to live with me, wow
I've been thinkin' about you, baby
I want you to live with me
