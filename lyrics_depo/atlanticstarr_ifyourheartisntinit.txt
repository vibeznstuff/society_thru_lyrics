It's a fragile situation
It could fall apart at any time
And none would be the wiser
Except you and I

It seems that we stopped talkin'
Like we're afraid to disagree
And after all we've been through
Can we still be that naive?

If your heart isn't in it
Why can't you tell me so?
If my heart wasn't in it
I'd have gone long ago
If your heart isn't in it
Why keep me hangin' on?
Just tell me and I'll be gone
From your life

You treat me like a stranger
As if I wasn't there
Oh baby, I waited for a miracle
To make you show that you care

If your heart isn't in it
Why can't you tell me so?
If my heart wasn't in it
I'd have gone long ago
If your heart isn't in it
Why keep me hangin' on?
Just tell me and I'll be gone
From your life

If your heart isn't in it
Why can't you tell me so?
I can't go through the motions
I have to know
If your heart isn't in it
Why can't you tell me so?
I can't go to the limit
I have to know

If your heart
Ooh, can't you tell me so?
I have to know
If your heart isn't it
Why keep me hangin' on?
Just tell me and I'll be gone
Don't keep me hangin' on
For dear life
