Take me downtown
It's where the people rock,
Three-hundred sixty five days we never stop.

Take me downtown
Cos' peoples runnin' wild.
See how we kick it in a brand new style.

Take me downtown
It's where I wanna go.
Everyone I know is going to my show-

Take me downtown
Where the city hum,
Then get your head numb to the beat of the drum cause,


I see you watching me watching you,
And now you see just where you gotta be.
I see you watching me watching you,
And now you see just where you gotta be.


Take me downtown
Cause baby wants to rock.
I need a little edge with my electro-pop

Take me downtown
So everybody sees
I know my moves like my ABCs

Take me downtown
It's time we made it right
This show ain't going nowhere we'll just party all night

Take me downtown
Where the city hum,
Then get your head numb to the beat of the drum.




Baby rock, never stop,
Round and round the clock.

Lover's rock, give it up,
Never, never stop.

Baby rock, get on top,
Take it take it all.

I'm not the kind of girl, who's scared of you at all cause,

I see you watching me watching you,
I see you watching me watching you ROCK!
