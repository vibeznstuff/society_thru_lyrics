An insolent speck of youth
Being taken for a walk
So tightly by the ear
So that he can hardly talk

Yesterday's men hang on to today
To sing in the old fashioned way
It must get better in the long run
Has to get better in the long run

A metropolitan marathon
Has been held today
But who you need to catch
Will be coming the other way

Yesterday's men hang on to today
To sing in any old way
It must get better in the long run
Has to get better in the long run

Because when you're told to start how far can you go?
When your race is run and you already know
Because when you're told to stop how far will you go?
When your race is run and you already know

Yesterday's men hang on to today
To sing in any old way
It must get better in the long run
Has to get better in the long run
Will it get better in the long run?
Will we be here in the long run?

Yesterday's men hang on to today
To sing in any old way
It must get better in the long run
Has to get better in the long run
Will it get better in the long run?
Will we be here in the long run?
Hang on in the long run
