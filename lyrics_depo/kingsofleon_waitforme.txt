Gonna open my heart
Right at the scars
Listen up
Gonna do what I'm told
Go where I'm told
And listen up
Take a shot in the rain
Walk for the pain
And listen up

I tried all the way...
Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me

Gonna soften the blow
Soften the blow
And give it up
I saw the surprise
The look in your eyes
I gave it up
Gonna be who I am
Be who I am
And give it up

I tried all the way...
Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
Ah, it's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
Ah, it's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me

It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
Ah, it's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
Oh, it's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
Oh, it's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
