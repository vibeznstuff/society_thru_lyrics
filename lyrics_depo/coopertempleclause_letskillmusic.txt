We dare you to mean a single word you say 
Feel free if you've time to try and change our minds 
You might wanna duck before you lose your head 
It seems we're the ones who's got the guts to bleed 
It's not number one who will come out alive 
It's the freak in the corner with his eyes on fire 
Let's kill music before it kills us all
