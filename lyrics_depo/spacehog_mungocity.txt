Welcome to this empty ministry of plenty
As I'm sure you know
We're clearly on display here
To remind you should you stray from here
Or decide to roam

Dossers dream of gossamer
And kissing with tongues
Well, they're falling in love with anyone
Races from all places though all from under one sun,
Well it sure was no fun
So I got up and ran, ran, ran, from Mungo City

Mungo City, where are you?
You make us grey when skies are blue
That Mungo City, in the sky
Keeps a watchful eye on you and I

(Well) Don't think you're even thinking
Even though you're thinking: keep it underground
They're sending out distress codes
And playing with your mind though
You won't hear a sound

Nazis in the Japanese cars from Japan
Well, they're falling in love if only they can
I'm telling you the tribesman wouldn't stand for this, man
Will, it sure was no scam
So I got up and ran, ran, ran from Mungo City

Mungo City, where are you?
You make us grey when skies are blue
That Mungo City, in the sky
Keeps a watchful eye on you tonight

Mungo City, where are you?
You make us grey when skies are blue
Mungo City, in the sky
Keeps a watchful eye on you tonight

Mungo City, where are you?
You make us grey when skies are blue
Mungo City, in the sky
Keeps a watchful eye on you tonight

Mungo City, where are you?
You make us grey when skies are blue
Mungo City, in the sky
Keeps a watchful eye on you tonight

Mungo City, where are you?
You make us grey when skies are blue

Mungo City, where are you?
You make us grey when skies are blue

Mungo City, where are you?
You make us grey when skies are blue
