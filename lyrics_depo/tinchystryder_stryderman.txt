She's like oh there's Stryderman
Top east London writer man
If anyone can then Stryder can
Work through on the whip like Spiderman
She's like oh that Stryderman
Top east London writer man
If anyone can then Stryder can
Work through on the whip like Spiderman


Hi it's me again
Tell them it's Stryder
The girlfriend taker
The boyfriends hate me
All I gotta do is drop a double one liner
And if not minor the necklace will blind her
The other dudes can't do it like me
Prada boots with the new Armani
Look, man are on a hype,
Like watch when I see him.
But when I go come, there like kamikaze
Girls like paper, but I'm a raider
But I'm on ya telly so it makes things easier
And it's so obvious we do this major
From the whip to the gun, I'm sweat-ain her
Look pie-hater don't get mad
Cause I got your girl webbed up quick like a spider
Don't get close to my goons means danger
Don't get clocked on the radar




Yeah, I do things my way
Oh that's the bow way
E3 free again, yep make da way
Yep line the bars like laps and drakes hallway
So I guarantee like always
And I've been locking down girls from school days
Cause I've been a star in the hood from school raves
I got the girls they lovin' it
Can't get enough of it, learned
That from my old cool tape
Shes like oh there's Stryderman
And I've been a top east London writer man
Look whys your man tryna see me man
He can't see me man cause I'm a ninja man
You chase girls and ladies chase us
But when them black throw mans it on trust
Look real talk I ain't tryin' to start up a fuss
But real G's don't need luck




Strydes
I got my swagger and chicks like always
Strydes
I got my swagger and chicks like always
Get me, Yo!
She wants me, I know this
Gimme one week and I'll lock this
I'll have her mind lost like mazes
And I'm sayin' it large but conk this
But I kick back, chill, I got my mind straight
I'm sick with the rhyming
Ills, I'll carry on doin' what I'm doin'
That girls like


She's like oh there's Stryderman
Top east London writer man
If anyone can then Stryder can
Work through on the whip like Spiderman
She's like oh that Stryderman
Top east London writer man
If anyone can then Stryder can
Work through on the whip like Spiderman
