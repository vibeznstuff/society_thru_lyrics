Way, way down inside honey, you need it,
I'm gonna give you my love... I'm gonna give you my love.



You've been coolin', baby, I've been droolin',
All the good times I've been misusin',
Way, way down inside, I'm gonna give you my love,

Gonna give you my love.

Shake for me, girl. I wanna be your backdoor man.
