Just you know why
Why you and I
Will bye and bye
Know true love ways

Sometimes we'll sigh,
sometimes we'll cry
and we'll know why just you and I know true love ways.

Though out the days, I'll true love ways.
Will bring us joys to share with those who really care.

Sometimes we'll sigh,
sometimes we'll cry
and we'll know why just you and I know true love ways.

Though out the days, I'll true love ways.
Will bring us joys to share with those who really care.

Sometimes we'll sigh,
sometimes we'll cry
and we'll know why just you and I know true love ways.
