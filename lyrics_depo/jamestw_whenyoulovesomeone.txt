Come home early after class
Don't be hanging 'round the back
Of the schoolyard
I've been called up by your teacher
She said she can't even reach you
'cause you're so far

You've been talking with your fist
We didn't raise you up like this,
Now did we?
There've been changes in this house
Things that you don't know about
In this family

It don't make sense, but nevertheless
You gotta believe us, it's all for the best
It don't make sense
The way things go
Son you should know

Sometimes moms and dads fall out of love
Sometimes two homes are better than one
Some things you can't tell your sister 'cause she's still too young
Yeah, you'll understand
When you love someone

There ain't no one here to blame
And nothing's going to change
With your old friends
Your room will stay the same
'Cause you'll only be away
On the weekends

It don't make sense, but nevertheless
You gotta believe us, it's all for the best
It don't make sense
It don't add up
But we'll always love you no matter what

Sometimes moms and dads fall out of love
Sometimes two homes are better than one
Some things you can't tell your sister 'cause she's still too young
Yeah, you'll understand
When you love someone
When you love someone

Come home early after class
Don't be hanging around the back
Of the schoolyard
And if we're crying on the couch
Don't let it freak you out
It's just been so hard

Sometimes moms and dads fall out of love
Sometimes the best intentions just ain't enough
Some things you can't tell your sister 'cause she's still too young
Yeah, you'll understand
When you love someone
When you love someone
When you love someone
When you love someone
