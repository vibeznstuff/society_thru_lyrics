We cut the cake, everybody danced, and some people drank too much.
You looked like the cover, of a bride's magazine, and I looked like some guy in a tux.
I'll never forget, when your Uncle Bill, pulled up a chair and sat down,
And said "Son I've been married now 45 years, " and he pointed at you through the crowd,

And said

"Love her like she's leaving,
Like it's all gonna end, if you don't.
Love her like she's leaving,
Oh and I guarantee, she won't."

He said "It's sending her flowers, for no reason at all. And notes on the fridge every day.
An unexpected gift, at an unexpected time, that keeps the lawyers away.
And it's easy to take forever for granted, with tin cans tied to your car.
And I know she tells you that she'll always be there, but I'm telling you if you're smart, "

"You'll love her like she's leaving,
Like all it's gonna end, if you don't.
Love her like she's leaving,
Oh and I guarantee, she won't."

"Yeah, she could have any man she wants, you know it's true.
Best way to keep her, is to keep her wanting you."

"Love her like she's leaving
Oh and I guarantee she won't."

"Yeah, I guarantee she won't."
