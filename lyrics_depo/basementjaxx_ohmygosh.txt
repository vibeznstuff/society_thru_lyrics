See that boy just standing over there
He stopped me today said he liked my hair.... Ooh 
He asked me where you going tonight....
(err) and I said I'm with my girls... (yea A was on the run) 
To tell you the truth he was just a lil bit........ fresh 
He said he liked the way I put my lipstick.... on 
He said how many sugars do you like in your tea? (umm) 
I said forget about the sugar have a spoon full of me, 
'Cause I taste so sweet!


Oh my gosh He's making eyes at me and I don't mind at all 
Oh my gosh He's making my imagination run w-wild 

Listen to this yea 
There I was with a drink in my hand 
No cares in the world didn't have a plan 
I turned around and I caught his eye 
He made me lose my concentration 

Did you get his number? No 
Did you get his name? ummm 
What score would you give him on a scale of 1 to 10? 
I didn't get his number. (I didn't get his number) 
I don't know his name. 
But I think he's hot y'no and I think he is a 10 


Oh my gosh He's making eyes at me and I don't mind at all 
Oh my gosh He's making my imagination run w-wild 
(no no no no no no no) 
Oh my gosh He's making eyes at me and I don't mind at all 
Oh my gosh He's making my imagination run w-wild 
(no no no no no no no) 

Chinese eyes 
Ice cube lips 
Feel it in da eyes

From your head to your feet
