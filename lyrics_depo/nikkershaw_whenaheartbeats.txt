Halfway to paradise
Or so it seems that way
Same as anyone
Same as any other day

We seek eternity
In all the things we buy
Not top priority
But it sure figures very high

Who steals the real world
Fooling us all as we go
And who gets to heaven
Heaven only knows

When a heart beats, you can see forever
When our time sleeps, you can be forever

Meanwhile in cuckoo land
A most delightful place
We look no further than
The nose in front of our face

No wood anywhere
We can only see trees
Last train for
Material refugees

When a heart beats, you can see forever
When our time sleeps, you can be forever

Don't concern yourself
With matters past and future
Just put your mind to where they meet
But when a heart beats
Fooling us all as we go
Who gets to heaven
Heaven knows

When a heart beats, you can see forever
When a heart beats, you can be forever

Be forever
