I ain't easy
And I make you mad
Least I ain't sleazy
I'm just trying to put the world to right
If you want to, I'll take you out
And I got the feeling that I'm gonna keep you up all
Gonna keep you up all
Gonna keep you up all night

Tired of taking orders
Coping with disorders
The wrong men have the power
It's turning my milk sour
We're tired of taking orders
Coping with disorders
The wrong men have the power
It's turning my milk sour
Turning my milk sour
Turning my milk sour

I ain't easy
And I make you mad
Least I ain't sleazy
I'm just trying to put the world to rights
And if you want to, I'll take you out
Cause I got the feeling that I'm gonna keep you up all night

I ain't easy
But I ain't that bad
No rhyme or reason, I'm just trying to set the world alight
You got problems, well so have I
And I got the feeling that I'm gonna keep you up all
Gonna keep you up all
Gonna keep you up all night

There's cobras in the moshpit
Finally we lost it
Everyday is brutal
Now we're being watched by Google
Gotta keep it simple
Sending out a signal
Everyday is brutal
Now we're being watched by Google
Being watched by Google
Being watched by Google

I ain't easy
And I make you mad
Least I ain't sleazy
I'm just trying to put the world to rights
And if you want to, I'll take you out
Cause I got the feeling that I'm gonna keep you up all night

I ain't easy
But I ain't that bad
No rhyme or reason, I'm just trying to set the world alight
You got problems, well so have I
And I got the feeling that I'm gonna keep you up all
Gonna keep you up all
Gonna keep you up all night
