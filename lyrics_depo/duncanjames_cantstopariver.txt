Gone are the days of my mistakes, 
I'd give everything, if everything is what it takes. 
I'll bring the sun and I would chase 
the rain, if I needed to. 
But those many ways of mine, but 
I've been down that road so many 
Times. 
And if you depend upon me, then 
Maybe you'll see. 


You can't stop the river from flowing 
To the sea. 
Cos some things just happen, like 
They're meant to be. 
And it doesn't matter where you are, 
Or where you go, or what you do. 
You can't stop my heart from loving you. 

There is a dream I keep alive., 
Wonderful and heavenly standing by 
Your side. 
Bringing you all the colours love can 
Spare just to be with you. 
And there maybe times when i 
Should have been there to hold you 
Through the night. 
And if you depend upon me, then 
Maybe you'll see. 


I've been miles away but I'm paying 
My dues, 
But don't worry I wont blame you for 
A minute, no way no. 
I wont blame you this time, please.
