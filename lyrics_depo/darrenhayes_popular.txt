I've gotta plan to make it rich, and famous.
Lucky for me for you it's a bitch you ain't in.
My plans are slowly changin'
Fame is so contagious.

I'm willin' to sleep my way to the top,
I wanna be popular.
I don't wanna keep my feet on the ground,
I wanna be popular.

I must confess I've been a very bad boy, 
Been sleeping around, talk of the town.
My name is. . . 
Hollywood will beckon.
Everyone will listen.

Play my video, hear me on the radio.
Dancing to the disco, no-one ever says no.

I'm willin' to sleep my way to the top,
I wanna be popular.
I don't wanna keep my feet on the ground,
I wanna be popular.

I'm willin' to sleep my way to the top,
I wanna be popular.
I don't wanna keep my feet on the ground,
I wanna be popular.

My friends are all in limousines.
My friends are all celebrity.

Play my video, hear me on the radio.
Dancing to the disco, no-one ever says no.

I'm willin' to sleep my way to the top,
I wanna be popular.
I don't wanna keep my feet on the ground,
I wanna be popular.
I'm willin' to sleep my way to the top,
I wanna be popular.
I don't wanna keep my feet on the ground,
I wanna be popular.

My friends are all celebrity.
My friends are all in magazines.

I'm willin' to sleep my way to the top,
I wanna be popular.
I don't wanna keep my feet on the ground,
I wanna be popular.
Are you willin' to sleep your way to the top,
Do you wanna be popular?
