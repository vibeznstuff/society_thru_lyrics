Ya lookin' just a little too hard at me
Standin' just a little too close to me
Ya sayin not quite enough to me
Ya sippin' just a little too slow for me
No doubt ya playin' real cool homie
Got me thinkin' what is it you do for me
Trippin' (trippin')  a little more than I should be
So let ya self go and get right with me


I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get

I'm about to fill your cup, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get riiiiiiight toniiiiiiight, we can get right
Do you want more? 


Ya lips talkin' bout I play too much
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants
My hips movin' oh so slow
Bar tab lookin like a car note
All I need is you here right by my side
Take whatever ya want, baby let's ride
And whatever ya won't do let me decide.
Just put ya name on the dotted line


I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get

But so little time
And if tonight ain't long enough
Don't leave love behind (Don't leave love behind)
Take my hand, I'll show you why
