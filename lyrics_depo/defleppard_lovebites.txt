If you've got love in your sights 
Watch out, love bites 

When you make love, do you look in the mirror? 
Who do you think of, does he look like me? 
Do you tell lies and say that it's forever? 
Do you think twice, or just touch 'n' see? 
Ooh babe ooh yeah 

When you're alone, do you let go? 
Are you wild 'n' willin' or is it just for show? 
Ooh c'mon 

I don't wanna touch you too much baby 
'Cos making love to you might drive me crazy 
I know you think that love is the way you make it 
So I don't wanna be there when you decide to break it 
No! 

Love bites, love bleeds 
It's bringin' me to my knees 
Love lives, love dies 
It's no surprise 
Love begs, love pleads 
It's what I need 

When I'm with you are you somewhere else? 
Am I gettin' thru or do you please yourself? 
When you wake up will you walk out? 
It can't be love if you throw it about 
Ooh babe 

I don't wanna touch you too much baby 
'Cos making love to you might drive me crazy 



 

Ooh yeah 



Love bites, love bleeds 
It's bringin' me to my knees 
Love lives, love dies 



If you've got love in your sights 
Watch out, love bites 
Yes it does 
It will be hell
