Welcome to the world, welcome to the world 

You got your popstar, ill be your rockstar 
When it's a suicide, you call it superstar 
Check out the forecast, predictions wont stop 
You get your fifteen, and then they take the spot 

Lets go, lets go 
And then youre ready to go 
Lets go lets go 
Cause it's the end of the show 
Lets go lets go 
So just get ready to go 
Lets go lets go 
Lets go lets go 

All the time that you were gone, 
I thought about how things went wrong 
Now youre coming down to earth 
Ok, hello, welcome to the world 

She saw the bright lights 
She caught the fever 
She got contagious 
She never leave it 
So no more time spent 
And no more free shit 
In fact this free ride has reached its destination 

Lets go, lets go 
And then youre ready to go 
Lets go lets go 
Cause it's the end of the show 
Lets go lets go 
And when its over, youll know 
Lets go lets go 
Lets go lets go 

All the time that you were gone, 
I thought about how things went wrong 
Now youre coming down to earth 
Ok, hello, (welcome to my world) welcome to the world 

Lifes a tour, im so sure 
The ex will come before you exit girl 
No more games, I confess 
Far from lane im just so fresh 
While cubit lee ??, it's the big boss 
You get on the block, mr Rudolf 
Kevin! 2 stars, hold your applause 
Hold it down to yalls all guitars 
Half my life I sacrifice 
But I only came to party tonight 
New chicks, get my drinks up 
Every weekend we can link up 
New rings, with the big cuts 
Only be the best sport, get your mix up 
I took my time she love me, me such 
When she closes her eyes its what she thinks of 
Boss 

All the time that you were gone, 
I thought about how things went wrong 
Now youre coming down to earth 
Ok, hello, welcome to the world 

Welcome to the world, welcome to the world, welcome to the world, welcome to the world
