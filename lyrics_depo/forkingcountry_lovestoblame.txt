Time and time
I've thought through it all
How we loved and laughed
And how we fought each other,
Pushing one another to be somebody else

And time and time
I've wrestled my thoughts
Uncertain if the end was right or wrong,
And whether we still should be together
Or with somebody else

Our last memory,
She had water in her eyes
She cried, "Stay with me!"
And asked, "How can this be love if you're leaving me?"
But darling, love's to blame

And I can't see you right now
'Cause I just can't fake it
Can't be near you right now
'Cause I know you're no longer mine
I can't see you

It makes me ache
That we had to break
And even though I knew your heart so well
We're strangers in different places
Though we live a mile apart

My best friend's gone,
My world has been torn
We'll never share a name
Never be one
But I will always remember the years we spent in love

I still think of you
I pray that you are safe
I'm still missing you
But it has to be this way
'Cause I'm not right for you
And that's why love's to blame

And I can't see you right now
'Cause I just can't fake it
Can't be near you right now
'Cause I know you're no longer mine
And I can't see you right now
'Cause I just can't take it
Can't be near you right now
'Cause I know you're no longer mine
And I can't see you
No, I can't see you
I just can't see you right now

Maybe time will heal our hearts
Maybe after time you'll understand
I said goodbye but I love you

And I can't see you right now
'Cause I just can't fake it
Can't be near you right now
'Cause I know you're no longer mine
And I can't see you right now
'Cause my heart just can't take it
Can't be near you right now
'Cause I know you're no longer mine
And I can't see you
No, I can't see you
I just can't see you right now

And I can't see you
No, I can't see you
I just can't see you right now

And love's to blame
