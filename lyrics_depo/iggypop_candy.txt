It's a rainy afternoon
In 1990
The big city geez it's been 20 years-
Candy-you were so fine

Beautiful beautiful
Girl from the north
You burned my heart
With a flickering torch
I had a dream that no one else could see
You gave me love for free

candy, candy , Candy I can't let you go
All my life you're haunting me
I loved you so

Candy, candy , Candy I can't let you go
Life is crazy
Candy baby

Yeah, well it hurt me real bad when you left
I'm glad you got out
But I miss you
I've had a hole in my heart
For so long
I've learned to fake it and
Just smile along

Down on the street
Those men are all the same
I need a love
Not games
Not games


Candy, Candy, Candy I can't let you go
All my life you're haunting me
I loved you so
Candy, Candy , Candy I can't let you go
Life is crazy
I Know baby
Candy baby

UOU UOU UOU
Candy, Candy, Candy I can't let you go
All my life you're haunting me
I loved you so

CANDY CANDY CANDY
life is crazy
candy baby

candy baby,
candy, candy
