Oooooh baby, Not tonight
I don't wanna fuss n fight
I just wanna make it right
Ooh, ooh there's work to do
I wanna get real close to you
I wanna get you in the mood

All the things you want to do
Just relax and I'll take care of you

And anytime you want me
I'm sayin that I love you every day
And I know that you love me
Baby, admit it


Give me all your love and don't stop
My love's waiting when you reach the top
(All night long)
Come into my bedroom honey
What I got will make you spend money
(All night long)

You know that I know that you love me
So if you just give me a chance
I can still show you romance
I know that you still savin' for
My flavor babe
So stop playin' hard to get
Let's make love like we first met

All the things you want to do
Just relax and I'll take care of you
And anytime you want me
I'm sayin that I love you everyday
And I know that you love me
Baby, mm baby



And I'll say
Shoo do do do do do do do doo
shoo do do do do do do do doo
shoo do do do do do do doo do do doo do do doooo
