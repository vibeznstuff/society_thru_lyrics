Last time I saw her she was running
Laughing swirling high above the ground
People stop and check and watch her coming
Crazy little mama going round and round
Last time I touched her she was burning
Through a heat of ever lasting light
Drifting through her fires my ceaseless yearning
Flaming little mama will you burn all night
Hey, will you burn all night
Hey will you burn all night

The first time I kissed her I surrendered
Hands reached for the sky no disgrace
Safe inside my love so warm and tender
Movin little mama it's your place
Ooh moving little mama
Oh will you burn all night
Mmm will you burn all night

Will you
Will you burn all night
Oh can you burn all night

Last time I saw her she was running
Rollin tumble fall on the ground
Mama always said she's got it coming
Crazy little mama keep your dresses down

Crazy little mama, Crazy
Crazy little mama
