The game we play is life and death
Your worth measured in dollars and in cents
There ain't no lifeline coming (coming!)
Unless you pay the price (the price!)
Your hope, freedom, your sanity
A product, not a right

These are the days that test your heart and soul
Strap yourself in for the American Fall
Day after day it is all crash and burn
A nation hijacked by the criminals

Whoa oh oh, whoa oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh
Yeah

Your neighbor is your enemy
Your real friends are on the TV
They’re selling lies and self-loathing
Nothing no one should pay to be

The cost of healthcare, the cost of guns
The cost of knowledge, the cost of love
When prison is an industry
Somebody’s getting locked away

Uninvited to the party
They're cold, afraid and starving
There's gotta be more
To the millions who are marching
Than a separation of just a few degrees
Between evil, famine and the disease

These are the days that test your heart and soul
Strap yourself in for the American Fall
Day after day it is all crash and burn
A nation hijacked by the criminals

Whoa oh oh, whoa oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh

Reject the criminality
That monetizes our humanity
Construct a new reality
Where you're not just a number, you're a name

We'll never have our dignity
Till all you fascists are six feet deep
