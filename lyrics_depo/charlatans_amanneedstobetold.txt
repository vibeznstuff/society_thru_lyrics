A man needs to be told there is a world going on
There is a world going on
There is a world going on
A man needs to be told to look into the night
He will get lost in the day
He will get lost in the night
A man needs to be told
A man needs to be told
A man needs to be told
A man needs to be told

A young boy once told me
I will be an old man and I am only 15
It wasn't part of the plan
It wasn't part of the dream
Ever wonder how much the man who wrote "White Christmas" made?
How evolution began
The revolution was fake
A man needs to be told
A man needs to be told
A man needs to be told
A man needs to be told

A man needs to be told
A man needs to be told
A man needs to be told
A man needs to be told

A man needs to be told there is a war going on
There is a war going on
There is a war going on
A man needs to be told there is a truth in his eye
There is a rest in the dawn
There is a point to his life
A man needs to be told
A man needs to be told
A man needs to be told
A man needs to be told

A man needs to be told
A man needs to be told
A man needs to be told
A man needs to be told
