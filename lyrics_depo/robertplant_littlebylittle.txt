Little by little, my heart green
Little by little, I call your name
Little by little, my tears fall
Little by little, everything changes

Little by little, the time goes
Little by little, the days pass by
Little by little, the air clears
Little by little, I can breathe again
I can breathe again --

Back at the mirror - your good friend
Talk to the mirror, but play out your game
Sat in the middle, I stop then
Look at the winner, and the price you pay

Close the window - I tremble
Love was a fall that had no end
Now little by little - the air clears
Little by little, I can breathe again
I can breathe again --

I call your name - I call your name
I call your name - I call your name
Everything changes - everything changes
I call your name
I can breathe again --
