Whispering in his ear,
my magic potion for love,
telling him, I'm sicere,
and that there's nothing too good for us.

And I've just got to be me, me, me.

Whispering in his ear, my magic potion for love,
telling him I'm sicere, and that there's nothing too good for us.

But I want to be free, free, free,
and I've just got to be me, me, me.

Teasing hands on his mind, give our nights such mistery,
happiness all the time, oh and how that man pleases me.

But I want to be free, free, free,
and I've just got to be me, me, me.

And I've just got to be me.

Feeling you close to me, makes all my senses smile (smile),
let's not waste ecstasy, 'cause I'll be only here for a while.

I've gotta be free, free, free, ooh,
and I've just got to be me, me, me.
free, free, free to be me,
(and I've just gotta be me) and I just wanna, I just wanna be me.

I've just got to sail on (free), honey,
good times never felt so good,
I've just got to sail on (free), sugar,
good times never felt so good,
I've just got to sail on (sail on), baby (sail on baby),
freedom never felt so good, no it never felt so good,
I've just got to sail on, honey,
(being free) being free never felt so good,
I've just got to sail on (sail on), honey (sail on honey),
good times (good times), never felt so good (no they never felt so good),
I've just got to sail on (sail on), sugar (sail on sugar),
good times never felt so good (never felt so good),
I've just got to sail on (never felt so good), baby (never felt so good),
freedom never felt so good.
