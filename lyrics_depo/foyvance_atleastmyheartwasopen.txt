Well, I tried to do what I felt was right
And I know I fucked it up sometimes
But at least my heart was open

You're the one to cross the line
But you could not go the extra mile
So I did what you were hoping
And at least my heart was open

At least my blood still pumping
I know that it wants sometime burning
I have known your love and I have known your hate
I watched devastate to the grave

Oh, but every moment's golden
Though our withered arms entwined was not your faith
Why we can't be lovers, friends or even mates
Well, your chances come right for you

Because every moment's golden
I did what you were hoping
And at least my heart was open
At least my blood still pumping

I know that it wants sometime
If you get out of this nightmare
Then think to call me to tell me how somebody broke your heart
Don't try, I won't be there

Cause when we ended I found somebody knew that I can start with
She's younger
Her and I, we never really wanna be apart
You're my craft and so am I

Oh, I was far from you
But I tried to do what I felt was right
And I know I fucked it up sometimes
But at least my heart was open
