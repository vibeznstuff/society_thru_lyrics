Goodbye my love, goodbye my love
Though I love you truly
It was meant to be
That I'd lose your love
Goodbye my love, goodbye

So long my love, be strong my love
You've done nothing wrong
This love can't go on
So take care my love
Goodbye my love, goodbye

And I know that you're not happy at all
Any fool can plainly see
And I know I'm the one you really love
But I can't go on sharing you, sharing you

Goodbye my love, don't cry my love
I love you sincerely, it just had to be
It hurts me so inside to say, "Goodbye
Goodbye my love"
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
