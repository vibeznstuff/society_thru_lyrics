You came in from the darkness and held the door open wide
You stood there like a vision before my unbelieving eyes
I believe in what I see and also what I hear
But did the night play tricks on me or were you really there?

Am I being hypnotized?
Feelin' like I'm hypnotized
Am I being hypnotized?
Feelin' like I'm hypnotized

Am I being?
Am I being?
Am I being?

Fear has gripped my heart and I am whisperin' out your name
Can you hear the silence screamin' do they sound the same?

Am I being hypnotized?
Feelin' like I'm hypnotized
Am I being hypnotized?
Feelin' like I'm hypnotized

Am I being hypnotized?
Feelin' like I'm hypnotized
Am I being hypnotized?
Feelin' like I'm hypnotized

You came in from the darkness and held the door open wide
You stood there like a vision before my unbelieving eyes
I believe in what I see and also what I hear
But did the night play tricks on me or were you really there?

Am I being hypnotized?
Feelin' like I'm hypnotized
Am I being hypnotized?
Feelin' like I'm hypnotized

Am I being hypnotized?
Feelin' like I'm hypnotized
Am I being hypnotized?
Feelin' like I'm hypnotized
