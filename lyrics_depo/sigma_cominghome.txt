Know I'll never find it on my own
'Cause this life ain't leading nowhere I can go
I'm standing still with nothing in my way
Letting me go so I can find myself again

I need that
Ground beneath my feet to feel that
Ground beneath my feet
I need that
Ground beneath my feet to feel that
Ground beneath my feet
I need that

I need that home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
'Cause this life that I've been living ain't my own
Home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
'Cause I'm tired of being out here on my own
I'm coming home, oh yeah yeah yeah
I'm coming home, oh yeah
And all of this time I've been living it up
And all I've got left is rubble and dust
Oh oh, I'm coming home

I know if I can find my own way back
There's a life I always knew but never had
I'm tired of fighting things that I can't change
Letting me go so I can finally find my place

I need that
Ground beneath my feet to feel that
Ground beneath my feet
I need that
Ground beneath my feet to feel that
Ground beneath my feet
I need that
Ground beneath my feet to feel that
Ground beneath my feet
I need that
Ground beneath my feet to feel that
Ground beneath my feet
I need that

I need that home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
'Cause this life that I've been living ain't my own
Home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
'Cause I'm tired of being out here on my own
I'm coming home, oh yeah yeah yeah
I'm coming home, oh yeah
And all of this time I've been living it up
And all I've got left is rubble and dust
Oh oh, I'm coming home
