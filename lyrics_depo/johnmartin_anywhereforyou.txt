We can rewrite the story
Tonight we're forever young
Yeah, tonight we're forever young

Through the pain and the heartaches
There's still love for everyone
There's still love for everyone

Hey, would you believe me if I said
We are here for a reason
Now this is our life
This is what counts
This is for us
I would go anywhere for you
I would go anywhere for you, yeah
I would go anywhere for you, yeah

Heaven knows you're a dreamer
Don't hide it from anyone
Don't hide it from anyone

Never doubt what you're made of
There's a hero in everyone
There's a hero in everyone

Hey, would you believe me if I said
We are here for a reason
Now this is our life
This is what counts
This is for us
I would go anywhere for you
I would go anywhere for you, yeah
I would go anywhere for you, yeah
I would go anywhere for you, yeah

Hold on tonight, for us,
I would go anywhere for you, yeah
I would go anywhere for you, yeah
