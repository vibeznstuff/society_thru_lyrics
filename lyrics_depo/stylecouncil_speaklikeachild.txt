Your hair hangs in golden steps
You're a bonafide in every respect
You are walking through streets that mean nothing to you
You believe you're above it and I don't really blame you
Maybe that's why you speak like a child;
The things you're saying like "I'm so free and so wild"
And I believe it when you look in my eyes;
You offer me a life, and never lies
Least only the kind to make me smile

Your clothes are clean and your mind is productive
It shops in store where only the best buy
You're cool and hard, and if I sound like a lecher
It's probably true,
But at least there's no lecture

I really like it when you speak like a child
The crazy sayings like "I'm so free and so wild"
You have to make a bargain with me now
A promise that you won't change somehow
No way, now how

Spent all day thinking about you
Spent all night coming to terms with it
Time and conditions are built to tame
Nothing lasts with age, so people say
But I will always try to feel the same

I really like it when you speak like a child
I really like it when you speak like a child
The way you hate the homely rank and the file
The way you're so proud to be oh, so free and so wild

I really like it when you speak like a child
I really like it when you speak like a child
I really like it when you speak like a child
The way you're so proud to be oh, so free and so wild
