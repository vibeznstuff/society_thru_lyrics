Do you wanna feel good, Do you wanna feel anything
Do you wanna keep searching cos there's no other reason
Do you wanna feel small, Do you wanna fight back
Do you wanna new soul to stop your heart attack
Do you wanna take a walk then come into the garden with me

They tell me Jimmie's seen a sign, says he understands everything
They tell me Jimmie's got a line to the man from the ministry
But Jimmies on sale, He's got a mouth to feed
He's got a mission in life, A thousand lives to lead
Do you wanna take his hand and come into the garden with me

Jimmie Jones and his soul clones will get you (Jimmies got a place for me)

There's a rumour going round that the garden's not the place to be
And little Jimmies in the dark between the devil and the deep blue sea

So we've all gotta change clothes and we've all gotta change sides
We gotta love you, leave you miles behind
But if you wanna talk a walk then come into the garden with me

Jimmie Jones and his soul clones will get you (Jimmies got a place for me)

Heaven is, heaven is
Jimmie says, heaven is
Heaven is logical, heaven is physical, wonderful, beautiful, saleable, cynical
Heaven is the space between your eyes where you disguise your little lives

Jimmie Jones and his soul clones will get you (Jimmies got a place for me)
