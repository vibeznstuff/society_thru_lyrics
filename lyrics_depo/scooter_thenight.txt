Rumble in the jungle!
Aah!

Back on the mic I got the sound
Holding you down, down to the ground
Speaking the melody
Who out there got the skills to test me?

I've been here for far too long
It's time to break out
It's time to be strong

Beats going crazy inside my head
Do you feel alright?
Here comes the night

All my friends are talking to me
What's this love I see?
I know you can make it right
I'm still waiting now
Waiting for the love I need
If you want me too
There's something don't understand
I don't know

Yeah!

All my friends are talking to me
What's this love I see?
I know you can make it right
I'm still waiting now
Waiting for the love I need
If you want me too
There's something don't understand
I don't know

Don't be afraid, it's just my work
Comin' up bringing the words
Soon I'll have ya movin' in time
It ain't my fault, just the lyrics that rhyme
As I chop, change, rearrange
Choose and refuse, cause of fame
Gonna getcha hot like a burning flame
Everything's alright
Here comes the night

All my friends are talking to me
What's this love I see?
I know you can make it right
I'm still waiting now
Waiting for the love I need
If you want me too
There's something don't understand
I don't know

Yeah!

All my friends are talking to me
What's this love I see?
I know you can make it right
I'm still waiting now
Waiting for the love I need
If you want me too
There's something don't understand
I don't know

Waiting for the love I need
If you want me too
There's something don't understand
I don't know
