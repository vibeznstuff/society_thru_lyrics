Well, me and my girl went out the other night
Down lover's lane we were walkin'
She said, "Aw honey child, do you love me?"
Right away I started talkin',
"Is a blue bird blue? Has a cat got a tail?
Mmmm, if a blue bird's blue, well then honey, I love you."

Well. I held her close and kissed her
Then I looked in those big green eyes
She said, "I hear boy that you love me!'
I said, "I wouldn't be at all surprised.
Is a blue bird blue? Can a big wheel roll?
Mmmm, if a blue bird's blue, then honey, I love you."

Well, she finally believed my story
Said, "Baby I understand.
Well, now I'm gonna be your little lovin' girl
And you'll be my big lovin' man.
Is a blue bird blue? Ahh, has a bear got hair?
Mmmm, if a blue bird's blue, well honey, I love you."

Ahhh, is a blue bird blue, baby?
Ah, tell me honey, has a bear got hair?
Oooh, can a big wheel roll?..
