Every move that I make
Every inch I've grown
In my heart, in my soul, you're in my bones
Wanna feel, wanna feel everything you do
'Cause at the end of the day, all I need is you

So I keep holding on
When the world is falling
Holding on
When the light is calling
Holding on
When forever rolls on through
I'll be holding on to you

Turn around take it back to yesterday
Now I know everything that I need to say
You're the words on my lips and the melody
You're the key to the door that will set me free

So I keep holding on
When the world is falling
Holding on
When the light is calling
Holding on
When forever rolls on through
I'll be holding on to you

So I keep holding on
When the world is falling
Holding on
When the light is calling
Holding on
When forever rolls on through
I'll be holding on to you
