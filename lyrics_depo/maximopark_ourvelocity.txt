I'm not a man
I'm a machine
Chisel me down until I am clean
I buy books I never read
And then I tell you some more about me!

Beneath the concrete there's a sound
A muffled cry below the ground
There is a poison in the air
A mix of chemicals and fear
My words are just hunches
I'm not sure what they mean
You're asking for commitment when I'm somewhere in between

Never, never try to gauge temperature when you tend to travel at such speed
It's our velocity
Is it cold where you are this time of year?
You didn't leave a scar

A stream of numbers hit a screen and you're expected to know what they mean
Throughout the conflict I was serene
I can't outrun the sadness I've seen
Are you willing to resist for people you've never met?
The devil's wheel revolves but it needs to be reset

Never, never try to gauge temperature when you tend to travel at such speed
It's our velocity
Please tell me, is it cold where you are this time of year?
You didn't leave a scar

I've got no-one to call in the middle of the night anymore
I'm just alone with these thoughts
I've got no-one to call in the middle of the night anymore
I'm just alone with my thoughts

I watched a film to change my feelings
I'm strong enough to bear a burden
If everyone became this sensitive, I wouldn't have to be so sensitive
If everyone became so sensitive, perhaps I wouldn't be so sensitive

Love is a lie
Which means I've been lied to
Love is a lie
Which means I've been lying too
Love is a lie
Which means I've been lied to
Love is a lie

I've got no-one to call in the middle of the night anymore
I'm just alone with these thoughts
I've got no-one to call in the middle of the night anymore
I'm just alone with my thoughts

Never, never try to gauge temperature when you tend to travel at such speed
It's our velocity
