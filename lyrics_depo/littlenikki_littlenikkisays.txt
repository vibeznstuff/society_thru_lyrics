Anything you can do, I can do it better
If you don't like that, better put it in a letter
If you're playing on my grounds, my rules my house

Love is up, and the hate is down
If you don't want me, get out my zone
Hop a little, boobers fly, so why can't I

Oh oh oh oh oh
You are invited to join me at awesome
Oh oh oh oh oh
Do what I'll say and do what I do

Little Nikki says put your hands up up up up high
Little Nikki says take your hips down down down down low
Little Nikki says let your heart swing swing side to side
Swing swing and slide
Stop, Nikki didn't say
Stop, Nikki didn't say
Stop, Nikki didn't say

Skip skip, skip to my loop
Bring me a cake and I'll eat ya too
Life's too short to waste this slice
Uhm uhm, taste nice

I'm sick, I'm bad, I'm cray and I
Was born so cool that I scared my dad
I say it but oh, then you'd say it too
Dip dip doo, I'm stepping on you

Oh oh oh oh oh
You are invited to join me at awesome
Oh oh oh oh oh
Do what I'll say and do what I do

Little Nikki says put your hands up up up up high
Little Nikki says take your hips down down down down low
Little Nikki says let your heart swing swing side to side
Swing swing and slide
Stop, Nikki didn't say
Stop, Nikki didn't say
Stop, Nikki didn't say

Little Nikki says put your hands up up up up high
Little Nikki says take your hips down down down down low
Stop, Nikki didn't say
Stop, Nikki didn't say
Stop, Nikki didn't say
