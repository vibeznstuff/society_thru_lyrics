The sewers belch me up 
The heavens spit me out 
From ethers tragic I am born again 
And now I'm with you now 
Inside your world of wow 
To move in desires made of deadly pretends 
Till the end times begin

Is it bright where you are 
Have the people changed 
Does it make you happy you're so strange 
And in your darkest hour, I hold secrets flame 
You can watch the world devoured in it's pain 
Strange

Climb my ribcage to 
The replays run for you 
Unhook my lights to peek behind the flash 
For I am crystal chrome 
I am shatter dome 
I am kremlin king of angels avenged 
To destroy the end

Is it bright where you are 
Have the people changed 
Does it make you happy you're so strange 
And in your darkest hour, I hold secrets flame 
You can watch the world devoured in it's pain

The zeppelins rain upon us 
The guns of love disastrous 
A shadow lies amongst you 
To defy the future cast

Is it bright where you are 
Have the people changed 
Does it make you happy you're so strange 
And in your darkest hour, I hold secrets flame 
You can watch the world devoured in it's pain 
Strange 
Strange
