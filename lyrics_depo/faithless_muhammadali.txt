"If all you keep hearing it so long you will see me as a super star and you'll have time to waste with your minions and things"

I see your face in front of me, still grainy
From that old black'n'white TV
My whole family silent,
Watchin' you shape destiny witcha two hands
Faster than the eye could see...

Mesmerising

Y'Know what? Skinny lickle me, started to strut.
Ten years old, suddenly bold,
'Cos I resolved to live like my hero in the ring...
Be smart, never give an inch, no retreating
An I racked up, respect from teachers, rednecks
And creatures who attack in a pack like insects.
Never, seen the like, not before or since,
A young prince an I remain convinced of his invincibility,
Athletic agility, virility, still a free spirit.
Forever through eternity, stingin' like a bee...
Muhammad Ali.

I want you to know
Your are the o-riginal
I want you to know
Your are the o-riginal
I want you to know
Your are the o-riginal

Your achievements defy belief, 
From the belly of the beast
Risin' like yeast yo, my relief from low self-esteem
Came when I saw you rappin' on my TV screen, float.
Like a butterfly that describe my walk to school.
After fight night, I felt so cool
Cos' I was the greatest too.
Love of self born simply out of love for you
An I knew someday people'll love me too
None of the hecklin about my black skin got through.
I woulda walked barefoot through hell for you
It's how I felt back then an I still do so will you
Accept these humble words of praise.
And my gratitude for those glorious days
And meritorious ways instilled in a young mind
Skills sublime,
Yours to mine.

I want you to know
Your are the o-riginal
I want you to know
Your are the o-riginal
I want you to know
Your are the o-riginal
