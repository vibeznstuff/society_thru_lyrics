This is love
This is pain disguised as a dream
Memories
Are guaranteed to break your heart.

Look at me
I woke up and found me alone
I wonder
If you'll ever think of me.

I won't cry
Now you're gone
I won't cry.
I should take
Your picture
From the wall.
This is love
What's it for?
It takes everything.
