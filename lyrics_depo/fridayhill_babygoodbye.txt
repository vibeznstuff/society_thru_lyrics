Look in your eyes I see a new story,
I can’t deny my past ent perfect too,
Singin, I’m not here to get false answers
But just like you I got true questions too (yeah)

I never wanna let you go,
In ya eyes I can tell that is what we both know,
I neva wanna see you cry,
Or love so burn baby let it die,

(Baby, Baby, Baby)


I wanted you to go your way,
I wanted me to go mine,
I, sittin here thinking,
Passing the time,
I wanted you to go your way,
I wanted me to go mine,
I never thought you’d say,
Baby goodbye

Hearin your voice just makes me remember,
All those times when we were nothing more than friends,
I knew you, you knew me, and everything was plain to see,
How did I let us get so deep?

I never wanna let you go,
In ya eyes I can tell that is what we both know,
I neva wanna see you cry,
Or love so burn baby let it die,

(Baby, Baby, Baby)


I wanted you to go your way,
I wanted me to go mine,
I, sittin here thinking,
Passing the time,
I wanted you to go your way,
I wanted me to go mine,
I never thought you’d say,
Baby goodbye


Sure, I looked in ya eyes then I said,
Baby I loved all the time that we spent,
Then you replied with a tear in ya eye,
It should come to an end then we’ll both be friends,
Both shed tears then we sat for a while,
That stone cold feeling then putting on a smile,
Know that your leavin looking to the sky,
That one dark evening killin me inside,
Through a new doorway to a next life,
Cuz you’ve gone you way and I’ll go mine,
Yo, I still see ya face though we’ve both been apart,
I know you’ve got your place deep in my heart,
Sure, I just feel so down,
Mite come around but its for the best now,
Both broke down and I’m choked inside,
And from the first time when I said baby goodbye,

Baby I tried to understand,
Why ya had to leave me,
And why ya had to be free,
Lady I hope you understand,

(I didn’t disagree, and why we weren’t meant to be)


I wanted you to go your way,
I wanted me to go mine,
I, sittin here thinking,
Passing the time,
I wanted you to go your way,
I wanted me to go mine,
I never thought you’d say,
Baby goodbye
