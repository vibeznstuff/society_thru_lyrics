It's 4 in the morning
and she’ll be gone by 5
she's got me tangled in sheets
And all tangled up inside
I can feel her heart racing
Like a bird that needs to fly
Oh I've never been this close to something that wild

She's like a storm of wild horses
As they thunder across the plains
she's like the mighty Mississippi
When she's come out of the rains
she's a raging tornado in an Oklahoma sky
Oh I've never been this close to something that wild

She's like trying to catch a rain
Or hold sand in your hand
she's the kind that sometimes wants one
But she sure don't need a man
Oh her heart might want to stay
But I know that's not her style
Oh I've never been this close to something that wild

She's like a storm of wild horses
As they thunder across the plains
she's like the mighty Mississippi
When she's come out of the rains
she's a raging tornado in an Oklahoma sky
Oh I've never been this close to something that wild

And when she lays her love down on me
Even though she's just a stranger
Lord I know it might sound crazy
But I've grown to the danger
That surrounds her, burning inside her

She's like a storm of wild horses
As they thunder across the plains
she's like the mighty Mississippi
When she's come out of the rains
she's a raging tornado in an angry Kansas sky
Oh I've never been this close to something that wild
Oh I've never been this close to something that wild
