I'm ready for the start of something new
I'm ready to depart from what made me blue
I'm ready for my heart to let you through
But most of all, most of all
I'm ready for the rain to pour down on me
I'm ready for a change to come and set me free
I'm ready for my loss to become victory
But most of all, most of all


I'm ready for your love, I'm ready for your love
I'm ready for your love
I'm ready for your love, I'm ready for your love
I'm ready for your love


I'm ready for my hands to touch the sky
I wanna understand how it feels to fly
I'm ready for my eyes to see the light
But most of all, most of all
I'm ready to be strong, conquer my fears
I'm ready to be wrong, so I can be right there
I'm ready to belong and shake my cares
But most of all, yeah, most of all




The stars burn bright
Everything has changed between you and I
I was so apprehensive but I don't know why
Baby, I'm ready for you to be by my side
