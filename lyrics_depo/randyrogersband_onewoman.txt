I don't need empty love words coming from somebody  
That'll never love me like you do
I don't need to feel a warm touch from somebody else cause 
No other touch could be this true 
They can't reach me cause I'm tied to

One woman, you, for me 
I know that you're all I'll ever need 
Forever beside you, spending my life loving 
One woman

Well everything about you inside and out is perfect 
Over the edge I always fall 
Every time I see you the way I feel reminds me 
The world I knew seems so small 
Cause now with you I have it all

One woman, you, for me 
I know that you're all I'll ever need 
Forever beside you, spending my life loving 
One woman

Well back when I was selfish 
I thought I needed more 
But that road led me nowhere 
And I closed that door 
And now I love for 

One woman, you, for me 
I know that you're all I'll ever need 
Forever beside you, spending my life loving 
One woman, you for me
I know that you're all I need 
Forever beside you, spending my life loving
