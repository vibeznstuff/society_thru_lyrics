You show your age,
when you drown your rage.
But I see past those laughter lines,
so baby, lets split tonight,
I got a tank full of gas till light.

Yeah we can drive for miles and miles
But you just said,
"Not for all the love in the world"
"Not for all the love in the world"

Cause she didn't realize, now thats a lotta love

Pipe dreams fade,
and all the underdogs get laid.
Left your heart in the hands of a jugglin clown.
And so you crave recognition,
but the keys to the city went missing

People are all puzzles to be figured out
But you just said,
"Not for all the love in the world"
"Not for all the love in the world"

Cause she didnt realize, now thats alotta love
Oh Oh

I guess that everybody,
went to a better party, oh no
Not for all the love in the world
Not for all the love in the world
But she didnt realize, now thats a lotta love.
