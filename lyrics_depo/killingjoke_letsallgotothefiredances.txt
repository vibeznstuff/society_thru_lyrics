On our way to the fire dances 
Let's all stay on our feet so 
In the market here we are then 
Sing a song for sixpence oh! 
Time keeps ticking - tick tick tock 
Can't stop now just keep on pushing 
I've got a feeling something's changing 
I'm gonna find this feeling somewhere 

Let's all go to the fire dances 

Take the future in your hands now 
Let's do this dance forever 
Teacher teach me something new please 
Sow the seed god speed the plough 
Basic ways to simplify me 
Sun is shining in your favour 
Push push me till I get there 
I'm gonna find the human somewhere 

Turn the pages time goes backwards 
Pay the piper to play your tune 
You and me in a dance forever 
Summer nights and music - oh! 
Fill your cup and don't say maybe 
Sun is shining in our favour 
Let's be human - oh so human 
On your way to the fire dances
