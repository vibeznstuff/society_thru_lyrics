You're like Voodoo baby, 
You just take hold. 
Put your cards on the table baby, 
Do I twist do I fold? 

You're like Voodoo Honey 
All silver and gold? 
Why don't you tell me my future? 
Why don't I sell you my soul. 



So here it comes - the sound of drums. 
Here comes the drums, here comes the drums ? 



Baby, baby, baby! 
You are my Voodoo Child - my Voodoo Child 

Don't say maybe, maybe 
It's Supernatural - I'm coming undone? 



You're like Voodoo baby, 
Your kisses are cold! 
Feel your poison running through me? 
Let me never grow old. 

You're like Voodoo honey, 
My pictures you stole? 
You play me like a puppet. 
Sticking pins in a doll!
