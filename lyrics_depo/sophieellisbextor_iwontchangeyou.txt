I used to change my accent, change my stance 
My phone number, the way I dance 
Some people change lovers like they change their sheets 
But I won't change you honey, you're for keeps 

I used to think I had to change the way I am 
To feel better, to get a man 
But once I stopped trying I fell for you 
You fell for me so I'll stay the same for you 

Oh yeah I know that I'm not perfect baby 
Oh yeah it's no reason to go crazy 
Oh yeah boy you can always count on me 
For better or for worse I will always put you first 

Now that I have found you 
You've changed my life 
Cos you're the one who showed me 
I have everything right 
We're never gonna differ cos we know it's true 
So don't change me and I won't change you 

I used to change my style like I changed my mind 
I tried to change a tyre but I'm not that way inclined 
Tried to change my figure my diet too 
I'll still change my underwear if that's O.K with you 
But after seeing you I know that here is best 

Oh yeah the world can sometimes make you feel bad 
Oh yeah but don't forget the things you have 
Oh yeah boy you can always count on me 
In sickness and in health baby always be yourself
