I really believe in love
I really believe in love that won't die
But no matter how hard I try
I just can't make you realize
I've been here all alone
When it comes to me and you, no spotlight on
'Cause you always think that you can do better, better, better

But will you call me when I'm famous?
When I'm famous
Would you call my name?
Will you call me when I'm famous?
When I'm famous
Will you call my name?
When I'm famous

What's a man gotta do to make you happy?
Is it all about the fortune and fame?
Would you care if they scream my name?
If they did I would still feel the same
I've been here all alone
When it comes to me and you, no spotlight on
Cause you always think that you can do better, better, better

But will you call me when I'm famous?
When I'm famous
Would you call my name?
Will you call me when I'm famous?
When I'm famous
Will you call my name?
When I'm famous...

If I told you honestly
Honestly, I don't believe
You would take the diamond rings
Things that only fade overnight
I would rather you and me
Living on another dream
Make it a reality, and hopefully

You won't only call me when I'm famous
(When I'm famous baby)
When I'm famous
Would you call my name?
(Would you call my name? Would you call, baby?)
Will you call me when I'm famous, baby?
Oh, when I'm famous
Will you call my name?
(Would you call my name?)

Will you call me?
Will you call me?
Will you call?
Call my name
Will you call me?
Will you call me?
Will you call?
Call my name

I really believe in love
I really believe in love that won't die
And it can only get better, better, better
When I'm famous
