I fell out of bed
This morning
Oh, something was buggin' me
I couldn't sleep ‘cause I hadn't had any lovin'

So I've got to solve this problem out, baby
And darling, I know what the remedy should be

At night when I turn out the lights
I want someone to wrap my body tight
A lover to keep my body warm
I need a woman to wrap my body tight

As the day goes by
Thought weighs heavy on my mind
Only thing I think about
Is tonight the lights go out

Ooh, and I hope it's you tonight
But not just tonight
Every day and every night I want your love
Hold me, sweet, sweet love

So I'm telling you my problems
Because I know you know exactly what I need, woo

At night when I turn out the lights
I want someone to wrap my body tight
A lover to keep my body warm
I need a woman to wrap my body tight

At night when I turn out the lights
I want someone to wrap my body tight
A lover to keep my body warm
I need a woman to wrap my body tight

Ooh
Come on, come on and squeeze me, girl
Warp, wrap my body
Warp, wrap my body
Real tight, yeah, yeah

Girl, I have to solve this problem out, baby
And I know what the remedy should be
I need someone to hold me
I need a woman right here, right here next to me

At night when I turn out the lights
I want someone to wrap my body tight
A lover to keep my body warm
I need a woman to wrap my body tight

At night when I turn out the lights
I want someone to wrap my body tight
A lover to keep my body warm
I need a woman to wrap my body tight

At night when I turn out the lights
I want someone to wrap my body tight
A lover to keep my body warm
I need a woman to wrap my body tight

Come on work me, hold me, love me
