Tina lives in Berlin
Her voice so seldom
On my machine
Is here tonight
And I'm on the market
And when I'm on the market
Words move faster
Wire
Clouds move
Thin between us
Like a skin
Like a salty skin
For a seed
A fat circles
A smiling smiling
Her voice so intentionally
Smiling
And a cloud between us
And these are my intentions
Pushing...

The blonde
Is carrying something
Is carrying me
And someone I used to be
Great plastic someone
Blue plastic girl
Your cream is
Pushing...
Pushed away your body is

Coffee for the unbelieve
Carry on song
Lipstick for the
The boyfriend blond
Between the holes of seeds
Is professionally poised
Faces watching her
She's watching the faces
Watching her
Pushin...
