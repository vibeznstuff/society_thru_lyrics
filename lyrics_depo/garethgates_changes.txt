I can't run, if you can't hide 
And I'm allowed to change my mind, 
But if I find a way to erase, 
Turn the page on what we've left behind, 
Cause I can't breath, when your round with my sight, 

I, I don't believe in shame, 
but it's alright to feel the pain, 
everybody feels some pain, 
and I know, I've seen it in your eyes, 
everytime I see you cry, i realise, 
I've seen your tears to many times, 
We're going through changes, 

I know I'm wrong I realise, 
It's not my place to try and justify, what is right, 
I'm not that knife in your side, 
cos I'm shedding that skin that I'm in, 
it's not my fate to live a life without you in, 

I, I don't believe in shame, 
but it's alright to feel the pain, 
everybody feels some pain, 
and I know, I've seen it in your eyes, 
everytime I see you cry, i realise, 
I've seen your tears to many times, 
We're going through changes,
