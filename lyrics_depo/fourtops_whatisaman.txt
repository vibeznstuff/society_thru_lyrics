A man can walk proudly down in the street
A man's not ashamed of what he believes
He knows how to laugh, he knows when to cry
He knows how to live, he's not afraid to die

What is a man? What is a man?
What is a man? What is a man?

A man searches for the key to success
He'd rather be sure than make a wild guess
He knows how to love, he knows how to hate
He knows when to move and he knows just when to wait

What is a man? What is a man?
What is a man? What is a man?

A man can be angry and still hold his tongue
A man don't give up till the battle is won
He knows how to win, he's not ashamed to lose
He knows his destiny, he doesn't take long to choose

What is a man? What is a man?
What is a man? What is a man?

What is a man? Just what is a man?
What is a man?
