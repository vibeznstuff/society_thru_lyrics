When you look at me
Tell me what you see
Do you see no love at all?
Or do you see in me
What you always see
In every girl that you fall for

I will show you how love is meant to be
Just watch and learn and listen to me


Will you ever see the day
Heartache leads astray
Good love will always come from me
Will you ever learn to love
Without a little doubt
Good love will always come from me

When you look away
Is it mean to say
That she haunts you night and day
And does it hurt your heart
When I say let's start
To heal the part that's been torn

Don't you see that
I'm really worth a try
And I say to you 
I know just what to do



Don't you see that I
I'm really worth a try
And I say to you
I know just what to do
