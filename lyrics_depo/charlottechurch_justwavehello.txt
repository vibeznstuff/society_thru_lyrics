Just leave all your troubles behind now
My way is clear and true
Reach into the light
That shines in you.

E giunta l'ora del desio
All around the world
Questo e il momento dell'addio
All around the world
The dawn is rising on a new day
Time for us to go
The shadows fall and quickly fade away
Time to wave hello

It's time to go now
Time to wave hello now
Let your dreams be wings
That fly as far as the stars

It's time to wave hello
All around the world we go
Shadows fall behind us
As we follow the Sun
That moment has come
It's time to wave hello

It's time to go now
Time to wave hello now
Raise your hands and show the world
And tell everyone the moment has come
It's time to wave hello.

Just wave hello, Just wave hello
Just wave hello

This is the hour of destiny

This is the moment of goodbye
