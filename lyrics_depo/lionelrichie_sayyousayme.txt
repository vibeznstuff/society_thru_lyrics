Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

I had a dream,
I had an awesome dream
People in the park
Playing games in the dark
And what they played
Was a masquerade
And from behind the walls of doubt
A voice was crying out



As we go down
Life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do
Is to find a friend or two
That helping hand
Someone who understands
That when you feel you lost your way
You've got someone there to say,
I'll show you



So you think you know the answers, oh no
Well the whole world's got you dancing
That's right, I'm telling you
It's time to start believing, oh yes
Believing who you are, you are a shining star



Say it together, naturally
