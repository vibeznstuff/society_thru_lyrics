Our lives are stories, waiting to be told
In search of silver linings, we discovered gold
And judgement taught us that our hearts were wrong
But they're the ones that we'll look down upon

The rules say our emotions don't comply
But we'll defy the rules until we die

So let's be sinners to be saints
And let's be winners by mistake
The world may disapprove
But my world is only you
And if we're sinners then it feels like heaven to me

You showed me feelings I've never felt before
We're making enemies, knocking on the devil's door
But how can you expect me not to eat,
When the forbidden fruit tastes so sweet?

So let's be sinners to be saints
And let's be winners by mistake
The world may disapprove
But my world is only you
And if we're sinners then it feels like heaven to me

Our hearts are too ruthless to break
Let's start fires for heavens sake
Our hearts are too ruthless to break
Let's start fires for heavens sake
Our hearts are too ruthless to break
Let's start fires for heavens sake
Our hearts are too ruthless to break

So let's be sinners to be saints
And let's be winners by mistake
The world may disapprove
But my world is only you

And if we're sinners then
It feels like heaven
To me

And if we're sinners then it feels like heaven to me
