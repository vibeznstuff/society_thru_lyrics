Somethin bout the way she’s wearing her dress a little tighter 
Somethin bout the way she’s starin, she’s lookin to start a fire 
Somethin bout the way she’s dancin and drinkin chill patron 
If she’s lonely now she won’t be lonely long 

Heaven help the fool who did her wrong 
It’s too late, too bad, she’s too far gone 
He should’ve thought of that before he left her all alone 
If she’s lonely now, she won’t be lonely long 

Somethin bout the way she’s blushin you can tell she isn’t sure 
Let you know she’s up to something she’s never done before 
Tonight she wants to hold a stranger but not the one at home 
If she’s lonely now she won’t be lonely long 

Heaven help the fool who did her wrong 
It’s too late, too bad, she’s too far gone 
He should’ve thought of that before he left her all alone 
If she’s lonely now, she won’t be lonely long 

If I had a woman like that 
Man I’d let her know 
I’d hold her tight 
I’d hold her close 
Do anything, do everything to let her know 
She’d never ever be alone 

Heaven help the fool who did her wrong 
It’s too late, too bad, she’s too far gone 
He should’ve thought of that before he left her all alone 
If she’s lonely now, lord if she’s lonely now 
If she’s lonely now, she won’t be lonely long
