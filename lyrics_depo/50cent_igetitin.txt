Yeah, Na na na na
Yeah, Na na na na


Now me I'm the life of the party
A little bit of juice, little bit of the gin
A little bit of mo' play, bottles of the rose
Feel a little buzz, then I'm getting it in
Now me I get it in, I get it in
Me I get it in, I get it in
Now me I get it in, I get it in
Me I get it in, I get it in


Look as soon as I step in the club
I swear my nigga, you can feel the attention shift
Started around twelve ended up around two
I better leave with more hoes than I came here with
I can't be responsible for what I say or I do
when I talk intoxicated
Shorty say I told her I love her
I put her out the next morning saying bitch I must have been faded
I don't know what you heard about me but the word about me
that I'm no trick, I'm no sucker, I'm no chump
I be in the VIP, with my niggaz round me
saying y'all can have whatever you want


Me I get it in
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we get it in
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink


I hate to say I told you so, but I told you so
I go hard when it's time to play
Shorty get to dropping it low, like the dancers do
in the Go-Go in front of me
She know I like to see her dance, she get to breaking it down
we get the bouncing outta control
Because I got a hell of a flow, we got paper to blow
my whole clique pop bottles galore
It's no secret the hood done peeped it
when we come through son, we look like bread
My '89 grind ,make my old nine shine
like we been moving bricks round this bitch for years
I say I get it in it's because I get it in
now shorty there a eight but her friend near a ten
I feeling a spend my G, she fuck with me I'm into win
I'm cooler than her ma then we do this shit again


Me I get it in
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we get it in
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink


Na na na na, Now me I'm the life of the party
A little bit of juice, little bit of the gin
A little bit of mo' play, bottles of the rose
Feel a little buzz, then I'm getting it in
Now me I get it in, I get it in
Me I get it in, I get it in
Now me I get it in, I get it in
Me I get it in, I get it in
