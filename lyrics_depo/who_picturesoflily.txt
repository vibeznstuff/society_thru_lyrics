I used to wake up in the morning
I used to feel so bad
I got so sick of having sleepless nights
I went and told my dad
He said "son now here's some little something"
And stuck them on my wall
And now my nights seem quite so lonely
In fact I, I don't feel bad at all
I don't feel bad at all

Made my life so wonderful
Pictures of Lily
Helped me sleep at night
Pictures of Lily
Solved my childhood problem
Pictures of Lily
Helped me feel alright

Pictures of Lily
Lily, Oh Lily
Lily, Oh Lily

And then one day things weren't quite so fine
I fell in love with Lily
I asked my dad where Lily I could find
He said "son now don't be silly
She's been dead since 1929"
Oh how I cried that night
If only I'd been born in Lily's time
It would have been alright

Pictures of Lily
Made my life so wonderful
Pictures of Lily
Helped me sleep at night
Pictures of Lily
But me and Lily are together in my dreams
And I ask ya, "Hey mister have ya ever seen?"
