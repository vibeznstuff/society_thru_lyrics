As I look around me I see the world
In a different light
Everything is changing and it happened
One night
Changing for the better and it starts
With you and me
So we'll sing our song together and forever
We'll be free

Sing a song of freedom
People together everybody sing
Sing a song of freedom each and everyman
People come together all across the land

If you're looking for an answer
It's very close hand
Just take a look around you and
Then you'll understand
Clap your hands together and let
Me hear the sound
It's the time for liberation so pass
The world around
