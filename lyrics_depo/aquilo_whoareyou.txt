Who are you
Forgive me, I'm hopeless with faces
But you sing with a voice like I know you
And suddenly I start to see
So perfect and convex

Who are you
'Cause just with a smile I'm around you
And I'll try my best like I know you
Who are you, who are you to me

Who are you
Stood next to my friends, I should know you
But given my look
I run without thinking
And fall without blinking, and I
And I'm forced to bare witness
Like a fool that's just waiting in line

Who are you
'Cause I can't quite think like I used to
And given my look
I run without thinking
And fall without blinking

Who are you
'Cause just with a smile I'm around you
And I'll try my best like I know you
Who are you, who are you to me
