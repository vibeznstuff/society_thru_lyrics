I was done at 16
Showin up for class
I was out there
In the ring
Learnin how to kick some ass
I was done at 16
Using my momma's key
It was all on me
Yes it was all on me

Weren't no free rides
Weren't no IOU's
I pulled my weight
I paid my dues
And I showed up
To enlist
On the first day of recruits
How bout you?
How bout you

I'm my brother's keeper
Every chance I can
I pay my taxes
Like any working man
And I feel I've earned
My right to choose
You don't get to play God, man
I do
You don't get to play God, man
I do

You get to run the world
In your special way
You get much more
Much more than your say
Government, religion
It's all just patriarchy
I must insist
You leave this one thing to me

Just one thing that a man needs
To be truly free
This is the modern world
And that one thing is money
But there are two things
That a woman needs
Control over her own body

Yes I pay the price
On top of everything
Each month a bill
Each month a reckoning
And each seed that dies
I cry and I bleed
So you can't tell me
No you can't tell me

I am a soldier
It's my blood that flows
I'd give my life
So that this tree can grow
You don't know creation
Like I know
So you can't tell me
No you can't tell me

I'm my brother's keeper
Every chance I can
I pay my taxes
Like any workin man
And I feel I've earned
My right to choose
You don't get to play God
I do
You don't get to play God
I do
You don't get to play God
I do
