What to do
Now that she doesn't want me
That's what haunts me
What to do

What to do
To keep from being lonely
Want her only
What to do

The record hops
And all the happy times we had
The soda shop
The walks to school now makes me sad

Oh, what to do
I know my heart ache's showin'
Still not knowin'
What to do
