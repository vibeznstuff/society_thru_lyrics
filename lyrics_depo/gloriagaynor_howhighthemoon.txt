Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Oh, somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
It's where you are
Oh, somewhere there's heaven
How near, how far
The brightest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will
Ooh, how still
My aching heart
How high the moon

(Somewhere there's music)
(It's where you are)
(Somewhere there's heaven)
(How near, how far)
The brightest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will
Ooh, how still
My aching heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music, music in the air
Oh, and I love this heaven, heaven when you're near
Oh, when you're near
I wanna hear the music
I know it's where you are
Please let me hear it
