As a child you would wait
And watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one that work while they all play

In youth you'd lay awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change, but it was just a dream!

Here we are.
Don't turn away now (don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town.
Here we are.
Don't turn away now (don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town from dust.

The time will come when you'll have to rise
Above the best, improve yourself
Your spirit never dies

Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above,
Don't weep for me
Cause this will be the labor of my love (my love)

Here we are.
Don't turn away now (don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are.
Don't turn away now (don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town from dust.

Here we are, don't turn away now (don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now (don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town from dust
