Midnight, one more night without sleepin'
Watchin', till the morning comes creepin'
Green door, what's that secret you're keepin'?

There's an old piano and they play it hot behind the green door
Don't know what they're doin' but they laugh a lot behind the green door
Wish they'd let me in so I could find out what's behind the green door

Knocked once, tried to tell 'em I'd been there
Door slammed, hospitality's thin there
Wonder just what's goin' on in there

Saw an eyeball peepin' through a smokey cloud behind the green door
When I said Joe sent me someone laughed out loud behind the green door
All I want to do is join the happy crowd behind the green door

Midnight, one more night without sleepin'
Watchin', till the morning comes creepin'
Green door, what's that secret you're keepin'?

Saw an eyeball peepin' through a smokey cloud behind the green door
When I said Joe sent me someone laughed out loud behind the green door
AII I want to do is join the happy crowd behind the green door
Wish they'd let me in so I could find out what's behind the green door.
