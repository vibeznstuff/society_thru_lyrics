Ooh, have you ever?
Have you ever loved, loved, loved, loved, loved?

You keep running, running away
I know you can't run forever
You think you're heading for a heartbreak again
Just as you did before

I can teach you how to love again
If you just trust in me
I can show you things you never seen
You don't know how much I'm missing

Have you ever loved somebody?
Can you learn to love somebody
The way somebody loves you?
Have you ever known that feeling
Ooh, that special feeling
When somebody loves you?

You build a fortress around yourself
Your emotions they hide within
You've got your heart securely locked away
And you won't let nobody in

Oh, I can show you how to love again
If you just trust in me
I can show you things you never seen
You don't know how much I'm missing

Have you ever loved somebody?
Can you learn to love somebody
If somebody loves you?
Have you ever known that feeling
Ooh, that special feeling
When somebody loves you?

Oh, when you think that it's safe, girl
Just take a look around
I will be there behind you
There's nothing to fear, no
'Coz I can never hurt you
I think the world about you
Can you learn to love me too
Can you learn to love me too

Mmm, I can teach you how to love again
If you just trust in me
I can show you things you never seen
You don't know how much I'm missing

Have you ever loved somebody?
Can you learn to love somebody
If somebody loves you?
Have you ever known that feeling
Ooh, that special feeling
When somebody loves you?

Have you ever loved somebody?
Can you learn to love somebody
If somebody loves you?
Have you ever known that feeling
Ooh, that special feeling
When somebody loves you?

Girl, I wanna teach you, yeah, oh, yeah
Let me show you, show you how to light the world
Oh, yes I do
I wanna teach you to love you all through the life
