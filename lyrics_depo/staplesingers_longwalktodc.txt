It's a long walk to DC but I've got my walking shoes on
I can't take a plane, passer train, because my money ain't that long
America we believe, oh that you love us still
So people I'm gonna be under to wipe away my tears

I'll tell ya, it's a long walk to DC but I'm on, ooh, yes, I am
Ooh yeah, but I know I'll make it some day
I know it's a whole lot of rocks and rifts before I make it there
Should've been going on yesterday, but today I am a leaving here

I've got a dime for some coffee, I got a dime to buy me a cake
I gotta see the president no matter what it takes
I'll tell yah, It's a long walk to DC, yeah
But I'm lonely, oh yes I am ooh, yeah, but I know I'll make it some day

I know that its a whole lots of rocks and rifts before I make it there
I should have been going on yesterday but today I am a leaving here
I've got a dime for some coffee, 'nother dime to buy me a cake
I gotta see the president, no matter what it takes

I'll tell ya, it's a long walk to DC but I'm on, ooh, yes, I am
Ooh yeah, but I know I'll make it some day
I'm gonna step out of Jackson, our Mississippi town
Through Alabama, haw, you know I'm Memphis bound
North Carolina, Virginia too

I gotta set my feet now on the national ground, yeah
