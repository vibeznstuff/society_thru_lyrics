Well he was fueled by a lack, drew inspiration from a need.
So many problems to crack and mouths to feed.
Crooked was the path, and brazen was the walk.
A cocky swagger, up the ladder, and could he ever talk.

The last hurrah? Nah! I'd do it again.
The Rascal King behind the bars 
or the one in front of them.

The love of God and constant contradictions,
With a smile, wink, or nod.
What's stranger, fact or fiction?
And never ceasing to amaze me on a regular basis.
First hand in his pocket or first fist into the faces.

The last hurrah? Nah! I'd do it again.
The Rascal King behind the bars 
or the one in front of them.

A legendary character.
When? Only then.
Where? Only there.
A hero or a hooligan? Well, that part's just never clear.
Pride or shame, it's all the same.
Who's innocent or who's to blame?
Politics or just a game?
Well in the end they knew his name.

The last hurrah? Nah! I'd do it again.
The Rascal King behind the bars 
or the one in front of them?
