Oh yeah baby
You got to make your mind up
Yeah, Kut Klose, help me out

-You know you are my lover
You got me twisted over you
I know i got what you need
So what you wanna do

Baby, baby I know
Baby I love you so
But you don't feel like I do
Tell me what can I do

-But I gotta be strong
Did me wrong
When I thought we were really down
So you say you want me
Make up your mind 
Cuz I'm not gonna be here for long


Baby, baby in time
Baby I know you'll find
That what you needed was here
Think about it my dear





Breaking up now 
You got me twisted
Thinking about the way things used to be
When it was you and me girl I was free
See you had my heart from the start
Like Cupid and I was just down right foolish and stupid
But now I know the reason for the pain and the headaches
You left me all alone now I can't even concentrate
I guess I'll wait for the day until you come back
Because my heart is where your love is at
You got me twisted
