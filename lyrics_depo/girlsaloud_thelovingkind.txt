Sometimes,
I watch you when you're sleeping
I wonder what you're feeling
Both wide awake and dreaming
Of yesterday, I want you
To kiss away the tensions
The issues never mentioned
With all the best intentions
But you turn away

Oh baby if you find
I'm not the loving kind
I'll buy you flowers
I'll pour you wine
Do anything to change your mind
I know you may be disinclined
To find the love we've left behind
So kiss me then make up your mind
I'm not the loving kind

I'd do anything
Sing songs that lover's sing
If I could change your mind
Am I not the loving kind?

I'd do anything
Sing songs that lover's sing
If I could change your mind
Am I not the loving kind?

Somewhere on a Monday morning
In a rush hour of another day
Standing on a crowded platform
Carelessly we lost our way

Sometimes
I watch you when you're sleeping
I wonder what you're feeling
Both wide awake and dreaming
Of yesterday

Oh baby if you find
I'm not the loving kind
I'll buy you flowers
I'll pour you wine
Do anything to change your mind
I know you may be disinclined
To find the love we've left behind
So kiss me then make up your mind
I'm not the loving kind
I'm not the loving kind
I'm not the loving kind

Oh baby if you find
I'm not the loving kind
I'll buy you flowers
I'll pour you wine
Do anything to change your mind
I know you may be disinclined
To find the love we've left behind
So kiss me then make up your mind
I'm not the loving kind
I'm not the loving kind
I'm not the loving kind
