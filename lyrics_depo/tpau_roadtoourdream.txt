This is a long road we travel
Is it as bad as it seems
Does it captivate your every thought
Oh, reaching for your dream
Well nobody comes to your door

Nobody gives it away
When you think you've found it
It slips through your fingers
Like sand it drifts away

So the moral goes
This is the way the story reads
Keep trying we believe

If this is the road we take to our dream
Do we walk in vain
If this is the road we take to our dream
And fall on the way
Get up and do it again

This is a long road we are traveling
Is it as bad as it seems
Does it captivate your every thought
Oh reaching for your dream
Well nobody comes to your door
There ain't no one gonna give it away
When you think you've found it
It slips through your fingers
Like sand it drifts away

So the moral goes
This is the way the story reads
Keep trying we believe

This is the road we take to our dream
Do we walk in vain
If this is the road we take to our dream
And fall on the way
Get up and do it again

This is a long road we're traveling
Is it as bad as it seems
Such a long road we're traveling
Is it as bad as it seems
We believe

If this is the road we take to our dream
Do we walk in vain
If this is the road we take to our dream
And fall on the way (fall on the way)
Get up and do it again
