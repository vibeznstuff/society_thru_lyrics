There's a kind of hush
all over the world tonight
All over the world
you can hear the sounds of lovers in love
You know what I mean

Just the two of us
and nobody else in sight
There's nobody else and I'm feeling good
Just holding you tight

So listen very carefully
Closer now and you will see what I mean
It isn't a dream

The only sound that you will hear
Is when I whisper in your ear I love you
For ever and ever
