It's only pain, it only hurts
I'm only down on the floor where I've been before
And I'll be here again though it hurts to lose you
It's only pain

We went so far, we flew so high
Now it's not easy to watch it die
Just let go, not ask the reason why
But it don't matter anymore

It's only pain, it only hurts
I'm only down on the floor where I've been before
And I'll be here again though it hurts to lose you
It's only pain

It's not my style, it's not my way
To see the future in shades of gray
Though I still can't bring myself to say
That you don't matter anymore

It's only pain, it only hurts
I'm only down on the floor where I've been before
And I'll be here again though it hurts to lose you
It's only pain
