If you got the money,
I think it would be funny
To take your girl, and spend a bit of your cash for me
(I've been watching you)
'Cause then she might be happy, and no longer lonely
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free

An' all the boys they go:
da-dee-doo-da-da-dee-da-doo-dah...
da-dee-doo-da-da-dee-da-doo-dah...

I spend late nights trying to pick up love
Off the floor, where the other brothers leave it be
Though it's stuck down hard it's like chewing gum
While a girl on the floor singing R.I.P.

'Cause the songbirds don't do singing on pavements
No sweet melody the sound of spit
We Spat, Orbit, spoke of lost hopes
So toot what took man choke on it

We be near heaven at a quarter to eleven
By three we are thinking of the love we lost
By four we be high, thinking of the girl lost second
Check the odds, was it worth the cost?

Do you give a toss?
Or are you, looking away?
Wondering why you can't eat?
Why you never sleep?
Drunk all the time?
Cold in the heat?
What you sow man is what you reap

If you've got the money, I think it would be funny
To take your girl and spend a bit of your cash for me
(I've been watching you)
'Cause then she might be happy, no longer lonely
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free
(I've been watching you)

You were always meant to walk out that job
You keep stopping, should tell your girl more often
That loving is all about doors unlocking
Now you're certain enough near a man free

With a Buddy Holly hiccup on a karaoke
Tweedle on the needle, man you're just for thread
My great granddaddy fought in Gallipoli
He's the only of his friends not shot down dead

Lovers all talk in the spits and tongues
Fight in the playgound, bully each other
Double dare kids up pollute their lungs
Threaten with the rep of their big boy brother

Some of the other stay, give it up and run away
Momma still wants you home for supper
Work all day, little to no pay
Dance up-town right down to the gutter

With the dee-dom dom-dee
Da-da-dee-dom-dom-dee

Move outta' the way man, dom-dee
Da-da-dee-dom-dom-dee
(I've been watching you)

Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money

If you've got the money
I think it would be funny
To take your girl and spend a bit of your cash for me
(I've been watching you)
'Cause then she might be happy, no longer lonely
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free

Said, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-money, oh
Said, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-money, oh
Said, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-money, oh
Said, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-money, oh

(I've been watching you)

If you've got the money
I think it should be funny, uh-oh
To take your girl and spend a bit of your cash for me
'Cause then she might be happy, no longer lonely, uh-oh
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free
