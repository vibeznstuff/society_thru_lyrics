Na Na Naii
Oh Na Na Noww



Said boy I've been seeing you for quite a while And I
Gotta confess express what you do to me
I need to tell you
About the way you've changed my life
So many beautiful nights you're the reason
Youve got me staying (Oh oh) through the night
See the thing is..


I don't quite understand
What you're trying to say (straight up)
Can you make it clearer?
I just want you nearer
See everyone around me keeps on saying that
I must be blind (well they do have a point)
Shut up!

All I'm tryin to say is that
Wouldn't you wouldn't you
Like to have me to yourself
All to myself
All to yourself
What if I was to break your heart
Who would be dumb enough to
Lose all that I have got for you
All to myself
All to yourself
You've got to finish what you start

Haha I can give you that haha
Let me give you that hahahahaha

Na na naii
Oo na na noww


Yo I like when you wear them material things
But I like it more when you try my hat on with the strings
And do the impression of me when I say na na naii
I aint gonna lie no more you must have done a lot
For the body and the back off and the brain that youve got
It's simple if I start I wont stop
I mean Youre so intelligent with such a high IQ
So if I ever have a baby id love it to be with you


The way she smiles at me every time she sees me its crazy
Im proud to call her my lady
Like daps said, she the type of I girl I wanna see holding my baby
And she don't get excited whenever my job pays me
But if I'm on the phone she don't act right
So I try to keep them well away
So I don't have to stop a catfight
Cant say I never said I wasn't that type
Truly you really confuse me
And thats why


I don't quite understand
What you're trying to say (straight up)
Can you make it clearer?
I just want you nearer
See everyone around me keeps on saying that
I must be blind (well don't you understand)
Shut up!

All I'm tryin to say is that
Wouldn't you wouldn't you
Like to have me to yourself
All to myself
All to yourself
What if I was to break your heart

All to myself
All to yourself

Haha I can give you that haha

Na na naii
Oo na na noww


Whatever what would a girl like you want from a rebel like me?
Got no money in the bank just stuck in a council estate


Together, were gonna be closer to the dream
Its like we're just you and me so its up to you


I don't quite understand
What you're trying to say (straight up)
Can you make it clearer?
I just want you nearer
See everyone around me keeps on saying that
I must be blind (well don't you understand)
Shut up!
