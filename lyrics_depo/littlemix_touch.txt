You and I and nobody else
Feeling feelings I never felt
The way you got me under your spell
Don't you keep it all to yourself

So won't you take it, I feel like for the first time I am not faking
Fingers on my buttons and now you're playing
Master of anticipation
Don't you keep it all to yourself

Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
Just a touch of your lo-ove
Just a touch of your lo-ove
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your lo-ove
Just a touch of your lo-ove

Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
Just a touch of your lo-ove
Just a touch of your lo-ove
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your lo-ove
Just a touch of your lo-hey-ove

Photograph with no T-shirt on
Why you making me wait so long? (Wait so long)
I promise to keep this a secret, I'll never tell
But don't you keep it all to yourself

So won't you take it, I feel like for the first time I am not faking
Fingers on my buttons and now you're playing
Master of anticipation
Don't you keep it all to yourself (To yourself)

Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Just a touch)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Just a touch)
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Just a touch, just a touch)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Just a touch, just a touch)

Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week (knock me off my feet)
Just a touch of your love, hey
Just a touch of your love, hey
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body (body)
Just a touch of your love, hey
Just a touch of your lo-hey-ove

And now my whole week, my whole week is golden (yeah)
Can you see me glowing? That's how I feel (feel)
And I'm not afraid to fade into emotions (yeah)
'Cause I know that this could be something real (oooh)

Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week (knock me off my feet)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (hey)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (just a touch)
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body (body)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Only a touch of your love)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (One touch of your)

Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
Just a touch of your love, hey (Just a touch)
Just a touch of your love, hey (Just a touch, yeah)
