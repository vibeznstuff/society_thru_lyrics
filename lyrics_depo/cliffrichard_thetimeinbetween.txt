I watch the sun every morning I see the moon at night
But there's a time, time in between That I don't see a light,
I don't see it, no no no
That I don't see a light

I hear your footsteps in the hall I hear your knock on the door
But there's a time, time in between That I don't hear you there at all,
I don't hear you, no no
That I don't hear you there at all

The way you used my love
It makes me cry, it makes me cry
The way you threw me up
It makes me die, it makes me die

I watch the sun every morning I see the moon at night
But there's a time, time in between That I don't see a light,
I don't see it, no no
That I don't see a light

But there's a time, time in between
That I don't hear you there at all, not at all, no no
That I don't hear you there at all

The way you used my love
It makes me cry, it makes me cry
The way you threw me up
It makes me die, it makes me die

I watch the sun every morning I see the moon at night
But there's a time, time in between
That I don't see a light,
I don't see it, no no no
That I don't see a light, light, light, light, light
