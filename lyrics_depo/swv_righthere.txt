Lately there seems to be
Some insecurities
About the way I feel
Where I wanna be
Boy, you know is with you
No one can do 
The things you do
To me

Never to be mistaken
Long as it's love we're making
There's gonna be some rain
Gonna beat the pain
But as long as I know
Boy, time will show
Our love will grow
And I know


Love will be right here
Be right here
Right here
Be right here
No fear
Have no fear
No tears
Love is here

True love some don't believe in
That's just what I'm givin'
I'm gonna keep it strong
I'll be holdin' on
To you
No one can do
Me like you do
It's true

Sure as the sun is shining
Our love will keep on climbing
There's gonna be some rain
Gonna beat the pain
But as long as I know
Boy, time will show
Our love will grow
And I know
