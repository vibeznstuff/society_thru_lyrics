It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart, I feel it too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
with or without you 

(hey..yeah)
Baby I don't understand
Just why we can't be lovers
Things are getting out of hand
Trying too much, but baby we can't win 

Let it go
If you want me girl, let me know
I am down, on my knees
I can't take it anymore 

It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you 
But when we are apart, I feel it too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
with or without you 

(oohhh...alright)
Baby don't mis-understand (don't misunderstand)
What I'm trying to tell ya
In the corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
Baby, it feels like we are running out of time 

Let it go
If you want me girl, let me know
I am down on my knees
I can't take it anymore..ohhh 

It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you 
But when we are apart, I feel it too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
with or without you 

Tearin' up my heart and soul
We're apart I feel it too
and no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you 

Tearin' up my heart and soul (alright)
We're apart I feel it too (I feel it too)
and no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you 

It's tearin' up my heart (tearin' up my heart and soul) when I'm with you 
But when we are apart, I feel it too (we're apart I feel it too)
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
with or without you 

And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you
