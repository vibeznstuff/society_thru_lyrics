I'll take you back to 1969
Let's hit the city of freedom, like old times
It's getting dirty
Underneath the blue sky
Imagine you and me count the butterflies

One, two, three
Let's bring it on
Keep on dancing in the streets of love
French kissing on JFK drive
Till we crash at the beach
Where we watch the sun rise

Tell me what you waiting for

We're crossing the golden gate
Party at the frisco bay


Wake me up in San Francisco

We knew the power is in your head, girl
Party everywhere, girl

I Wake me up in San Francisco

Where the love is in the air
All the people stop and stare

Baby take me back to the city of love
To the place that I've been dreaming of

San Francisco...

Wake me up in San Francisco


It's 10 pm
Getting ready for the night
Wanna be a hippie when the city's getting high
I'm cruising down broadway, you on my side
Pulling over my pink rover at the hungry eye

One, two, three
Let's bring it on
Dj play my favorite beats
All night long
Poppin' some bottles, champagne, red wine
And we both giddy up on the rooftop
And watch the city lights

Tell me what you waiting for

We're crossing the golden gate
Party at the frisco bay


Wake me up in San Francisco

We knew the power is in your head, girl
Party everywhere, girl

I Wake me up in San Francisco

Where the love is in the air
All the people stop and stare

Baby take me back to the city of love
To the place that I've been dreaming of

San Francisco...

Wake me up in San Francisco


We're playing songs of life
Like it's 69
We singing, dance, under the sun of san francisco
Stars shine so bright on the city tonight

We're crossing the golden gate
Party at the frisco bay


Wake me up in San Francisco

We knew the power is in your head, girl
Party everywhere, girl

I Wake me up in San Francisco

Where the love is in the air
All the people stop and stare

Baby take me back to the city of love
To the place that I've been dreaming of

San Francisco...

Wake me up in San Francisco

C'mon take me back to the city of love
To the place that I've been dreaming of

I Wake me up in San Francisco
