We should pop more champagne this year
Than we did last year
And we should live like it's the only life we get
There's nowhere else past it
And as the DJ plays the sparkles fly
Like fireworks have gone off
We got our glasses up and bottles high
And if you don't that's your loss

So we should live it up
Put something in your cup
Too much is not enough
Put your glasses up
Toast to the good life that we're livin'
Up, there's no one here but us
There's never too much love
Too much is not enough
Let's live it up
Let's live it up

There should be nobody sitting
Wanna tear the roof down
Put your palms up if you're with me
Got nothing to lose now
Got the shots going around the room
And it's all on me yeah
You should call your friends and tell your crew
They should really be here

So we should live it up
Put something in your cup
Too much is not enough
Put your glasses up
Toast to the good life that we're livin'
Up, there's no one here but us
There's never too much love
Too much is not enough
Let's live it up
Let's live it up


Ha! Skinny fly, big icy watch
The rolls going wild
The car ain't got no top
I'm into ballin', and being cocky and showing off
Single-handedly killing y'all
Don't get involved
Big rims, big girlfriends
Been in the party bumping on waterbeds
Two by the leg
Two by the head
It's crazy, driving miss Daisy
Got white girls going crazy
Damdama, last king bandana
Break them bitches off
I ain't gonna hammer
K.M in the Panamera
Front seat, relax, looking sexy

So we should live it up
Put something in your cup
Too much is not enough
Put your glasses up
Toast to the good life that we're livin'
Up, there's no one here but us
There's never too much love
Too much is not enough
Let's live it up
