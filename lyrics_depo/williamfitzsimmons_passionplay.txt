I should not have hid
Where my heart can't follow
Cause this grace gets so far
And too hard to swallow
I've been running from Saul,
He's been giving chase
When I look in his eyes
All I see is my face

Are you still on my back
After all these years?
Chasing me out of hell
And my nice veeners
I don't know how you stand
When you've got no floor
Or how you can breathe
With your hands on boards

I just want to be not what I am today
I just want to be better than my friends might say
I just want a small part in your passion play

Do you hear when I call
In the midst of wrong?
Do you hear these here words
While I sing this song?
Are you caught up in me
Like I heard you say?
Or just some big cashier
That I'll have to pay
