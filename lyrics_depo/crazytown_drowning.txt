Everything is so complex
Everyday is like a test full of obstacles
That seem almost impossible

And I’m thinking just another breath not a minute left.
How long have I been drifting?

Pass the glass pint hit the flash light now break it.
People say I’m a star but I still think ill never make it.

And I’m thinking just another prayer not a second left. 
I feel there’s something missing

Sometimes I hate that chaos  surrounds me when all the answers that I see go around me.
Am I drowning?
Am I fading away?
OR am I living up to all your dreams that made me this way?
Am I drowning?
Am I drowning?
Am I drowning?
Am I drowning? 

I’ve been to hell and back looking for the answers to life.
Looking at myself trying to get things right.

And I’m feeling just another breath not a minute left.
I feel the darkness lifting. 

There was a time
That  I questioned if Id ever be alright.
Running getting high staying trapped by sleepless nights. 

And I’m thinking just another breath not a minute left.
I feel there’s something missing. 

I’m running from myself and all the things I don’t like.
Living every night like it’s the last night.

And I’m thinking just another prayer not a second left.
I need to stop resisting.

Sometimes I hate that chaos  surrounds me when all the answers that I see go around me.
Am I drowning?
Am I fading away?
OR am I living up to all your dreams that made me this way?
Am I drowning?
Am I drowning?
Am I drowning?
Am I drowning? 

Drowning in the drama lost in the lies trapped by the currents of life caught in the rip tides.

Am I drowning?
