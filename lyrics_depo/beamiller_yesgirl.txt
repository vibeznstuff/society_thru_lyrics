Could tell you what you wanna hear
Cause the truth is always in the way
I never wanna live in fear
I don't wanna hold back all the things I need to say
Say, say

I got you figured out, you need to have control
You think that I don't know you, I know you, I know
Trying to tell you now, I've been doing what you want
But I won't be your yes girl, no, not anymore
Just let me go, just let me go
Won't be your yes girl, no, not anymore
Just let me go, just let me go
Won't be your yes girl, no, not anymore

You used to always let me in
Do you even know you changed?
And now you're my favorite sin, oh
Cause I'm either on your side or you're a mile away

I got you figured out, you need to have control
You think that I don't know you, I know you, I know
Trying to tell you now, I've been doing what you want
But I won't be your yes girl, no, not anymore
Just let me go, just let me go
Won't be your yes girl, no, not anymore
Just let me go, just let me go
Won't be your yes girl, no, not anymore

No, I won't do it anymore
I won't do it anymore

I got you figured out, you need to have control
You think that I don't know you, I know you, I know
Trying to tell you now, I've been doing what you want
But I won't be your yes girl, no, not anymore
Just let me go, just let me go
Won't be your yes girl, no, not anymore
Just let me go, just let me go
Won't be your yes girl, no, not anymore
Not anymore
