I'm looking for someone
In this old crazy world tonight
I can't take this heartbreak
In this old crazy world tonight

I'm feeling so empty
In this old lonely world tonight
I'm restless, defenceless
In this unholy world tonight

Oh, I never learn

Oh, lonely night
Disappear
Oh, lonely night
Don't you come 'round here
Oh, lonely night
Lonely, lonely night

I'm waiting for something
To put these foolish things to right
Protected, accepted
I need it now, I need it right

I'm feeling so empty
In this old lonely world tonight
I'm restless, defenceless
In this unholy world tonight

For love we burn
We never learn
We never learn

Oh, lonely night
Disappear
Oh, lonely night
Don't you come 'round here
Oh, lonely night
Disappear from here

Oh, lonely night
Disappear
Oh, lonely night
Don't you come 'round here
Oh, lonely night
One more

Oh, lonely night
Disappear from my door
Oh, lonely night
Don't you come 'round here no more
Oh, lonely night
Disappear from my door
Oh, lonely night
Don't you come 'round here no more
