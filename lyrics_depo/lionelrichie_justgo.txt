It'd be so nice
If you didn't have to feel so lonely
It'd be so nice
If I could sneak you for a moment

I know you like to get away, go away, far away
To a place where there's just us two
Got a busy day, everyday but not today
'Cause I'm here to take that stress from you

So you can just chill and clear your head
And let me do everything for you
'Cause you deserve it
Prepare your meal and make your bed
Well, let just first make this with you
'Cause you are so worth it

I just want us to go
(Go, go)
Drop everything and just go
(Go, go)

I just want us to go
(Go, go)
Drop everything and just go
(Go, go)

How would you like to sail away in the Bahamas?
(Just you and me, girl)
So far out in the sea where nobody can find you
(Just the end of the world)

'Cause there is no rush
For you to come back and face the rain
'Cause there is plenty sunshine where I picking you
And I'm here to reduce the pain

I know you like to get away, go away, far away
To a place where there's just us two
Got a busy day, everyday but not today
'Cause I'm here to take that stress from you

So you can just chill and clear your head
And let me do everything for you
'Cause you deserve it
Prepare your meal and make your bed
Well, let just first make this with you
'Cause you are so worth it

I just want us to go
(Go, go)
Drop everything and just go
(Go, go)

I just want us to go
(Go, go)
Drop everything and just go
(Go, go)

Just imagine when you tired and
Laying by my side and
Sipping on some wine while I stand in massage
And releasing all your tension I couldn't handle a time
And my job is to keep my baby smiling

So you can just chill and clear your head
And let me do everything for you
'Cause you deserve it
Prepare your meal and make your bed
Well, let just first make this with you
'Cause you are so worth it

I just want us to go
(Go, go)
Drop everything and just go
(Go, go)

I just want us to go
(Go, go)
Drop everything and just go
(Go, go)

I just want us to go
(Go, go)
Drop everything and just go
(Go, go)

I just want us to go
(Go, go)
Drop everything and just go
(Go, go)
