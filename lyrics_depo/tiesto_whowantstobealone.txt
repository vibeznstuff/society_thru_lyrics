i was waiting for you to notice me
i been hanging around for a minute
baby dont give me u it wont hurt me
i dont even know if u deserve me

but with that moon in the sky
who wants to be alone
and when the stars shine so bright
who wants to be alone

dont take me home till the sun comes up till the sun comes up 

right next to me
you wanna be
till the sun comes up

i am goin nowhere in a hurry
baby come take away all my worries

but with that moon in the sky
who wants to be alone
and when the stars shine so bright
who wants to be alone

dont take me home till the sun comes up till the sun comes up 

right next to me
you wanna be
till the sun comes up

im out of my head 

but with that moon in the sky
who wants to be alone
and when the stars shine so bright
who wants to be alone

dont take me home till the sun comes up till the sun comes up 

right next to me
you wanna be
till the sun comes up
