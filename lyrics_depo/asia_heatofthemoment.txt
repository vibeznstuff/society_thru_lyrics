I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
A look from you and I would fall from grace
And that would wipe the smile right from my face

Do you remember when we used to dance
And incidents arose from circumstance?
One thing led to another, we were young
And we would scream together songs unsung

It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what my heart meant
The heat of the moment shone in your eyes

And now you find yourself in '82
The disco hot-spots hold no charm for you
You can't concern yourself with bigger things
You catch the pearl and ride the dragon's wings

'Cause it's the heat of the moment
The heat of the moment
The heat of the moment shone in your eyes

And when your looks are gone and you're alone
How many nights you sit beside the phone?
What were the things you wanted for yourself?
Teenage ambition you remember well

It was the heat of the moment
Telling you what your heart meant
The heat of the moment shone in your eyes

It was the heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment shone in your eyes

Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment

Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
