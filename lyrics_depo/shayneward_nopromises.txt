Hey baby, when we are together doing things that we love.
Every time you're near I feel like I’m in heaven feeling high
I don’t want to let go, girl.
I just need you to know, girl.

I don’t wanna run away, baby, you’re the one I need tonight.
No promises.
Baby, now I need to hold you tight, I just wanna die in your arms here tonight
