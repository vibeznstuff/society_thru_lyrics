Will I be alone this morning
Will I need my friends
Something just to ease away the pain
And now I never see the loneliness
Behind my face
I am just a prisoner to my faith

If I could only stand and stare in the mirror could I see
One fallen hero with a face like me?
And if I scream, could anybody hear me?
If I smash the silence, you'll see what fame has done to me

Kiss away the pain and leave me lonely
I'll never know if love's a lie
Ooh - being crazy in paradise is easy
Do you see the prisoners in my eyes?

Where's the love to shelter me
Give me love, come set me free
Where's the love, to shelter me
Only love, love set me free
Set me free



Kiss away the pain and leave me lonely
I'll never know if love's a lie
Ooh - being crazy in paradise is easy
Do you see the prisoners in my eyes?

Where's the love to shelter me
Give me love, come set me free
Where's the love, to shelter me
Only love, love set me free
Set me free
