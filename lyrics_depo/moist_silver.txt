So close your eyes
Your christ has come
The crippled boy that you once knew
The charmed enigma chosen one
With painted lips
Skin ripped and torn
Come touch and feel and lick and smell
This envy that I've worn so well

Everybody wants
Everybody says
Everybody begs
In time

So drink me in
Like tainted wine
Come bite down on my sharpened cup
And taste the dreams that numb the mind
A simple word
A harmless glare
That binds me with the thinnest thread
And pins me down to pleasure's bed

Everybody wants
Everybody says
Everybody begs
In time

You will be the first to fall
Every feeling will dissolve
We are silver
Morphine baby's final breath
Every breath into my breast
We are silver

So shy and poised
With few regrets
A Judas kill, a complex thrill
A memory I won't soon forget
Been washed out clean
Till all runs dry
Come touch and feel and lick and smell
The hurt that only you could sell

Everybody wants
Everybody says
Everybody begs
In time

You will be the first to fall
Every feeling will dissolve
We are silver
Morphine baby's final breath
Ever smothered to my breast
We are silver

Sister, I will follow you this time
Knowing I will follow you

Everybody wants
Everybody says
Everybody begs
In time

And you will be the first to fall
Every feeling will dissolve
We are silver
Morphine baby's final breath
Ever smothered to your breast
We are silver
Silver
Silver (we are silver)
Silver
Silver (we are silver)
