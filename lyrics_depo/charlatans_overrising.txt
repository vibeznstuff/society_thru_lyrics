Hey, hey some missionary
Boil at 100 degrees
No one before has ever known what you're after 
But who wants to know?

Standing here I've always known that you wanted to get your hands onto my place
Forsaken I know she's got a bad time coming 
But who wants to know

Ease yourself down on me

Over rising, washing me down again
Over rising, washing me down and now you're dragging me out

Holding me down and now you'll obviously strip me
Of all the possessions I own
Nobody cares as long as you can remember
That he's the only god who drops you down

Ease yourself down on me

Over rising, washing me down again
Over rising, washing me down and now you're dragging me out

Over rising, washing me down again
Over rising, washing me down and now you're dragging me out

Over rising, washing me down again
Over rising, washing me down and now you're dragging me out
