We came down from the north
Blue hands and a torch
Red wine and food for free
A possibility
We share our mothers' health
It is what we've been dealt
What's in it for me
Fine, then I'll agree

Trees there will be
Apples, fruits maybe
You know what I fear
The end is always near

Trees there will be
Apples, fruits maybe
You know what I fear
The end is always near

Say you like it
Say you need it
When you don't
Looking better
Shining brighter
Than you do

Say you like it
Say you need it
When you don't
Looking better
Shining brighter
Than you do

Say you like it (Trees there will be)
Say you need it (Apples, fruits maybe)
When you don't (You know what I fear, the end is always near)
Looking better (Trees there will be)
Shining brighter (Apples, fruits maybe)
