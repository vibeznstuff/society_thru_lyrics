This kind of love
Is more than a lifeline
For a man as weak as me
Who has no self believe

This kind of love
Is more than amazing
For a man who lost his way
Who thought it was too late

How did the sea?
How did the sea?
How did the sea?
Get so rough
I would've drowned, I would've drowned
If you hadn't given me your love

You're the light in the dark
You're the seat in the park
You're the lighthouse
You're the lighthouse
That I need
You're the key to the door
You're the port in the storm
And I need to find a shore
When I can't swim anymore
You always guide me back to solid ground
You're my lighthouse

This kind of love
Is more than a feeling
For a man who really cried
I get all choked up each time
You say you love me
You could've walked away
Could've give my problems back
Could've left
You took the chance

How did the waves?
How did the waves?
How did the waves?
Get so high
I would've died, I would've died
If you hadn't loved me just in time

You're the light in the dark
You're the seat in the park
You're the lighthouse
You're the lighthouse
That I need
You're the key to the door
You're the port in the storm
When I need to find a shore
Cos I can't swim anymore
You always guide me back to solid ground
You're my lighthouse

Yeah, I owe it all to you
Everything I have right now
I owe it all to you
Everything I didn't have you found
Everytime take me back to you

You're the light in the dark
You're the seat in the park
You're the lighthouse
You're the lighthouse
I need You're the key to the door
You're the port in the storm
And I need to find the shore
Cos I can't swim anymore
You always guide me back to solid ground
You're my lighthouse
