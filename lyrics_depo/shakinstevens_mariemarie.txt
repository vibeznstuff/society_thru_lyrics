Marie Marie, playing guitar on the back porch
I sit in my car, while she sings so sad Marie Marie

Marie Marie, It's so lonely in these farmlands
Please come with me, to the bright lights downtown Marie Marie

I said: "hey, pretty girl, don't you understand
I just want to be your lovin' man"

Marie Marie, the sun is down in the cornfields,
The evening is dark, and you sing so sad Marie Marie

Marie Marie, I got two weeks in back pay,
There's gas in my car, and your folks say I must go Marie Marie

I said: "hey, pretty girl, don't you understand
I just want to be your lovin' man"

Marie Marie, playing guitar on the back porch
I sit in my car, while she sings so sad Marie Marie.
