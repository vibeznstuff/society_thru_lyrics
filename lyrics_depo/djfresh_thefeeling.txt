This feeling, this feeling, this feeling
This feeling, this feeling, this feeling

Such a good feeling, this feeling
I can't stop myself feeling
Such a good feeling, this feeling
I can't stop myself feeling

Living tomorrow is easy as that
If you want me far though I'm not coming back
I've canceled my credit, I've switched up my phone
I'm leaving it all behind
'Cause I see this vision when I close my eyes
Surrounded by bright white and indigo skies
The feeling's electric as if paradise
Has come to take over my mind

Oh-oh-oh-oh, such a good feeling, this feeling
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I can't stop myself feeling
Oh-oh-oh-oh, such a good feeling, this feeling
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I can't stop myself feeling

When the darkness pulls you under
When the water feels too deep
I will lead you to the feeling, oh-oh-oh
And I will give you what you need, oh-oh-oh

This feeling, this feeling, this feeling
Oh-oh, this feeling, this feeling, this feeling
Yeah, yeah

Such a good feeling
Such a good feeling, this feeling
I can't stop myself feeling
Such a good feeling, this feeling
I can't stop myself feeling

Oh-oh-oh-oh, such a good feeling, this feeling
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I can't stop myself feeling
Oh-oh-oh-oh, such a good feeling, this feeling
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop

Such a good feeling (I can't stop)
Such a good feeling (I can't stop)
Such a good feeling
I can't stop myself feeling
The feeling, the feeling
This feeling, this feeling
This feeling, this feeling
I can't stop myself feeling
I'll leave it to the feeling
