You're crying now just like I used to cry before. (rain, rain, rain)
Turn off the tears, girl; I don't care any more.
You can save all your lies, 'cause I've heard them all
Before:
Tell it to the rain
And the stars that shine above,
That it's me you're thinking of,
And that I'm your only love--
Tell it to the rain.

I gave you love, girl, and got nothing in return.
How does it feel to feel what I had to learn?
Baby, don't say you're sorry, 'cause I'm just not
Concerned:
Tell it to the rain
And the stars that shine above,
That it's me you're thinking of,
And that I'm your only love--
Tell it to the rain.

Tell it to the rain
And the stars that shine above,
That it's me you're thinking of,
Oh, forget it, love--
Tell it to the rain.

Tell it to the rain
And the stars that shine above,
That it's me you're thinking of,
And that I'm your only love--
Tell it to the rain.
