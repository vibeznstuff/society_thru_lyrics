Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah-yeah
Ooh-ooh
Eah-eah-eah
Oh

What's there to say, there's not much to talk about
And whatever happened to all of the love that we vowed
Yes, it's true
And there's nothing new
You can say

Give me the reason to want you back
Why should I love you again
Do you know, tell me how
How to forgive and forget

Give me the reason to love you now
It's been a mighty long time
And the love that used to be
Ended the day you walked out

Never knew I'd ever be
Standing a love and outside
With no one to love

Yeah-eah
Ooh-ooh-eah

I was secure and so glad there was you to love
What in the world would I ever do without us
But it's getting clear
That I have to get over you

Give me the reason to want you back
Why should I love you again
Do you know, tell me how
How to forgive and forget

Give me the reason to love you now
It's been a mighty long time
And the love that used to be
Ended the day you walked out

Never knew I'd ever be
Standing a love and outside
With no one to love

No one, no one to love
No one, no one to love
No one, no one to love
No one, no one to love

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
You, ooh-eah-eah

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Give me the reason to want you back
Why should I love you again
Do you know, tell me how
How to forgive and forget

Give me the reason to love you now
It's been a mighty long time
And the love that used to be
Ended the day you walked out

Give me the reason
To love you, girl
To love you, girl
To love you, girl
To love you, girl
To love you, girl

Give me the reason
To love you, girl
To love you
To love you, girl
Ooh

To love you, girl
To love you, girl
To love you, girl
To love you, girl
