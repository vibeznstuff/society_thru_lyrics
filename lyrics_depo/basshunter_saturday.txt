Its a quarter to three,
I think I'm going crazy,
Out of the control now, out of the control now
Chasing down the raving crowd,
I see someone acting out of the control now,
Out of the control now

Baby, baby won't you help take it down
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Baby, baby c'mon help me get down
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

'Cause it's Satur-Saturday
Ain't nobody here to take eh, eh, eh
'Cause it's Satur, 'cause it's Satur-Saturday
Everybody wants to play eh, eh, eh

I like to move, it move it, dontcha like to lose it
I like to do it, do it, I like to do it, do it
I like to move it, move it, I'm about to lose it
I like to do it, do it, people like to move it

When your dancing up to me girl
You make me go out of the control now, out of the control now
C'mon show me what you've got,
Dancing 'till we're out of the control now, out of the control now

Baby, baby won't you help take it down
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Baby, baby c'mon help me get down
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

'Cause it's Satur-Saturday
Ain't nobody here to take eh, eh, eh
'Cause it's Satur, 'cause it's Satur-Saturday
Everybody wants to play eh, eh, eh

I like to move it, move it, dontcha like to lose it
I like to do it, do it, I like to do it, do it
I like to move it, move it, I'm about to lose it
I like to do it, do it, people like to move it

I feel the beat tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
C'mon get closer,
Closer to me tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
