Birds fly, we turned finally free
Patience lost, I began to lose me
My advice would be take a breath
Close your eyes and take a step

I wasn't scared, I fought this on my own
You pulled me down and I let you go
I told you I would prove you wrong
And now I'm here and I'm standing strong

I know (I know, I know)
I know (I-I know, I know)
I know (I know, I know)
That I ain't got far to go, go, go
Cause I spent forever waiting
And it's no longer a dream
And now I've landed on my feet
And I ain't got far to go

H-h-h-hold tight, rollercoaster, here we go
Florida, Orlando, I ain't playing with you
Day one, I said I'd go for me
One box ticked, got a lot to beat

I wasn't scared, I fought this on my own
You pulled me down and I let you go
I told you I would prove you wrong
And now I'm here and I'm standing strong

I know (I know, I know)
I know (I-I know, I know)
I know (I know, I know)
That I ain't got far to go, go, go
Cause I spent forever waiting
And it's no longer a dream
And now I've landed on my feet
And I ain't got far to go

I'm here to stay, I'm here to stay
Amen (amen), amen (amen)
And if I had to go back in time
I would just do it again (again), again (again)
Hey, hey hey, I ain't got far to go
Hey, hey, I know, I ain't got far to go

I know (I know, I know)
I know (I-I know, I know)
I know (I know, I know)
That I ain't got far to go, go, go
Cause I spent forever waiting
And it's no longer a dream
And now I've landed on my feet
And I ain't got far to go
Cause I spent forever waiting
And it's no longer a dream
And now I've landed on my feet
And I ain't got far to go
