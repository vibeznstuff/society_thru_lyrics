You got my body shaking, sends a shiver to my soul
I didn't get no warning, you got me shaking to the bone
I got my secret weapon, I'm gonna get you alone, yeah yeah
So let your body loose control

I was a boy walking tough, king of the street
Believed in making my own destiny, yeah
Victim of love, I made a promise that I'd never be
Another one of love's fatalities

Rule number one was running wild and always running free
Didn't need no luck, my guardian angel looking over me
You passed me by, I got the vibe, left me in disbelief
Arrow to my heart, at hurricane velocity
You pierced my emotional armour
Bolt of lightning couldn't hit me harder


You got my body shaking, sends a shiver to my soul
I didn't get no warning, you got me shaking to the bone
I got my secret weapon, I'm gonna get you alone, yeah yeah
So let your body loose control

Everybody say I aim too high out of my league
I've gotta step into reality, yeah
Different sides, different styles, certain tragedy
I got you in my sights so please believe it's harmony
You pierced my emotional armour
Bolt of lightning couldn't hit me harder


You got my body shaking, sends a shiver to my soul
I didn't get no warning, you got me shaking to the bone
I got my secret weapon, I'm gonna get you alone, yeah yeah
So let your body loose control
