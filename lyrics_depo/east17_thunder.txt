When the thunder calls you
From a mountain high
It's time to spread your wings and fly

When the thunder calls you
Under purple sun
To the place where horses run

When I saw your face
I knew you were the one
In a sky that's filled with rain

A ray of sun
I called you on the phone
Said, You're happy on your own

When I heard your body cry
For my love
Your body's calling me
Your body's calling
I think I'm falling

Whoa
A picture in my mind
A vision in a dream
When the storm destroyed
The bridge I walked across

Have you ever felt alone
When you stood within a crowd
On a path you thought you knew
But feel alone

I'm all confused
Like a child with a choice of toy
So much to gain, so much to lose
Like a pain you endure more than enjoy

I guess I'm going crazy
Everyone's telling me so
Do you feel the same?
Well that's all I need to know
