You and me
We used to be together
Everyday together
Always
I really feel
That I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe
This could be the end

It looks as though you're letting go
And if it's real
Well, I don't want to know

Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Our memories
They can be inviting
But some are altogether
Mighty frightening
As we die,
Both you and I
With my head in my hands
I sit and cry

Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
(No, no, no.)
Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

It's all ending
We gotta stop pretending who we are

You and me
I can see us dying.
Are we?

Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
(No, no.)
Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts!

I know what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't speak,
Don't speak,
Don't speak, oh

I know what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
I know you're good,
I know you're good,
I know you're real good, oh,

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
Don't, don't, uh-huh

Hush, hush darlin'
Hush, hush darlin'
Hush, hush
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Hush, hush darlin'
Hush, hush darlin'
Hush, hush
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
