Don't mess with Dr. Dream
Don't mess with Dr. Dream.

Come lay your head down on the stone
So cool and white and welcome home.
Oh, lose your troubles
Ease your pain
Soothe your soul in golden rain.

Blue marble seas (I will make you feel so good) roll over me.
Blue marble dreams (like you always knew you would) roll over me.

Don't mess with Dr. Dream
Don't mess with Dr. Dream
He's not one for sympathy.
Don't mess with Dr. Dream
Don't mess with Dr. Dream
He will bring you to your knees.

In the hours before the dawn,
You curse the day that you were born.
Those demons scream in ecstasy and you crawl around in agony.
Doctor jeers and fades away
Yeah, this is the price that you must pay.

Blue marble seas (I will make you feel so good) roll over me.
Blue marble dreams (like you always knew you would) roll over me.
Don't take that, take this!

Take this!

He's not one for sympathy
He will bring you to your knees.
Oh, lose your troubles
Ease your pain
This is the price you must pay.

Don't mess with Dr. Dream
Don't mess with Dr. Dream
He's not one for sympathy.
Don't mess with Dr. Dream
Don't mess with Dr. Dream
He will bring you to your knees.
Don't mess with Dr. Dream
Don't mess with Dr. Dream
He's not one for sympathy.
Don't mess with Dr. Dream
Don't mess with Dr. Dream
He will bring you to your knees.

Don't take that
Take this!
