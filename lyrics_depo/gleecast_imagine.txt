Imagine there's no countries 
It isn't hard to do 
Nothing to kill or die for 
And no religion too 

Imagine all the people 
Living life in peace (you) 
You may say I'm a dreamer 

But I'm not the only one 
I hope someday you will join us 
And the world will live as one 

Imagine no possession 
I wonder if you can 
No need for greed or hunger 
A brotherhood of man 

Imagine all the people 
Sharing all the world (you) 

You may say I'm a dreamer 
But I'm not the only one 
I hope someday you will join us 
And the world will live as one
