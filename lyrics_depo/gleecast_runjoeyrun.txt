Daddy please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy please don't
We're gonna get married
Just you wait and see

Every night, the same old dream,
I hate to close my eyes
I can't erase the memory,
The sound of Julie's cry

She called me up, late that night
She said, "Joe, don't come over,
My Dad and I just had a fight
And he stormed out the door

I've never seen him act this way,
My God, he's goin' crazy
He said he's gonna make you pay
For what we done, he's got a gun
So run, Joey run, Joey run!"

Daddy please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy please don't
We're gonna get married
Just you wait and see

Got in my car, drove like mad
'Til I reached Julie's place,
She ran to me, with tear-filled eyes
And bruises on her face

All at once I saw him there,
Sneakin' up behind me (Watch out!)
Then Julie yelled, "He's got a gun!"
And she stepped in front of me

Suddenly, a shot rang out
And I saw Julie falling
I ran to her, I held her close
When I looked down, my hands were red!
And here's the last words Julie said...

Daddy please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy please don't
We're gon...na get... mar...ried...
