Yeh yeh yeh
Sometimes you're acting the fool
Sometimes you're breaking the rules
Sometimes you want to run away
Sometimes you stay out of school

But it's a dirty old town and you know where it's where we all belong,
Tell your mama back home coz she was just the same when she was young
I want to give you some advice

Lock up your daughters right now 
It will give you a smile on your face
Lock up your daughters somehow
This is the time ' the time and the place.

Sometimes you whip up a storm
Don't get to bed until dawn
Sometimes you get a little high
You'll wish you'd never been born

Well it's a crazy old world everybody's got to get along
Tell your mama back home coz she was just the same when she was young
I tell you right now.

Lock up your daughters right now 
It will give you a smile on your face
Lock up your daughters somehow
This is the time ' the time and the place.

You'd better lock up your daughters right now 
It will give you a smile on your face
Lock up your daughters somehow
This is the time ' the time and the place.

Lock up your daughters right now 
It will give you a smile on your face
Lock up your daughters somehow
This is the time ' the time and the place.
