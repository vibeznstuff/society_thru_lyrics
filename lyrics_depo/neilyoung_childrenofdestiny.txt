Stand up for what you believe
Resist the 'powers that be'
Preserve the land and save the seas
For the children of destiny
The children of you and me

Should 'goodness' ever lose and 'evil' steal the day
Should 'happy' sing the blues and 'peaceful' fade away
What would you do?
What would you say?
How would you act on that new day?

Stand up for what you believe
Resist the 'powers that be'
Preserve the ways of democracy
So the children can be free
The children of destiny

When money matters most and war is good for gain
The capital is yours, the people feel the pain
They feel the pain, they walk the streets
While the bombs fall in the rain
The children hide, somewhere inside
While the bombs fall in the rain

Stand up for what you believe
Resist the 'powers that be'
Preserve the land and save the seas
For the children of destiny
The children of destiny
