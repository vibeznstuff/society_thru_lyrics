This time we run
This time we hide
This time we draw on all the fire we have inside.
We need some time 
To find a place
Where I can wipe away the madness from your face.

Our name is out
Our name is known
Our name is everywhere but who knows where we're flown.
I never meant 
To kill a man
But I will show you how to live like no one can.

So look away look away
Hide your eyes from the land where I lie cold.
Look away look away 
From the lies in the stories that were told.
Look away look away 
From the love that I hide way down deep in my soul.

I met you wild 
In a snowed up town
When I was waiting tied and bound to be sent down.
Then I broke loose
You weren't around
So I raised banks and trains until I tracked you down.

Now look away look away
Hide your eyes from the land where I lie cold.
Look away look away 
From the lies in the stories that were told.
Look away look away 
From the love that I hide way down deep in my soul.

You followed me 
When I said no
You lay with me when there was nowhere safe to go.
We made some friends
but now it's done
I always knew that we would never find the sun.

So look away
look away
Hide your eyes from the land where I lie cold.
Look away look away 
From the lies in the stories that were told.
Look away look away 
From the love that I hide way down deep in my soul.
