You're an emotional wreck
You don't know who you are
You never say what you mean
And you keep your mouth shut
And your knife stays still
And then you come and call on me

You say I just can't help myself
I really really wish I could be somewhere else
than here

And I met a girl
she asked me my name
I told her what it was
She looked at me
I tried to explain
Exactly what I lost

But now I just can't help myself
I really really wish I could be somewhere else
Than here
You give me everything I need
but I really really wish I could be somewhere else
Than here

Just anywhere else
Just anywhere else than here

And I wont forget
No I wont forget
No I wont forget

And when I saw you there it was the first time
And you just walked on by
I was catching the sparks that flew from your heels
And trying to catch your eye

But that was
somewhere else
somewhere else
somewhere else
I really really wish I could be
somewhere else
somewhere else
somewhere else
I really really wish I could be
'Cause I just can't help myself
I really really wish I could be somewhere else
than here

And no I just can't help myself
I really really wish I could
I've got everything I need
I really really wish I could be
somewhere else
somewhere else
somewhere else
I really really wish I could be
