If I told you how I feel about you
Would you say the same and
If I wrote it in a letter
Would you keep it or throw it away

I never thought I'd feel the way I'm feeling lately
When everything you seem to do just drives me crazy

Every waking day you take my breath away
With every word you say you take my breath away
You look at me that way, baby come what may
I hope that you'll always know how to take my breath away
How to take my breath away
You told me how you feel about me
Cos I did not know
If you said you'd fill my heart with all your loving
Til it overflowed
I don't know the way you feel but boy I'm hoping
I always used to hide a way, but now I'm open
Every waking day you take my breath away
With every word you say you take my breath away
You look at me that way, baby come what may
I hope that you'll always know how to take my breath away
How to take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Every waking day you take my breath away
With every word you say you take my breath away
You look at me that way, baby come what may
I hope that you'll always know how to take my breath away
How to take my breath away
(How to take my breath away)
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
(How to take my breath away)
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
