Broke dick dog
My head slung low
Tail knocked in the dirt

Time and time of being told
Trash is all I'm worth

When I was just a young boy
Had to take a little grief
Now that I'm much older
Don't put your shit on me


Grab it and shake
Reach down scrape it
You just got to


Primal scream &amp; shout
Let that mother out
You just gotta say "hey"
Primal scream &amp; shout
Oooh tear it out
You just gotta say

Janou said
Meters are red
Blow a neurotic fuse Show a little
A little pain
Unlock a lotta truth

When daddy was a young man
His home was living hell
Mama tried to be so perfect
Now her mind's a padded cell, ya







Hey man, get out of my face
I deal with my problems at my own pace
With your screwed-down, anti-human views
Deal with the pressures by playing the blues
If you wanna live life on your own terms
You gotta be willing to crash and burn



Scream shout
Come on come on come on
Scream shout
