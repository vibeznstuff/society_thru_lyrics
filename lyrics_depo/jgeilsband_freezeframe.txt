Freeze frame

I could see it was a rough-cut Tuesday
Slow-motion weekdays stare me down
Her lipstick reflex got me wound
There were no defects to be found
Snapshot image froze without a sound

Thursday morning was a hot-flash factor
Her face still focused in my mind
Doo-dloo-dloo
Test-strip proofsheet love is hard to find

Doo-dloo-dloo
Friday night, we danced the spotlight grind
Doo-dloo-dloo
Stop time heart for me if she's not mine

Freeze frame, freeze frame
Freeze frame, freeze frame
Freeze frame, freeze frame
Freeze frame, whoo, and I freeze

Now I'm looking at a flashback Sunday
Zoom lens feeling just won't disappear
Doo-dloo-dloo
Close up, dark room, sweet talk in my ear

Doo-dloo-dloo
Her hot-spot love for me is strong
Doo-dloo-dloo
This freeze-frame moment can't be wrong

Freeze frame, freeze frame
Freeze frame, freeze frame
Freeze frame, freeze frame
Freeze frame, whoo, and I freeze

Shoot, shoot - doo-dloo-dloo
Shoot, shoot - doo-dloo-dloo
Shoot, shoot - doo-dloo-dloo

Freeze frame, freeze frame
Freeze frame, freeze frame
Freeze frame, freeze frame
Freeze frame, whoo, and I freeze

Yeah

Freeze frame, oh yeah, freeze frame
If I could freeze frame, freeze frame, freeze frame
If I could freeze, she's real, whoo, freeze frame
If I could freeze, she's ahhh, freeze frame
If I could shoot, shoot - doo-dloo-dloo, freeze frame
If I could shoot, shoot - doo-dloo-dloo, freeze frame
