Whoo!
Yeah, darkchild
B-Rock let's go

Why don't you return my calls?
Why you trip out where I be?
You don't ever come to see me
You say that you're too busy (what?)

What the hell?
I don't have time
Why you messin' with my mind?
I can find another guy
Someone who will treat me right

I don't need this bullshit
I won't put up with it, any longer
You can, go if you want
I don't, need you pity
I will, be just fine
If you decide, that you want to leave
Close the, door behind you
I just, want to know what...

What about all of the
Things that you say
What about all of the
Promises that you made
What about all of the
Nights that you gave
What about all of the
Things you told me
What about all of the
Things that you say
What about all of the
Promises that you made
What about all of the
Nights that you gave
What about, what about
What about us? What about us, us?
What about us? What about us, us?

I thought you said you were different
Was that what I heard you say?
Said that you'd love only me
Thought that you'd be all I need (what?)
What happened to promises?
Said that you were a better man
Your words have no way with me
Cause you're counterfeit, I see

I don't need this bullshit
I won't put up with it, any longer
You can, go if you want
I don't, need you pity
I will, be just fine
If you decide, that you want to leave
Close the, door behind you
I just, want to know what...

What about all of the
Things that you say
What about all of the
Promises that you made
What about all of the
Nights that you gave
What about all of the
Things you told me
What about all of the
Things that you say
What about all of the
Promises that you made
What about all of the
Nights that you gave
What about, what about
What about us? What about us, us?
What about us? What about us, us?

Baby you should now hear this...
Now what if I said that you wasn't fit to be with
Now what if I told you you're game was played, I licked it
Yo what if I said I wasn't true, so do you
You and I know, without me there's no you
So what about the bills that were passed due
Before you, all you said to me was "Baby I'll owe you"
Forget about the brand new life that I gave you
Now what about us to me, now what about us to me

What about all of the
Things that you say
What about all of the
Promises that you made
What about all of the
Nights that you gave
What about all of the
Things you told me
What about all of the
Things that you say
What about all of the
Promises that you made
What about all of the
Nights that you gave
What about, what about
What about us? What about us, us?
What about us? What about us, us?

What about all of the
Things that you say
What about all of the
Promises that you made
What about all of the
Nights that you gave
What about all of the
Things you told me
What about all of the
Things that you say
What about all of the
Promises that you made
What about all of the
Nights that you gave
What about, what about
What about us? What about us, us?
What about us? What about us, us?

Oh, oh, oh, oh...
