You gotta hope for the best and the best looks good now baby
and I don't think a few words of sympathy will make your world go round
I'm sitting here looking at the TV burning holes in everything that I get
You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

I love you like I love the sun in the morning
But I don't think a few words of mine are gonna make you change your mind
I'm gonna spend the day in bed and I'm planning on sleeping my life away
You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

You've gotta hope for the best and the best looks great now baby
and I don't think a few words of mine are gonna make your world go round
I'm sitting here looking at the TV burning holes in everything that I get
You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

You'd better come right down and do it all over again.
