(One, two, three, four)

I wish someone would explain to me
How losing you is gonna make me feel
Like someone shot a hole in me
And left me out for the wolves to eat

You're in my blood
You're in my bones
On my mind wherever I go
Can you hear me?
I miss you today
Hey-hey-hey, it's just not the same
Hey-hey-hey

And I still drive by your old house
Fight back tears and turn the music loud
Your favorite song, my LCD Soundsystem is always on repeat

You're in my blood
You're in my bones
On my mind wherever I go
Can you hear me?
I miss you today
Hey-hey-hey, it's just not the same
Hey-hey-hey
I miss you today
Hey-hey-hey
And I'd give it all away if I could get you back

And I can't hold on
I can't hold on
I can't hold on
I can't hold on

You're in my blood
You're in my bones
On my mind wherever I go
Can you hear me?
I miss you today
Hey-hey-hey, it's just not the same
Hey-hey-hey
I miss you today
Hey-hey-hey, it's just not the same
Hey-hey-hey
And I'd give it all away if I could get you back

And I can't hold on
And I can't hold on
And I can't hold on
And I can't hold on

It's just not the same
I miss you today
