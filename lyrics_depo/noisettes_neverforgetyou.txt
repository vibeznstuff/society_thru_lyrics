Watcha drinkin'?
Rum or whiskey?
Now won'tcha have a
Double with me?

I'm sorry I'm a little late
I got your message by the way
I'm calling in sick today
So let's go out for old time's sake

I'll never forget you
They said we'd never make it
My sweet joy
Always remember me

We were mischievous
And you were always wearing black
I was so serious
You know my boyfriend's mother nearly had a heart attack

I'm sorry I'm a little late
You know the stripes on a tiger are hard to change
I know this
World feels like an empty stage
I wouldn't change a thing
So glad you're back again

I'll never forget you
They said we'd never make it
My sweet joy
Always remember me

I'll never forget you
At times we couldn't shake it
You're my joy
Always remember me

We just got swallowed up
You know I didn't forget you
We just got swallowed up
We just got swallowed up
And you know that I didn't forget you
We just got swallowed up
By the whole damn world

Watcha thinkin'?
Did you miss me?
I borrowed your silver boots
Now if you'd just let me give them back to you,

I'll never forget you
They said we'd never make it
My sweet joy
Always remember me

I'll never forget you
Although at times we couldn't shake it
You're my joy
Always remember me

Don't you know that you're my joy?
Always remember me
Don't you know that you're my joy?
Always remember me
