What what
You're barking up the wrong tree
The spotlight's on me
Style of the Fumin, howl with the moon
How you gonna buss if there's no room?
What, it's the style of the Fume
Get the dough and move style with the Fume
Know what I stab
Right in the tune
Dough involved I'm right in the mood


Oooooerr, ooooer
Cause with the riddim I'm on
Spit the lyric bang on
Fit the riddim bang on
While your lyrics dem a just drag on
It's me the kids are mad on
When I clap mic you know it's flame on
Better get the game on
To get the game boy then come and bring it on


I'll... crack your skull
Leave you fucked up in a wheelchair
If you try to clash this evil breh
And again
I'll... crack your skull
Leave you fucked up in a wheelchair
If you try to clash this evil breh




Rude boy fi just seckle
Don't let Jamakabi ga draw fi da metal
Not da gun, me draw for da belt buckle
I make a bigger boy feel so likkle
Just swing my belt round like a nun chuckle
Bust your head and make your blood start trickle
One more lick fi make da pussy hole topple
Greet da breda with a fistful of knuckle


Killa killa real real
Niggas know the deal deal
Don't care how you feel
I will be cockin' back my steel, straight
Bullets bullets run run
Fire fire bun
If you don't like killa killa
Nigga you can suck your mom


Fi start bun a MC
Bun fire pon a batty boy MC
Pick up my hour disrespect me
Man I go step in a him face with my new Nikey's

Alright prick I'll knock you on the beat

You don't really want to beef


Anyway I told you already we nah play
Spray this wank MC right away
He's chatting shit about he's got an AK
Armshouse comes and the boy runs away
It's 2 double 04, niggas don't play
Streets are mine if you force I will slay
You sound so gay, I'm gonna call you fake
Don't care about your crew, bun them anyday


You don't wanna bring arms-house
I'll bring arms-house to your mum's house
You don't wanna bring no beef
Bring some beef you'll loose some teeth

I'll bring arms-house to your mums house
You don't wanna bring no beef
Bring some beef you'll loose some teeth




You got a gun troll shoot it
You'll say it bounce so shoot it
What you waitin for you, shoot it
No one needs to show you how to hold a gun
Shoot it shoot it shoot it
You nah shoot it if you nah true to it
You puff you better mute it
If you nah mute it, da glove come off ga mute it
Put it in your mouth like a tooth pick
