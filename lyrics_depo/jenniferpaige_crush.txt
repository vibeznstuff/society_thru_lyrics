Ah crush ah

See you blowin' me a kiss it doesn't take a scientist
To understand what's goin' on baby
If you see somethin' in my eye, let's not overanalyze
Don't go too deep with it baby

So let it be what it'll be
Don't make a fuss and go crazy over you and me
Here's what I do, I'll play it loose
Not like we have a date with destiny

It's just a little crush
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha la la la, sha la la la

It's raisin' my adrenalin, you're bangin' on a heart of tin
Please don't make too much of it, baby
Say, "That we're forever more"
That's not what I'm lookin' for, all I can commit to is maybe

So let it be what it'll be
Don't make a fuss and go crazy over you and me
Here's what I do, I'll play it loose
Not like we have a date with destiny

It's just a little crush
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha la la la, sha la la la

Vanilla skies
White picket fences in your eyes
A vision of you and me

It's just a little crush
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha la la la, sha la la la

Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha la la la, sha la la la

Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do
