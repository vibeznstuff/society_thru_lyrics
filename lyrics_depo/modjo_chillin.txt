One night in a disco
Chillin' with my friends
Feelin' kind of low
I was sitting on a fence
Suddenly I saw her
Dancing on the scene
Just like in a dream
She would set my heart on fire

I feel so high
Dancing all night
You blow my mind
'Cos you're so fine

She had such a swing
Anyone could see
Her body meaning things
That look so good to me
Music got my head
Spinning all around
She got me in a trance
Just by the way she danced

I feel so high
Dancing all night
You blow my mind
'Cos you're so fine

I feel so high
Dancing all night
You blow my mind
'Cos you're so fine

I feel so high
Dancing all night
You blow my mind
'Cos you're so fine

(She had such a swing) I feel so high
(Anyone could see) Dancing all night
(Her body meaning things) You blow my mind
(That look so good to me) 'Cos you're so fine
(Music got my head) I feel so high
(Spinning all around) Dancing all night
(She got me in a trance) You blow my mind
(Just by the way she danced) 'Cos you're so fine

(Music got my head) I feel so high
(Spinning all around) Dancing all night
(She got me in a trance) You blow my mind
(Just by the way she danced) 'Cos you're so fine

(Music got my head) I feel so high
(Spinning all around) Dancing all night
(She got me in a trance) You blow my mind
(Just by the way she danced) 'Cos you're so fine
