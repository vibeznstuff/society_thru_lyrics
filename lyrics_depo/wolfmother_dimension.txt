I fell down in the desert baby, yeah
I had nothing but a peice of paper, oh yeah,
I had to write something down,
And I found myself alone, then I let go of everything,
Into another dimension

Purple haze is in the sky,
See the angels wicked eye
all these things we must try
'Till we see the reasons why, oh yeah

Lightning crash on the hill tonight,(yeah)
I got a feeling everything is gonna be alright
Then a horse came running to me
Said we're gonna go to the sanctuary
Then a storm began to blow,
Into another dimension.

Purple haze is in the sky,
See the angels wicked eye
all these things we must try
'Till we see the reasons why, oh yeah

I got lost in the desert baby, yeah
I found temples made out of paper, oh yeah
I had to write something down
But then i found myself alone
Then i let go of everything
Into another dimension
