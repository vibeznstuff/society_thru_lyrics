I came to tell you 
How it all began 
Nothing seems to work out right 
I'm broken down again 
So hold me now 
And say it's not forever 
Maybe someday 
In time 

Things will go my way 
Things will go my way 

I've pushed to get through 
The crowds in twisted souls 
Just to find I'm right back here 
Doing what I'm told 
So take my hands 
Don't let me surrender 
'Cuz maybe someday 
Yeah, in time 

Things will go my way 
Things will go my way 

For all the lies 
I've tasted 
Just looking for the truth 
For all the dreams I'm chasing 
Well what am I to do 
When everything's against me 
The answers are all wrong 
I'm hoping that I'll find out 
It was worth it all along 

So hold me now 
And say it's not forever 
Maybe someday 
In time 

Things will go my way 
Things will go my way 
Things will go my way 

For all the lies 
I've tasted 
Just looking for the truth 
For all the dreams I'm chasing 
Well what am I to do 
When everything's against me 
The answers are all wrong 
I'm hoping that I'll find out 

Things will go my way 
Things will go my way
