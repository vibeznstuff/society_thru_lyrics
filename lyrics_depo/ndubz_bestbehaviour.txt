Drag my bags off the plane today
 A little too much fun on tour.
Lord please help me find my keys
or I'm banging down my own door.
All the cheering, all the applause
 who could ask for more?
Now I wouldn't mind finding a real thing
ready when my bags finally hit the floor.

See I need some kind of lady that will feed me daily
every time I come home she'll be waiting for me.
cuz I been thinking lately that life alone is crazy
I wanna hold somebody when I sleep.
(Hahaahaaa)

Who's gonna be the one to save me?
Will I ever settle down? All I do is run around
This is taking too long.


 Love is all I need, I've waited all my life
You got me on my best behaviour ohh uuaah ohhh

Hurry up I'm in danger baby ohh uuaah ohhh
how long before you save me baby?


I just finished the tour today
and my bags dropped to my door
walked up to an empty room
and now I'm crying on my own floor
All the bright lights and all the surprises
tell me what they mean

If I'm standing on a stage infront so many people
and I feel like its just me
see I need some kind of man that can understand me.
The female boss is who I have to be.
Sometimes I get lonely.
I just need to hold me. 
then I might let them be the boss of me
(Hahaahaaa)
