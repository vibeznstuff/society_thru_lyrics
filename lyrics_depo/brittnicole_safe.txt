You keep trying to get inside my head
While I keep trying to lose the words you said
Can't you see I'm hanging by a thread
To my life, what I know
Yeah, I'm losing control and

Oh no
My walls are gonna break
So close
It's more than I can take
I'm so tired of turning and running away
when love just isn't safe

You're not safe, mmm-mm

I'm strong enough
I've always told myself
I never wanna need somebody else
But I've already fallen from that hill
So I'm dropping that guard,

Oh no
My walls are gonna break
So close
It's more than I can take
I'm so tired of turning and running away

Oh no
My walls are gonna break
So close
It's more than I can take
I'm so tired of turning and running away
when love just isn't safe

Oh no
My walls are gonna break
So close
It's more than I can take
I'm so tired of turning and running away
when love just isn't safe

You're not safe
And that's okay
