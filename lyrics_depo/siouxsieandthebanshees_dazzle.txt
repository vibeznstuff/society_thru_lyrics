The stars that shine and the stars that shrink
In the face of stagnation the water runs
Before your eyes...

Swallowing diamonds
A cutting throat
Your teeth when you grin
Reflecting beams on tombstones

A jamboree of surprises
Playing Russian roulette
Or the Lucky Dip
A clenched fist to your heart
Coal dust on your lungs

A silver tongue for the chosen one
Heavy magnum in your side or a bloody thorn
Skating bullets on angel dust
In a dead sea of fluid mercury
Baby piano cries
Under your heavy index &amp; thumb
Pull some strings -- let them sing

The stars that shine and the stars that shrink
In the face of stagnation the water runs
Before your eyes...
Dazzle -- It's a glittering prize
Before your eyes...
It's a glittering prize...
