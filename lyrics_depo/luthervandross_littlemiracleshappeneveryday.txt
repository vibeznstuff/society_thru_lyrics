One thing I would love to do
Is talk to someone
Wish I knew who
Sometimes the people who know the least say the most
Makes you wonder who you can trust
What's gonna happen

The first thing I know
God is love
The next thing would be
He loves me
Sometimes I'm tired of waiting for a thing or someone
Then I stop and see what He's done
And I know everything will come

And it maybe today
Anything can change, nothing stays the same
And maybe today
What's tomorrow for
No one knows for sure
Through it all come may
Little miracles happen everyday

And so there you go
Strangely enough
Alone even so
Addicted to love
You're in and out so quickly
That it gives you a start
You're waiting for a message or a word
But you haven't heart from your heart

But it might be today
Anything can change
Nothing stays the same
And maybe today
For the love in me
I really believe
Through it all come what may
Little miracles happen everyday

What is a miracle
Love is a miracle
Every time that you care
Miracles happen somewhere
So many miracles
Even small little miracles
Just take one look about
It's not hard to figure out

Cause it might be today
Anything can change
Nothing stays the same
And maybe today
What's tomorrow for
No one knows for sure
Through it all come what may
Little miracles happen everyday
Little miracles happen everyday
