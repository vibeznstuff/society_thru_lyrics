Eleanor put those boots back on,
Kick the heels into the Brooklyn dirt,
I know it isn't dignified to run,
But if you run,
You can run to the Coney Island roller coaster,
Ride to the highest point and leap across the filthy water,
Leap until the Gulf Stream's brought you down.

I could be there when you land 

So Eleanor take a Green Point three point,
Turn towards the hidden sun,
You know you look so elegant  when you run,
If you run, you can run,
To that statue with the dictionary,
Climb to her fingernail and leap, yeah,
Take an atmospheric leap,
Leap and let the jet stream set you down.

Could be there when you land,
I could be there when you land,
Could be there when you land.

So Eleanor put those boots back on,
Put the boots back on and run, run,
Come on over here, come on over here,
Come on over here...
