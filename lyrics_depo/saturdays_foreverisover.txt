I was caught in a place far away
From the light
What I saw
I couldn't face
So I closed my eyes

Wish I could turn back the page
Re-write my point of view
Save all the time you waste (got to get gone, gone)
Don't let it escalade
Don't fight, it's just no use
There's nothing left to say
Got to get gone, gone, gone

Forever is over
And my hearts not gonna fight
Forever is over
And I'm no longer afraid
Cuz if I don't get out now
I may never escape
Your power is fading away and
I'm getting so stuck to the place
I belong
Forever is over
Over, over, over, over, over

I don't want you to tell me
You found someone
Cuz I got no distance left to run

Wish I could turn back the page
Re-write my point of view
Save all the time you waste (got to get gone, gone)
Don't let it escalade
Don't fight, it's just no use
There's nothing left to say
Got to get gone, gone, gone

Forever is over
And my hearts not gonna fight
Forever is over
And I'm no longer afraid
Cuz if I don't get out now
I may never escape
Your power is fading away and
I'm getting so stuck to the place
I belong
Forever is over
Over, over, over, over, over

I'm on the other side
And now I realize
I'm in paradise coz
You're out my life

Forever is over
And my hearts not gonna fight
Forever is over
And I'm no longer afraid
Cuz if I don't get out now
I may never escape
Your power is fading away and
I'm getting so stuck to the place
I belong
Forever is over
