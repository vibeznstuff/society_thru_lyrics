We're the gangsters of the groove
Got a contact out on you
We're the syndicate of soul
Gonna take control

Check out the stiff that sits in the corner
Don't you know that could be you
Jump on the riff, we're givin' the orders
Watchin' everything you do

Don't try to squeal
We'll be gunnin' you down
Got the deal
Spread the message around
That the mob is hitting town tonight

We're the gangsters of the groove
Got a contact out on you (There ain't a chance that you'll survive)
We're the syndicate of soul
Gonna take control (You've got to join the winning side)

We're the bandits of the beat (Yeah)
Gonna dance you off your feet (There ain't a word that you can say)
Better do just what you're told
Let the good times roll (Come on and join us all today)

Don't try to hide, there ain't no protection
Even from the FBI
Don't call the cops, just follow directions
If you wanna stay alive

Dress up to kill (Lay your life on the line)
For the thrill (Be a partner in crime)
Of the wildest sound that's goin' down

We're the gangsters of the groove
Got a contact out on you (There's no excuses left to use)
We're the syndicate of soul
Gonna take control (We're tired of livin' in the blue, yeah)

We're the bandits of the beat
Gonna dance you off your feet (There ain't a word that you can say)
Better do just what you're told
Let the good times roll (You've got to try us out today)

Stand and fire up the nation
With a brand new point of view
Got to fight the depression
Let the world know what the family could do
Here tonight, baby
Ooh...hoo...

Gangsters of the groove
We're comin' after you
Gangsters of the groove
We're comin' after you

We're the gangsters of the groove
Got a contact out on you (There's no excuses left in you)
We're the syndicate of soul
Gonna take control (We're tired of livin' in the blue)

We're the bandits of the beat
Gonna dance you off your feet
(Wanna dance, I wanna dance, I wanna dance you off, dance you off)
Better do just what you're told
Let the good times roll

We're the gangsters of the groove
Got a contact out on you (There ain't excuse that you can use)
We're the syndicate of soul
Gonna take control

We're the bandits of the beat
Gonna dance you off your feet
