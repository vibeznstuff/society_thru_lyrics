
She's in love with you
That's all she wants to do
She'll never let you down,
She'll never fool around
'Cos she's in love with you

So if you see her all alone 
One night walk up to her discreetly
Ask her why
And if she replies with words 
That don't make sense it maybe
Just because she's shy
Don't take advantage of her
Lack of understanding just because
You think you could
Treat her right, treat her good
Take her home and make her 
Feel the way she should


She's in love with you
That's all she wants to do
She'll never let you down,
She'll never fool around
'Cos she's in love with you
She's in love with you
That's all she wants to do
She'll never let you go,
She may not let you know
But she's in love with you

So if you happen to be out 
One night as someone asks you
Where you're gonna go
Just remember she's not like the other girls
She may not want them all to know
Though she may need a little time
She never wants to stand in line
The way they would
So treat her nice, treat her good, 
Treat her like you know you should
You may never find another girl like her



So take her home and hold her close
Touch her where she feels it most, but be true
And when she's makin love to you, 
She'll do what you want her to
Treat her good, treat her like you know you should
You may never find another girl like her
