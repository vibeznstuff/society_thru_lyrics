Take me down, take me all the way down tonight
Soon I'll be leaving
Break me down, break me all the way down
Before the night is over

Let's get lo-o-o-ost
Let's get lo-o-o-ost
Let's get lo-o-o-ost
Let's get lo-o-o-ost


What it is?
What it could be?
My imagination runs fast
Only if you coming with me
4AM staying up past
However long these drugs last
Don't know why I live so fast
They be telling me to slow down
I be screamin' out "Fuck that"

I really want to take you down
Moanin' is how I wanna make you sound
Can't wait until I get you home
Fuck that I wanna take you now
Let's do it all
Have a ball
Hook up tonight in the ladies room stall
Follow you there I'll let you make the call
You can text all your friends say you'll see them tomorrow
Well

Yeah, that's if you're down
She'd never fucked the first night until now
Let me plow, faded
I'm drunk off the brown
Stay up all night on the town
Act like tomorrow just doesn't exist
Time isn't real ain't shit on my wrist
Let go of everything, then you have bliss
Then she told me this


Take me down, take me all the way down tonight
Soon I'll be leaving
Break me down, break me all the way down
Before the night is over

Let's get lo-o-ost
Let's get lo-o-ost
Let's get lo-o-ost
Let's get lo-o-ost


Let's get lost tonight
You can be supreme Kate Moss tonight
Turn up in a SoHo loft tonight
Do drugs take ten shots tonight
Awesome I'm naked with Naked &amp; Famous jeans on the floor
Livin' wild life you ain't seen this before
You should give brains and I mean this for sure
That's what genius is for

Beautiful girl that I just met on tour
Another good girl that I'll probably destroy
Her life was stable until she met me
Sheltered and safe so she never gets free
But she loves trouble she's drawn to the danger
Never goes crazy, I bet I can change her
I can make her fall in love with a stranger
Switch up the pace, I don't mean Danny Granger
Look

Can't wait til tomorrow
Fine with today
You're pretty as fuck
And I'm trying to slay
Let's do this right now is what I'm trying to say
I could tell you don't love him
You're dying to stray
I do not give a fuck 'bout your ex
I'm not looking for love
I'm just looking for sex
Tension between us had me feeling vexed
Then she sent me a text


Take me down, take me all the way down tonight
Soon I'll be leaving
Break me down, break me all the way down
Before the night is over

Let's get lo-o-o-ost
Let's get lo-o-o-ost
Let's get lo-o-o-ost
Let's get lo-o-o-ost

Oh oh...


That's that endless summer
Never going back to school
We do what we wanna
Can't tell me no rules
Every night on the town
Going out all the time
And I'm tryna take you down
Only thing on my mind


Take me down, take me all the way down tonight
Soon I'll be leaving...
