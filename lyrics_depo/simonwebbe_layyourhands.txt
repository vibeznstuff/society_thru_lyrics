Sometimes life can be a burden 
Trine stay one step ahead 
I feel the world upon my shoulder each time
I'm standing out on the edge 
And my hopes have all deserted me
Like they washed away in the sand
And it's hurting my pride 
Trine survive 
But i know i stand a chance

When you lay your hands 
Oh yeah
`Caus it's the only thing I have that still makes sense 


(Oh baby, when I`m calling out) 
Give me love and affection,
Keep telling me, show me the way.
(Oh, if you see me falling down)
Lift me up from the shadows
Will you take me away to a better place?
(And when I`m in my darkest hour)
You`re by my side, to turn the tide,
Until the suffering fades.
When life is getting me down,
Getting me down, i`m close to defeat,
Come and lay ur hands on me.

Feel this road is getting longer now 
And i`m too far away from home 
Still I gotta keep on moving on 
But I can`t do it on my own 
Baby keep my head above water 
Help me swim for my life
`Coz the game is getting harder 
The strain is gettin stronger 
And I can only face the fight 

When you lay your hands 
Oh yeah
`Coz it`s the only thing I have that still makes sense



`Til I`m healed again,
Rediscovered my strengths,
Those bitter blues are gone...
Oh, gone...


Come and lay your hands on me.
