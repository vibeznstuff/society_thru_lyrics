P-P-P-Play it
Let's get a little information to work with

Aah, love you love you
Aah, love you love you


Don't tell me that it's no use
Love's always been my excuse
Don't tell me it ain't right
My heart is my alibi


Only you (you), you (you)
Get me acting crazy
Like I do (do), do (do)
You say you can't believe it but it's true, ooh, ooh
It's true, ooh, ooh


What do I have to do
To get the message through
How can I prove that I really love you, love you
What do I have to do
To get it through to you
How can I prove that I really love you, love you


There ain't a single night
When I haven't held you tight
But it's always inside my head
Never inside my bed

And it's you (you), you (you)
Bringing out the passion 
In my soul (oh), oh (oh)
And I gotta have you
Don't you know, oh, oh
Don't you know, oh, oh



Love, love you
Love, love you
Love, love you
