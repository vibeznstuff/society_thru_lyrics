I don't remember much about that time,
Just the smell of the air and your hand in mine.
Riding the strip, sittin' on my lap
In the back of the truck with the only friends I had.

It was spring break, we were out late,
And I though goodness for heavens sake.
When I saw you...
And then I kissed you...

On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
We made love as the waves rolled in
And we owned that town for one weekend.

Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the sound of the boat
Starting up, heading out of the bay
Girl you... faded away.

I still taste the shots on your lips that night,
And the smoke from the club still burns my eyes
Feel of your body takin' off your dress,
Waking up that morning in a tangled mess.
So if I'da known, I'da held on...
A little bit longer and stronger with nothing to lose,
Cause I still see you...

On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
We made love as the waves rolled in
And we owned that town for one weekend.

Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the sound of the boat
Starting up, heading out of the bay
Girl you... faded away.

On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
I watched you drive through the gate
Without saying the words I needed to say.

Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the tears on your face
And the sun going down that day
Girl you... faded away.
You faded away.
