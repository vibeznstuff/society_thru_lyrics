There's a song playing on the radio
Sky high in the airwaves on the morning show
And there's a lifeline slipping as the record plays
And as I open the blinds in my mind I'm believing that you could stay

And oh if you stay
I'll chase the rainblown fields away
We'll shine like the morning and sin in the sun
Oh if you stay

We'll be the wild ones
Running with the dogs today

There's a song playing through another wall
All we see and believe is the d.j. and the debts dissolve
And it's a shame the plane is leaving on this sunny day
'Cause on you my tattoo will be bleeding and the name will stain

And oh if you stay
We'll ride from disguised suburban graves
We'll go from the bungalows
Where the debts still grow each day

And oh if you stay
I'll chase the rainblown fears away
We'll shine like the morning and sin in the sun
Oh if you stay

We'll be the wild ones
Running with the dogs today
We'll be the wild ones
Running with the dogs today

Oh if you stay
Oh if you stay
Oh if you stay
...
