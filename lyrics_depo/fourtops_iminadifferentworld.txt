In this world of ups and downs
My dreams all fall through
Things just don't work out
No matter what I do

Disappointment haunts me
Through each lonely day
The world around I see
In only shades of gray

But when the love light shines upon my face
I'm in a different world
A world I never knew
I'm in a different world
A world so sweet and true
I'm in a different world

I'm no longer just another face
In a crowd
Hey, look into my eyes
You'll see I'm strong and I'm proud

You are all the sweetness
Of my life, you see
You have brought heaven
Right here on earth to me

No man of wealth
I know I'll ever be
But I'll be satisfied
Just knowing you love me

On the stage of life
I've played a loser's part
It seems like I've been down
Right from the very start

Every time I lift myself
Up off the ground
Something always happens
To bring the curtain down

But when your love light shines upon my face
I'm in a different world
A world so warm and sweet
I'm in a different world
Now that you've been loving me
I'm in a different world

Each time you speak my name
Or put your hand in mine
The empty life I knew
I leave it far behind

'Cause you gave me the love
That I truly felt
Most of all, you made me
Believe in myself

You're more than a love to me
You're my way of life
I'll forever cherish you
More each day and night

Ah
I'm in a different world

A world that's warm, a world that's sweet
A world that's every bit complete
A world that's real, you've made me see
All the beauty surrounding me

Ah, look what you've done for me
Ah, look what you've done for me

I'm in a different world
Now that you've been loving me
I'm in a different world
And that's where I want to be

I'm in a different world
Now that you've been loving me
I'm in a different world
And that's where I want to be

I'm in a different world
Now that you've been loving me

I'm in a different world
Now that you've been loving me
I'm in a different world
And that's where I want to be
