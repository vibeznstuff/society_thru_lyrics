Oops, my baby, you woke up in my bed
Oops, we broke up, we're better off as friends
Now I accidentally need you, I don't know what to do
Oops, baby, I love you

It started with "What's up with you?"
I messed around and got caught up with you
Yeah, yeah, I don't know what to do
I caught these feelings like there's nothing new
Now I can't get enough of you

And when I think about the way you touch my body
I don't know how long I can wait
And when I think about the way you touch my body
This could be my greatest mistake
You've got me singing

Oops, my baby, you woke up in my bed
Oops, we broke up, we're better off as friends
Now I accidentally need you, I don't know what to do
Oops, baby, I love you

We had a good run
We messed around and had some good fun
Guess it turns out I lost a good one
'Cause now I'm wishing every morning would come
With you next to me, baby

And when I think about the way you touch my body
This could be my greatest mistake
You've got me singing

Oops, my baby, you woke up in my bed
Oops we broke up, we're better off as friends
Now I accidentally need you, I don't know what to do
Oops, baby, I love you

Oh I love, I love, I love you

Now I accidentally know that you're in love with me too
Oops, baby, I love you

If it was up to me
I would take a time machine to the day I said goodbye, I lied
Oh, I lied
So can we try again?
Beneficial, more than friends
No, don't you tell me goodbye
You've got me singing

Oops, my baby, you woke up in my bed
Oops, we broke up, we're better off as friends
Now I accidentally need you, I don't know what to do
Oops, baby, I love you

I love, I love, I love you
Oh, I still love you, yeah

Now I accidentally know that you're in love with me too
Oops, baby, I love you
