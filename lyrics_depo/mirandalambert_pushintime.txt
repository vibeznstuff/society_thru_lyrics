Are we fools for rushin' in,
'Cause I already dread the end.
Lonely ain't no place to start;
I guess that's just where we are.

Oh, how I remember well 
Sunset on September 12.
I disappeared to get a drink; 
You still kept your eyes on me

Sometimes love acts out of spite,
And good things happen overnight.
Can't take it slow 'cause you and I are pushing time

I didn't plan on fallin' fast;
I didn't know I could be kissed like that.
Now I'm tradin' miles for minutes.
This bed's too big without you in it.

Sometimes love acts out of spite,
And good things happen overnight.
Can't take it slow 'cause you and I are pushin' time

You and I are pushin' time

And they say only time can tell,
You already know me well.
If it has to end in tears, 
I hope it's in sixty years.

Sometimes love acts out of spite,
And good things happen overnight.
Can't take it slow 'cause you and I are pushin' time.
Can't take it slow 'cause you and I are pushin' time.
