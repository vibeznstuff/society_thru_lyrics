In the club party rock, lookin' for your girl,
She on my jock (huh) non-stop when we're in the spot
Booty move the weight like she owns the block
Where I drank I gots to know
Tight jeans, tattoos cause I'm rock and roll
Half black half white, domino
Gain the money Oprah Doe!

Yo!
I'm running through these hoes like Drano
I got that devilish flow rock and roll no halo
We party rock yeah! that's the crew that I'm repping
On a rise to the top no lead in our Zeppelin
