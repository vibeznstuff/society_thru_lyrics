Do you love me? 
Or am I just another trip in this strange relationship? 
You push and pull me
and I'm about to loose my mind 
Is this just a waste of time 
keep acting like you own me 
I keep running, watch me walking out that door 
I hear you behind me

Gimme that strange relationship
Never felt pleasure and pain like this
Something so right but it feels so terribly wrong
I keep holding on
Gimme that strange relationship
One of us gotta let go of this
I keep pushing and you keep holding on
I'm already gone

Do you love me? 
We break up and back together
And I swore to myself never
Oh how you do me
You strip me of my honor
And I don't ever think I'm gonna
Break free of these mind games
All I'm trying to do is modify my plan
'Cause I can't contain you

Gimme that strange relationship
Never felt pleasure and pain like this
Something so right but it feels so terribly wrong
I keep holding on
Gimme that strange relationship
One of us gotta let go of this
I keep pushing and you keep holding on
I'm already gone

You keep acting like you own me
I can't control me
You said you never really wanted me back
Well maybe if that's a fact 
May I suggest
A brand new plan of attack
And in defense of that you're hard to crack 
You're way off track
I want you back, I want you gone
Maybe I'm sick of holding on

Do you love me? 
Or am I just another trip in this strange relationship? 

Gimme that strange relationship
Never felt pleasure and pain like this
Something so right but it feels so terribly wrong
I keep holding on
Gimme that strange relationship
One of us gotta let go of this
I keep pushing and you keep holding on
I'm already gone
