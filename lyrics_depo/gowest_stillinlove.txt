I can still remember
How you first captured me
Stars in my eyes
Promising forever
There would be no more tears
And no more goodbyes..
Tell me we're

Still in love
Am I the only one
Still in love?
Am I the one you've been dreaming of?
'cause I'm still in love with you..

There will be temptation
Certain as gravity-
Hard to defy
But even in temptation
If it is strong enough
Then love will survive..
Tell me we're

Still in love
Am I the only one
Still in love?
Am I the one you've been dreaming of?
'cause I'm still in love with you
Just say you remember me baby

Tell me we're still in love
Am I the only one
Still in love
Am I the one you've been dreaming of?
'cause I'm still in love with you
Still in love with you..

And if all I have to do
Is stay true to you
Well if that's all it takes
To get through to you
I'm ready girl - I've got nothing to hide..

Still in love
Am I the only one
Still in love..
