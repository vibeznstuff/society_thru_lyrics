I gave you my heart right from the start, yeah yeah
I gave you my heart now you tear it apart
You wrote me a letter - you found someone better
Better than me, this I can't believe

When I come home, tell me all about it
When I come home, tell me all about it

I work all day earning my pay, yeah yeah
I work all night to make you feel alright

When I come home, tell me all about it
When I come home, tell me all about it
