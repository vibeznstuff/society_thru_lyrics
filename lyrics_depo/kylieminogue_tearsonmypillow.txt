
You don't remember me
But I remember you
T'was not so long ago
You broke my heart in two


Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you


If we could start anew
I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate




Love is not a gadget
Love is not a toy
When you find the one you love
She'll fill your heart with joy






Caused by you
