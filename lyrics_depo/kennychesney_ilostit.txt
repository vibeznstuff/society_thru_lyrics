I had a hundred dollar ring in my hand 
So weak and tired i could barely stand 
From being up all night, prayin' she'd say yes 
So with a hopeful heart i hit one knee 
With a tear in her eye she looked at me 
It was the moment of truth, i was scared to death 
My life hung on what that tear meant 
Then she smiled at me 
And I lost it 

No one can make me cry 
Make me laugh 
Make me smile 
Or drive me mad like she does 
It's like a curse that is the cure 
Better or worse, one thing's for sure 
It's real love and I don't know what I'd do 
If I lost it 

Well the honeymoon ended and life began 
Jobs and bills, losing touch with friends 
And that apartment got smaller every day 
Then one night the walls finally closed in 
I came home late, she said where've ya been 
You used to call and tell me you're on your way 
She said if this is how it's gonna be, then I quit 
She walked out the door 
I lost it 

No one can make me cry 
Make me laugh 
Make me smile 
Or drive me mad like she does 
It's like a curse that is the cure 
Better or worse, one thing's for sure 
It's real love and I don't know what I'd do 
If I lost it 

I picked myself up off the floor 
She walked back through the door 
And we made love like it was the first time 

No one can make me cry 
Make me laugh 
Make me smile 
Or drive me mad like she does 
It's like a curse that is the cure 
Better or worse, one thing's for sure 
It's real love and I don't know what I'd do 
If I lost it 

Oh, if I lost it 
I don't wanna lose it
