Hey

Kiss me (I kiss you)

Kiss me (I kiss you)

I know about you I've been told about you
I've been waiting for you in the air's thin

Tiny holes

And everybody wants to know you
It's wrapped up moon river

Then beyond the blinds and the new white slacks
A light
Sliding into the city
Tunnel beneath the feet of the people in the city

Roamin' roamin' roamin' in the city and

Crossway boy
Crossway boy
Downtownwaterfront boy

In the shadows where the envy and the motor meet and the

She's on the phone again
Surfin'
She's on the phone again

She's calling from america
She's calling from america

She's surfing
She's moshing

And the girls are diving
And the girls are up to something

Animal boything
Upontheroofagain boything

To've been down there
Where there's every kinda lack

Make it down to the delaware and

I'm in your head and

Night

The city loves you
City loves a boyfriend

Love walks with the boyfriend
The city loves a boyfriend

Friends walking with the boyfriend
And the night's with the boyfriend

And the city loves you
Loves you
Loves you

Loves everyone

Everyone is smiling

The smiling is pushing it around
Is pushing it around like the shadows 
In the evolution in the dark

And the

Super boys

Where 
Time is old
When 
Time is everything
When 
Time of all this started

As we turn to earth
Earth wind and fire

Get the sun in your head

Black metal walls are falling

I am the hunger above your town
(a little sound in a little amp)
I am dubious
(I am metal)

I am stainless

I am milk in your plastic

I am wrapped in ribs and left alone
On a full moon
Where the only thing I could do
Lying awake on the floor
At night
The boys who cough

A-cough awake
A-cough awake
Ah ah ah
AH AH AH

Water into you to me
Constantly
Constantly

Without
Without
Without

Without again
Without again

Your telephone numbers move across the water

The ocean between us opens

The silence is indifferent

And love
Love
Love
Love 

Love walks with the boyfriend
The city loves a boyfriend
Friends walking
Friends walking with the boyfriend
The city loves a boyfriend

Everybody loves a boyfriend

You left me alone

You left me alone 

With a full moon
Full moon
Full moon
Full moon

Down on the waterfront
