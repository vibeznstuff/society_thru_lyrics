This time
it's now or never
the ones we are
supposed to bow to

In time we all crawl
believe in believe in me

In time we all fall
through her fingers
Its alright to hide away
underneath the ocean

Open up the way
I have to feel right

In time we all saw
Him open up her

These words won't help you
If you're looking for answers
These words won't help you

It's alright to hide away
Underneath the ocean
Open up the way
I have to feel right
