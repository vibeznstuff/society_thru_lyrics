Out on the floor each night, I'm really movin'
The band's is wailin' right I feel like groovin'
The chicks are out of sight and I am grooving
The crowd is in tonight beggin' for more
I get my kicks out on the floor

I am on the floor tonight, I feel like singin'
The beat is running right and guitars are ringin'
I'm really on tonight and everything swingin'
The room is packed out tight, light at the door
I get my kicks out on the floor

When I'm out on the floor, it makes me feel like a king
Everybody here, don't you know what I mean
It makes me wanna move (makes me wanna move)
It makes me feel that groove (make me feel that groove)
I wanna twist and shout (makes me twist and shout)
Work it on out (make me work it on out)


I am on the floor tonight, I feel like singin'
The beat is running right and guitars are ringin'
The chicks are out of sight and everything swingin'
The room is packed out tight, light at the door
I get my kicks out on the floor
