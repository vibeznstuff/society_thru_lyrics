Show it to me one way, 
I've gotta see it all, 
Scientific Radar, 
Reaching through the storm, 
Theres got to be hope, 
As people move on, 
We've got to keep on believing.


It's time to give it everything, 
A world unite let us in, 
Hear me cry,
Suffocate, 
let them die, 
A better life say goodbye, 
Hear me cry.

I see everything silver &amp; gold, 
Way up im reaching out, 
Clouds white as snow, 
There's gotta be hope, 
As people move on, 
We've gotta keep believing.


Hear me cry, 
Why dont they hear me, 
Suffocate,
Let them die, 
A better life to say goodbye, 
Give, 
Give enough i care.
