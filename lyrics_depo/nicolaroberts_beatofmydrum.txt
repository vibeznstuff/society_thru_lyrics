Once upon a time I pressed rewind
Two left feet, I had no beat
Baby in the corner learning quick
Keep up, keep up, keep up
Graduation take a bow
See how strong you've made me now
Two steppin' all over me, then cha cha cha cha
I'm in!

Oohh don't it make your heart go wow
Oohh how I've turned this whole thing round



L.O.V.E
Dance to the beat of my drum
Dance to the beat of my drum
L.O.V.E
Dance to the beat of my drum
Dance to the beat of my drum

Leader of the pack get on that track
Swing your back and don't look back
Captain attending, too much to handle
Too hot, the pan goes pop
Blow your trumpet like you do

I put on my marchin' boots
I know we can work it out
Let's step into the groove

Oohh don't it make your heart go wow
Oohh how I've turned this whole thing round



L.O.V.E
Dance to the beat of my drum
Dance to the beat of my drum
L.O.V.E
Dance to the beat of my drum
Dance to the beat of my drum





L.O.V.E
Dance to the beat of my drum
Dance to the beat of my drum
L.O.V.E
Dance to the beat of my drum
Dance to the beat of my drum
