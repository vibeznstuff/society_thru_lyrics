Got your tape and it changed my mind
Heard your voice in between the lines
Come around from another time
Where nobody ever goes

All alone on the overpass
Wired and phoned to a heart of glass
Now I'm falling in love too fast
With you or the songs you chose 

And all the stars
Play for me
Say the promise you long to keep

I can hear you sing it to me in my sleep
I can hear you sing it to me in my sleep

I've been living in your cassette
It's the modern equivalent
Singing up to a Capulet
On a balcony in your mind

In the City the lion sleeps
Pray to Sony my soul to keep
Were you ever so bright and sweet
Did you ever look so nice

And all the sounds
Dream for me
Dive me down in a soul so deep 

I can hear you sing it to me in my sleep
I can hear you sing it to me in my sleep
