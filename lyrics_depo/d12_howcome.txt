 So I changed huh? You got a phone, pick it up, call me


How come we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefing now
After all the years we been down
Ain't no way no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family and ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you


So young, so full of life in vibrant side by side wherever you was ridin' I went
So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
When Ronnie died you were right by my side with a shoulder to cry on
Tissue to wipe my eyes, and a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood I did
Sometimes I just want to know why is it that you surcame to yours
And mine I survived it, you ran the streets, I 9 to 5'd it
We grew up, grew apart, as time went by us, then I blew up
To both yours and mine surprises
Now I feel the vibe I just cant describe it
As much as your pride tries to hide it
Your cold, you touch its like ice
In your eyes is the look of resentment
I can sense it, and I don't like it




It was my dream at first to be on spitting a verse
On my own album with a deal but shit got worse
So I came out I would've killed a nigga first
Before I let him disrespect me and check me over some worst
Some bitch that I wasn't with I would hit her then quit
But you would pull a talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved in it, you was smoking the chron with her
Coming out of the bar with her stumbling half drunk
Like you all was husband and wife or something
But me catching her fucking other niggers must've hurt you pride or something
'cause you won't fuck at the mouth with people like you wanted with me
When all I tried to do was show you that your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced
You're acting like I ain't your man and lying like she can't be loose
But I am really you friend, I'm just trying to tell you the truth
But don't hate the game or the player
'cause the one that is changing is you




You're only at the top 'cause my homie had to stop
Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block
Homies in the hood only she be on the tube
Only gossip on the porch get to speaking on who
Fools I used to rap with all expect magic
Like my finger get to snapping and *poof* it just happen
But PROOF is just acting out the party was stoned
Shady made it so my babies ain't starving at home
See the devil in you grin since the ghetto we been friends
Whenever real intelligence that's forever till the end
I be the hatred in your eyes and the Satan in your lives
And wasting my times with these snakes in disguise
(how come) when you talk its with bitter and spite
And (how come) it's my fault for what you did with your life
And everytime I go to hear you and play you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face.
