Say you need more space
What are you, an astronaut?
You've got the whole universe
So what you coming 'round here for?
Said you need more air
Are you underwater now?
We're not even in that deep
Acting like you're gonna drown

We were dancing, late into the day
Half asleep and half awake
When the music starts to fade
We were laying, laying in my bed
For one second, you forget
Oh, here we go again

You say you want a break, so we break up
It's a mistake, so we make up
And then we make out, you freak out
Here we go again
You say we go too fast when you're sober
Then have a glass, you're coming over
And then we make out, you freak out

Don't be such a boy
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
Don't be such a boy
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy

You say you need more me
What, am I a toy again?
You play me like you're all I got
But I ain't hanging by your threads
You say you need love
Mmm, yeah, we all do
And I want to if you let me

But we were dancing, late into the day
Half asleep and half awake
When the music starts to fade
We were laying, laying in my bed
For one second, you forget
Oh, here we go again

You say you wanna break, so we break up
It's a mistake, so we make up
And then we make out, you freak out
Here we go again
Say we go too fast, but you're sober
Then have a glass, you're coming over
And then we make out, you freak out

Don't be such a boy
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
Don't be such a boy
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy

Breathe in, breathe out
We're chilling, so chill out
You're falling to fall out
Don't be such a boy
Breathe in, breathe out
We're chilling, so chill out
You're falling to fall out
Don't be such a boy
