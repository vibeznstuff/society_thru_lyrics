Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Oh, talk to me, can't you see
I'll help you work things out.
Oh, don't wanna be your enemy
And I don't want to scream and shout.

'Cos, baby, I believe in honesty
And then be strong and true.
I shouldn't have to say now, baby,
That I believe in you.

What took you so long?
What took you all night?
What took you forever to see I'm right?
You know, I treat you so good;
I make you feel fine.
You know, I'll never give it up this time.
Oh, no, no.

Oh, you touched my heart right from the start,
You didn't know what to say.
But, honey, I understand
When you take my hand everything's OK.

'Cos, baby, I believe reality,
It's never far away.
I've had enough, so listen, baby,
I've got something to say.

What took you so long?
What took you all night?
What took you forever to see I'm right?
You know, I treat you so good;
I make you feel fine.
You know, I'll never give it up this time.

What took you so long? (What took you so long?)
What took you all night? (What took you all night?)

You know, I treat you so good; (I treat you so good)
I make you feel fine. (I make you feel fine)
You know, I'll never give it up this time.
Oh, no, no.

Baby, I believe in honesty
And then be strong and true.
I shouldn't have to say now, baby,
That I believe in you.

What took you so long?
What took you all night?
What took you forever to see I'm right?
You know, I treat you so good;
I make you feel fine.
You know, I'll never give it up this time.
