Inner city sky rise over town at night,
You pushed me to the top floor so we could see the sights,
I could tell that you wanted to
Jump in the pool,
Jump in the pool,
I looked at you I knew you wanted to
Jump in the pool,
Jump in the pool.

I push off,
I breathe in,
The stillness turning away,
Don't look back,
Don't pretend,
We'll never take control again.
And we're falling beyond the horizon,
And only the water remains
The fear is falling away.

On the poolside staring into glowing blue,
Swimsuit issues with my toes curled in the grooves,
I could tell that you wanted to,
Jump in the pool,
Jump in the pool,
I looked at you I knew you wanted to
Jump in the pool,
Jump in the pool.

I push off,
I breathe in,
The stillness turning away,
Don't look back,
Don't pretend,
We'll never take control again.
And we're falling beyond the horizon,
And only the water remains
The fear is falling away.

Keep breathing,
Keep searching,
Keep holding on.

Keep breathing,
Keep living,
Keep holding on.

I push off,
I breathe in,
The stillness turning away,
Don't look back,
Don't pretend,
We'll never take control again.
And we're falling beyond the horizon,
And only the water remains
The fear is falling away.
