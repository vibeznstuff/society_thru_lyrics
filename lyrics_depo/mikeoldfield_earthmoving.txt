I hear a voice from paradise,
Looks like a new day dawning.
So clear, I just open my eyes.
Can't you hear the voice calling?

I feel a rush in the air tonight,
I can feel the Earth moving.
Love is a beacon, a guiding light.
Can't you feel the Earth moving?


Feel the Earth move,
Now I'm wrapped in a sweet love's arms.
Reaching out for you.
There's something magic in the air tonight,
I can feel the Earth move.

And it moves me.
Can't you hear the voice calling?
Looks like a new day dawning.

Reach out - it's a leap in the dark,
But there's no danger of falling.
Give out, give it straight from the heart.
You feel like thunder rolling.

I feel a rush in the air tonight,
I can feel the Earth moving.
Love is a beacon, a guiding light.
Can't you feel the Earth moving?



And it moves me.
Can't you hear the voice calling?
It feels like thunder rolling.
