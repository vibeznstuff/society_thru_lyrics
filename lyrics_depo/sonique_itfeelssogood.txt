You always make me smile
When I'm feeling down
You give me such a vibe
It's totally bonafide

It's not the way you walk
And it ain't the way you talk
It ain't the job you got
That keeps me satisfied

Your love, it feels so good
And that's what takes me high
Higher than I've been before
Your love, it keeps me alive
Thought I should let you know
That your touch it means so much
When I'm alone at night
It's you I'm always thinking of

Oh, oh, baby

Oh, i want you to understand
How I feel, deep inside
Oh oh, you make me feel
All I need to feel
Yes, in my heart

Your love, it feels so good
And that's what takes me high
Higher than I've been before
Your love, it keeps me alive
Thought I should let you know
That your touch it means so much
When I'm alone at night
It's you I'm always thinking of
