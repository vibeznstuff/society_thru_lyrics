Heaven's in the back seat of my cadillac -
Let me take you there
Yeah yeah.
Heaven's in the back seat of my cadillac -

Yeah yeah.

Can't stand it
Can't stand it
Baby
When I'm close to you I wanna touch you
There are people ev'rywhere
People who like to stare

Can't take it Baby
Let's get outta here.

Let's do it
Let's do it Baby
Let's go for a ride out in the countryside.
Just me and you far from the city lights
That's much too bright for this kinda lovin'.

Makin' love
Makin' love with you
Is such a beautiful thing to do.

Makin' love with you
Is such a wonderful thing with me and moonlight.
