EVERY ROAD THAT I WALK
EVERY SINGLE FLIGHT I EVER TAKE
THOUGH I`M THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY
IN MY MIND EVERY JOURNEY LEADS ME CLOSER TO YOU
I`VE BEEN ALL AROUND THIS WORLD
I`VE BEEN IN FAR TOO MANY STATES
BUT I`M UNDER YOUR SPELL
I`VE MADE MY MISTAKES OH YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL

YOU`RE EVERY DREAM THAT I DREAM
YOU`RE EVERY BEAUTIFUL THING I`VE EVER SEEN
I`M ALWAYS SINGING YOUR PRAISES
COUNTING THE DAYS AWAY

I WOULD BE YOUR SLAVE
I`D EVEN BE YOUR FOOL
I`M SO IN LOVE WITH YOU I`M IN LOVE WITH YOU
I`M GONNA BREAK EVERY RULE

I HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE
EVERY WHITE LIE I`M FORCED TO TELL
THEY SAY THAT EVERYTHING`S FAIR IN LOVE AND IN WAR
AND I`M NOT ABOVE CHEATING FOR YOU
ONE NIGHT I`LL CATCH YOU OFF YOUR GUARD
AND YOU WILL FINALLY FALL SO HARD
STRATEGICALLY SPEAKING I`M ALREADY BEATEN
I`LL SURRENDER TO YOU

YOU`RE EVERY DREAM THAT I DREAM
YOU`RE EVERY BEAUTIFUL THING I`VE EVER SEEN
I`M ALWAYS SINGING YOUR PRAISES
COUNTING THE DAYS AWAY

I WOULD BE YOUR SLAVE
I`D EVEN BE YOUR FOOL
I`M SO IN LOVE WITH YOU I`M IN LOVE WITH YOU
I`M GONNA BREAK EVERY RULE

AND EVERY ROAD THAT I WALK
AND EVERY FLIGHT THAT I EVER TAKE
AND EVERY DREAM THAT I DREAM
EVERY JOURNEY BRINGS ME CLOSER
