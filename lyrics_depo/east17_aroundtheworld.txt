Yeah
Oh
Been around the world
Been around the world
Seen the seas seven sailed across them all
Seen the moon rise over paris and I watched her gently fall
On to the beat
Keep moving never stopping
Though sometimes
I feel like dropping gotta keep on and be strong avoid the wrong
Cos in this life you walk alone
Through the danger zone until you get home
Been around the world but there's no place like home
Oh baby
Been around the world but there's no place like home
Oh baby
Take me home where my soul belongs
Been above the clouds that paint the sky
Stood below the cosmos and I pondered on a way
Back to the track in fact I'm breaking
Through I never knew that you would
Turn and walk away to stay
And leave me standing on my own
Far from meLike a nomad
Sad bad
Dreams about togetherness that we never had
Been around the world but ther's no place like home
Oh baby
(gotta keep on and be strong)
Been around the world but ther's no place like home
(until you get home)
Oh baby
Take me home where my soul belongs
Shout to the north to the south to the east to the west
To the home I love best where my soul can rest
Yes
Been around the world but there's no place like home
Oh baby
(to the home I love best)
Been around the world but there's no place like home
(gotta be strong and keep on)
Oh baby
(where my soul can rest)
Been around the world but there's no place like home
Oh baby
(to the home I love best)
Been around the world but there's no place like home
(gotta be strong and keep on)
Oh baby (where my soul can rest)
Been around the world
Yeah (to the home I love best)
Been around the world
Yeah (to the home I love best)
Been around the world but there's no place like home
(gotta be strong and keep on)
Oh baby (where my soul can rest)
Been around the world but there's no place like home
Oh baby
