You're so young
And you know so much
Heaven help us all
From the tales you tell

You're so old
And innocent as hell
How I love your questions
You Queen of the New Year

Oh you're so young
And you know so much
And my mind's not made up
About the way forward

And now my heart
You know these things
My name for you
Is Queen of the New Year

All the stars in heaven go dim
To the lights on me and him
All the stars in heaven are proud
As the lights on us go out

Now I'm telling you this
In a difficult year
You know your mother
She gave me problems

What am I gonna do
With your honest heart
The champion of love
The Queen of the New Year



All the stars in heaven go dim
All the stars in heaven go dim
All the stars in heaven go dim
All the stars in heaven go dim
All the stars in heaven go dim
To the champion of love
The Queen of the New Year
