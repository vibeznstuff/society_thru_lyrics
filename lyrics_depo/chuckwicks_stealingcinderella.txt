I went to see her dad for a sit down man to man 
Wasn't any secret, I'd be asking for her hand 
I guess that's why he left waiting in the living room by myself 
With at least a dozen pictures of her sitting on a shelf, she was


playing Cinderella 
She was riding her first bike 
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight 
Runnin' through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin 
Dancin with her dad, lookin up at him 
In her eyes I'm prince charming but to him I'm just some fellow
Riding in and stealing Cinderella 

I leaned in towards those pictures 
to get a better look at one
When I heard a voice behind me say
"Now, Ain't she somethin son?"
I said "Yeah, she's quite a woman"
And he just stared at me
And I realized that in his eyes she would always be


playing Cinderella 
She was riding her first bike 
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight 
Runnin' through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin 
Dancin with her dad, lookin up at him 
In her eyes I'm prince charming but to him I'm just some fellow
Riding in and stealing Cinderella 

Oh, he slapped me on the shoulder
Then he called her in the room
When she threw her arms around him
That's when I could see it too


She was playing Cinderella 
She was riding her first bike 
Bouncing on the bed looking for a pillow fight 
Runnin' through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin 
Dancin with her dad, lookin up at him 
If he gives me a hard time
I can't blame the fellow
I'm the one who's stealing - cinderella
