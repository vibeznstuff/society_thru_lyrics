Turn around, open your eyes, look at me now,
Turn around, girl, I've got you, we won't fall down (yeah)
We can see forever from up here, yeah
So long as we're together, have no fear, no fear

So turn around, floating so high above the ground, floating so high,
Turn around, together nothing can stop us now,
Listen, baby,
Turn around, floating so high above the ground, floating so high,
Turn around, together nothing can stop us now,
Turn around,
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Turn around
Oh, oh, oh, oh,


Turn around, outta space we can go there now, yeah, ooh
Turn around, there's no limit to what we've found, ooh, yeah
Music up, I wanna feel it all, yeah
And, baby, we'll stay up,
'Cause there's no way for us to fall, to fall


So turn around, floating so high above the ground, floating so high,
Turn around, together nothing can stop us now,
Listen baby,
Turn around, floating so high above the ground, floating so high,
Turn around, together nothing can stop us now,
Turn around,


Ooh, baby, we're so high now,
Oh, tell our worries and our pain goodbye now
Oh, yeah, yeah


Oh, ay, ay, our home is the sky now,
Oh, yeah, say we're never coming down, down, down


So turn around, floating so high above the ground, floating so high,
Turn around, together nothing can stop us now (baby, nothing can stop us now)
So baby, turn around, floating so high above the ground, floating so high,
Turn around, together nothing can stop us now.
Turn around, ooh, ah,
Turn around, ooh, ah,
Turn around, ooh, ah,
Nothing can stop us now.
