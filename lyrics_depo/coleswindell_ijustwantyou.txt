When I've been gone, when I'm right here
The minute my eyes open in the morning
Out on some highway, or pulling in the driveway
Clear blue sky or when it's thunder storming
My mind just can't escape you
The first time I touched you, that's when I knew

I want you to trust me, I want you to love me
I want you to need me like I'm something you can't lose
I want you to save me, I want you to crave me
Even when I can't find my way to you
If you ever once doubt, anything I'm about
All it ever comes down to, girl I just want you

When you get rattled, or you're coming all unraveled
When you're holding everything together for me
The way you revealed me, the way that you feel me
The way you know I'm holding something inside
Don't know what time has for us
But as long as I'm here, one thing I'm sure of

I want you to trust me, I want you to love me
I want you to need me like I'm something you can't lose
I want you to save me, I want you to crave me
Even when I can't find my way to you
If you ever once doubt, anything I'm about
All it ever comes down to, is girl I just want you
Yeah, I just want you
Yeah, I just want you
