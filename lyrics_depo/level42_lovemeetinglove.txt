Ooh summer nights - making love
together we're as one - in love's light
we have found our way - through another day
so tonight we'll stay
Drunk on loves sweet wine
Heaven yours and mine
Love meeting love sweet lady

Take my soul

And lead me to this place - in the night
hold me in your arms - and take me in
and we'll start again
The flame to the fire - suffering our desire
love meeting love yeah yeah



And floating - lost in love
Your body soft and warm - next to mine
time is standing still - for you and me 
so silently
talking with our eyes - knowing no goodbyes
Love meeting love yeah yeah
