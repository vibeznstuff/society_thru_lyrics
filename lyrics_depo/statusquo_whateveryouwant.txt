Whatever you want
Whatever you like
Whatever you say
You pay your money
You take your choice
Whatever you need
Whatever you use
Whatever you win
Whatever you lose

You're showing off
You're showing out
You look for trouble
Turn around, give me a shout
I take it all
You squeeze me dry
And now today
You couldn't even say goodbye

I could take you home
On the midnight train again
I could make an offer you can't refuse

Whatever you want
Whatever you like
Whatever you say
You pay your money
You take your choice
Whatever you need
Whatever you use
Whatever you win
Whatever you lose

You're showing off
You're showing out
You look for trouble
Turn around, give me a shout
I take it all
You squeeze me dry
And now today
You couldn't even say goodbye

I could take you home
On the midnight train again
I could make an offer you can't refuse

Whatever you want
Whatever you like
Whatever you say
You pay your money
You take your choice
Whatever you need
Whatever you use
Whatever you win
Whatever you lose

Whatever you want
