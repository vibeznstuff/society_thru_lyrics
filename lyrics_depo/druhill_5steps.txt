I don't know how much longer 
You're going to be here 
So I say my prayers 
Every night 
One 4 my mother 
One 4 my father 
And one 4 the love of my life 
So if u decide to leave today 
Then leave tomorrow at the door 
And take only 
Half of yesterday 
Forget all hope for the present 
Cause it just went away 

We were 5 steps 
From eternity 
4 steps 
4 steps past love 
And 3 wishes 
From 
Touching the heavens above 

Another day is gone 
Another night now dawn 
Waiting patiently hoping you'll return 
But not before long 
Why'd you say goodbye 
I still feel your presence 
In my bed at night 
And what was reality once 
A love True in form 
Has now added pain 
For a man scorn 
Forced to wear the memories of pain 
Around an empty heart 
Now I sit in silence and begin to think 
As laughter echoes through the air 
I can't get you off my mind 
But a whole new love 
I could never bare 
So now I lay 
Me down to sleep 
And I pray my Lord my soul to keep 
And if I die, before I wake 
Then I promise I'll be there for you always 

We were 5 steps 
From eternity 
4 steps 
4 steps past love 
And 3 wishes 
From 
Touching the heavens above
