Look up on the wall, there on the floor,
Under the pillow, behind the door.
There's a crack in the mirror.
Somewhere there's a hole in a window-pane.
Do you think I'm to blame?
Tell me do you think I'm to blame?

When they do it you're never there.
When they show it you stop and stare.
Abacab He's in anywhere.

If you're wrapping up the world
'Cos you've taken someone elses girl,
When they turn on the pillow,
Even when they answer the telephone,
Don't you think that by now,
Tell me, don't you think that by now.

When they do it you're never there.
When they show it you stop and stare.
Abacab He's in anywhere.
Abacab Doesn't really care.

you want it, you got it, you gotta go
you want it, you got it, now you know

It's an illusion, It's a game,
Or reflection of someone else's name.
When you wake in the morning,
Wake and find you're covered in cellophane.

Well, there's a hole in there somewhere.
Yeah, there's a hole in there somewhere.
Baby, there's a hole in there somewhere.
Now there's a hole in there somewhere.

When they do it you're never there.
When they show it you stop and stare.
Abacab he's in anywhere.
