The bridge, the call
The ceiling, the floor
The feeling like going to
Take the riot to the wall
The governments can't stand
When the people take a stand
Mind over matter
In their minds, we don't matter man

Cross their borders
Swim their waters
Reject their orders
Love their daughters
Change their ways
Rearrange their days
Gasoline that rag
Burn that fucking flag

Know your rights but you should understand
Who owns who
Systematic breakdown
Know your rights but you should understand
Who owns who
We fuckin' matter


We feel so small
We give our all
The pride, the fall
The soldier standing tall
The government can't stand
When the people take a stand
Mind over matter
In their minds, we don't matter man

Cross their borders
Swim their waters
Reject their orders
Love their daughters
Change their ways
Rearrange their days
Gasoline that rag
Burn that goddamn flag

Know your rights but you should understand
Who owns who
Systematic breakdown
Know your rights but you should understand
Who owns who
We fuckin' matter
