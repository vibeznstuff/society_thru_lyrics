Secrets of lovers
Whisper tonight
Broken down angel
Got lost in the cold daylight
The city is screaming
And I look for your eyes
Someone to lean on through the night
Your music talks to me and hits me tonight
One candle burning, I hear your voice say

So let there be love
Let there be love
Love
Let there be love

It heals and it hurts
She leads you to heaven's door
And leaves you for dirt

Someone to lean on, that's your own
Some magic conquers me and lives in my soul,
She comes like an ocean and I hear you sing
Love will conquer anything

So let it be love
Let it be love
Love
Let it be love

The wall's down
They're coming down
I can't slow
I know it now
So stay now
Hold on
And I'm praying

So let it be love
Let it be love
Love
Let it be love

I know what I want
I know what I feel
I know what I want

So let there be love
So let there be love
Let there be love
