Oh baby it's been so long
I've waited so long
And now that I have you
I want you to come
Come come come into my arms
Oh baby I need you I need you
Come come come into my arms again

Spirits move me
Every time I'm near you
Whirling like a cyclone in my mind
Oh sweet Peter, angel of my lifetime
Answer to all answers I can find

Baby, I love you, come, come,
Come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
Baby, I want you now, now,
Now, and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last?


Oh hold on to me
Don't let go
Come into my life
Don't let go
Oh...

Baby, take me high upon a hillside
High up where the stallion meets the sun
I could love you, build my world around you
Never leave you till my life is done

Baby, I love you, come, come,
Come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
And baby, I want you now, now,
Oh now, oh now,  and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last?
Baby, I want you, come, come
Could this be the magic at last?

Could it be magic?
Come, c'mon, c'mon
Come oh oh come into my arms
Oh, let me know the wonder
Of all of you, all of you
Baby, I want you now, now,
Oh now, oh now and hold on fast
Oh could this be the magic at last?

Come, c'mon, c'mon,
Come oh oh come into my arms
Oh, let me know the wonder of all of you
Baby, I want you now, now, oh now,
Oh now and hold on fast
Oh, could this be the magic at last?
Could it be the magic?
