Yeah
I present to you 
Keisha White, 
Cassidy, 
Listen, 


When I saw you boy I had nowhere to hide 
No matter where I turned 
I found you up down left to right 
Didn't wanna move by, normally I'm so shy 
He's like fire he can light up my sky 
But out of nowhere
We moved to forgive
My sanity's outta here


You the girl of my dreams you mean the world to me 
Ain't no other girl for me I know I treat you terribly 
Plus trust is important in relationships 
I've been taking it for granted you managed to take this shit 
I know I make you sick and you wish I'd treat you better 
They say if you can cheat once then you will cheat forever 
But I don't speak to these freaks, after we sleep together 
It's a bond between us, I'm tryna keep forever...


Ladies holler if you don't (don't) care (care)
who knows 
Ladies holler if you go (go) there (there)
it shows 
Ladies holler if you don't (don't) care (care)
who knows 
Ladies holler if you go (go) there (there) 
it shows 


Show me how you're feeling now 
'Cause you know it takes a bigger person 
(Ohhh)
You got me kinda sprung 
But I was just seeing out your scent
when i saw this, screaming all that,
I really care 'cause I got it like that, 
I won't miss ya 
I'm caught up in your twister 
And I love the way you're spinning me around 


It's nothing like when we cuddle under the sheets together 
We could go to Sr Tropez and lay on the beach together 
I get Gucci from the groupies I'm famous 
You know how to gain give up boo you my main chick 
'Cause you gave me support when I needed that 
I cheated on you plenty of times and you never cheated back 
And that's why I love you to death 
If your love ever left 
My heart will stop pumping blood in my chest 




From the first time 
I really don't mind 
'Cause I'm doing fine 
With you or without 
I see you coming near 
I see you going far 
There's so much to life do you know where you are 
I just wanna thankyou,
For showing me, what's important in life 
'Cause the vibes runnin' through me,
That's what feels so right,



Ladies holler yeah
