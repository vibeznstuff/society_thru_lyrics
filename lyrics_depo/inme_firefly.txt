I went to your bedroom to see you again,
To miss you that much and it's such a long time,
I went to the aisle to marry to your soul,
To miss you that much

Missing you broke my life,
Hoping that you feel the same.
Missing you broke my life.
Missing you broke my life,
Hoping that you feel the same.
Missing you broke my life. 
It's all over now, you've killed me,
It's all over now, you've killed me,
It's all over now, you've killed me,
It's all over now.

Fear is compressed in the back of my stomach,
The rust in my eyes from my corrode halo,
I remember your smile, distorted and pure,
To hold you 'til death.

Missing you broke my life,
Hoping that you feel the same.
Missing you broke my life.
Missing you broke my life,
Hoping that you feel the same.
Missing you broke my life. 
It's all over now, you've killed me,
It's all over now, you've killed me,
It's all over now, you've killed me,
It's all over now.
Missing you broke my life,
Hoping that you feel the same.
Missing you broke my life.
Missing you broke my life,
Hoping that you feel the same.
Missing you broke my life. 
It's all over now, you've killed me,
It's all over now, you've killed me,
It's all over now, you've killed me,
It's all over now
You've killed me (It's all over now),
You've killed me (It's all over now),
You've killed meeee!
