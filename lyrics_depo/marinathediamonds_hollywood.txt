American queen is the American dream
American queen is the American dream

She is a Polish girl in America
Tall, tanned, hot, blond, called Anya
I asked her, "Why would you wanna be a Hollywood wife?"
"Because I don't wanna end up living in a dive on Vine, a dive on Vine."

Air hostesses doing gossip magazine
Crosswords on a flight to JFK
Thirty nine years old
With a mile high sheen
Trying to stimulate a mind
That is slowly starting to decay

I itch my skin, I jump up and say,
"Lady, I know why your thoughts turn gray."


Hollywood infected your brain.
You wanted kissing in the rain, oh, oh, ooh.
Living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams, oh, oh
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America

A fat security making place for me
Soon as I touch down in old L.A.
He said, "Oh, my God, you look just like Shakira!
No, no, you're Catherine Zeta."
"Actually, my name's Marina."

Your mind is just like mine
All filled up with things benign.
You're looking for the golden lie.


Hollywood infected your brain.
You wanted kissing in the rain, oh, oh, ooh.
I've been living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams, oh, oh
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America

American dream is the American queen
American queen is the American dream, is the American dream


Hollywood infected your brain.
You wanted kissing in the rain, oh, oh.
I've been living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams, oh, oh

Hollywood infected your brain.
You wanted kissing in the rain, oh, oh.
I've been living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams, oh, oh.
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America
