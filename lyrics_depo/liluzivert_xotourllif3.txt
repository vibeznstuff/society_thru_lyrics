Are you alright?
I'm alright, I'm quite alright
And my money's right
8, yeah
Countin' them bands all way to the top, 'til they be fallin' over
Countin' them bands on my way to the top, 'til we fallin' over

I don't really care if you cry
On the real you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, "Baby, I am not afraid to die."
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

Phantom that's all red
Inside all white
Like something you ride a sled down
I just want that head
My Brittany got mad
I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I trap now
Stacking my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like "Come on over"
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me
I call it that Casanova
She said I'm insane now
I might blow my brain out
Xanny numb the pain out
Please, Xanny make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted but it keep controlling me
All that pain, now I can't feel it, I swear that it's slowing me, yeah

I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, "I am not afraid to die."
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
All my friends are dead, yeah

That is not your swag I swear you fakin'
Yeah, these niggas wanna take my cadence
Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em
Medicine, little nigga take some
Fast car, Nascar, race 'em
In the club they got no ones, then we were baked now
Clothes from overseas
Got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G, oh
Looking at you stackin' all your money, it all green though
I was counting that and you got twenties, that's a G-roll

She said, "You're the worst, you're the worst."
I cannot die because this my universe

I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, "Baby, I am not afraid to die."
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
