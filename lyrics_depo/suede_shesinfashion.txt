She's the face on the radio
She's the body on the morning show
She's there shaking it out on the scene
She's the colour of a magazine
And she's in fashion
She's in fashion

She's employed where the sun don't set
And she's the shape of a cigarette
And she's the shake of a tambourine
And she's the colour of a magazine
And she's in fashion
And she's in fashion

Oh and if she tells you 2 is 1
Then 2 is 1 my love,
Oh and if she tells you, you should know,
Then you should know my love,

She is strung out on a TV dream
And she's the taste of gasoline
And she's as similar as you can get
To the shape of a cigarette
And she's in fashion
And she's in fashion
