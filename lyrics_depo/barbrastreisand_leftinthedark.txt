Where did she touch you,
How did if feel,
Why did you let it begin
What did she whisper and
What did it mean, and
Where do you think it will end?
How long did it last
Do you think it will stop
Did you get to try anything...new
How good was she - honestly
Where did you go and
Who made the very first move, who made the very first move,
Who made the very first move..
You don't have to sneak in the doorway
Just come on into the room
I've been lying in our bed in the dark all alone
And I've been waiting, I've been waiting for you

There's been no reason to move
It's been as still as a tomb
I needed you oh so badly tonight
But I guess you had better things to do

I should have known that it was coming to this
But I must have been blind
I bet you still got a trace of her love in your eyes
And you've still got her eyes on your mind

You swore you'd be with me at 7 o'clock
Now it's a quarter to 3
And whatever you got and whoever it was
I guess you couldn't get it from me
Whatever you got and whoever it was
I guess you couldn't get it from me

I know that you love me
There's no need to talk
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof
And there are no lies on your body
As I see you undress  ooooh
I just want to get at the truth
I know that you love me
There's no need to talk
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof
And there are no lies on your body
As I watch you undress
I just want to get at the truth

There are so many thing that I've just just gotta know
You tell me who! You tell me where! You tell me when!
But don't tell me now , I don't need any answers tonight
I just need some love so turn out the lights and
I'll be left in the dark again
I'll be left in the dark again
I'll be left in the dark again
Left in the dark again

I should have known that it was coming to this
But I must have been blind
I bet you still got a trace of her love in you  eyes
And you still got her eyes on your mind

You swore you'd be with me at 7 o'clock
Now it's a quarter to 3
And whatever you got and whoever it was
I guess you couldn't get it from me
I guess you couldn't get it from me
But down in my soul, down in my soul
I know-
I know that you love me
There's no need to talk
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof
And there are no lies on your body
As I watch you undress  oooooh
I just want to get at the truth

And there are so many things
That I've just got to know
You tell me who! You tell me where!
You tell me when!  But don't tell me now
I don't need any answers tonight....
I just need some love so turn out the lights and
I'll be left in the dark again

I just need some love
So turn out the lights and I'll be left in the dark again
I just need some love
So turn out the lights and I'll be left in the dark again
I just need some love
So turn out the lights and I'll be left in the dark again
I just need some love
So turn out the light and I'll be left in the dark again
I just need some love
So turn out the lights and I'll be left in the dark again......
Left in the dark again
