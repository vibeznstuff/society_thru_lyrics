(1,2,3,4)
Went out with the guys and before my eyes,
There was this girl she looked so fine.
And she blew my mind,
And I wished that she was mine,
And I said hey wait up 'cause I'm off to speak to her.

And my friends said
(you'll never gonna get her, never gonna get that girl)
But I didn't care
'Cause I loved her long blonde hair
Love was in the air
And she looked at me
And the rest is history

Dude you're being silly 'cause you're never gonna get that girl
And you're never gonna get the girl

We spoke for hours
She took off my trousers
Spent the day laughing in the sun
We had fun
And my friends they all looked stunned (yeah yeah)
Dude she's amazing and I can't believe you got that girl

(My friends said she's amazing and I can't believe you got that girl)
She gave me more street cred
I dug the book she read
How could i forget
She rocks my world
More than any other girl
(Yeah yeah)
Dude she's amazing and I can't believe you got that girl
Can't believe you got the girl.

She looked incredible,
Just turned 17,
I guess my friends were right,
she's out of my league
So what am I to do?
She's to good to be true

But three days later
Went 'round to see her
But she was with another guy
And I said fine
But I never asked her why
And since then loneliness has been a friend of mine

My Friends said
(Such a pity, sorry that you lost that girl)
Sorry you slipped away.
They told me every day,
That it'll be OK.
She rocks my world more than any other girl
Dude it's such a pity, and I'm sorry that you lost that girl
