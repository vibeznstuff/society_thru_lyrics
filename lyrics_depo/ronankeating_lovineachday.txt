'Cause I'm loving each day
As if its the last
Dancing all night
Having a blast
I need you here
Girl I'm on a mission
To cure my condition
'Cause without your kissing
My heart just a prison
I'm hoping and wishing
That girl, I'm forgiven
Say yeah, oh yeah

'Cause every time
You leave me
I'm sad
The moment
You're returning
I'm glad
So let's not go forgetting
What we had
'Cause its bad
So damn bad, yeah


I'm loving each day
As if it's the last
Dancing all night
Having a blast
I want you right
Here next to me
We're loving each day
As if its the last
Dancing all night
Having a laugh
'Cause baby
I need you here

If I hurt your feelings
Then maybe we're even
'Cause I've been bereaving
Since you said
You're leaving
But now you're
By my side
Let's not fight
'Cause you're right

Every time I lose you
I'm lost
No more you
Versus me girl
There is just us
'Cause anything without you
Just a bust, baby
Trust you must thing



So don't go throwing
Our love away
It's here to stay
I'm telling you
There is nothing that
Can stop us anyway,
Yeah
I love devotion,
Let's get in motion
I'm loving each day
As if it's the last
Dancing all night
Having a blast
I want you right
Here next to me
We're loving each day
As if its the last
Dancing all night
Having a laugh
I need you here



I need you here 

Never loving,
Never giving,
Never taking,
Never hoping,
Never dreaming
I need you here
