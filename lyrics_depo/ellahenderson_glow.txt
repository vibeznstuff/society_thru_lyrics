Like a chest of hidden gold
Shimmers in the depths below
We are, we are, the treasures that
They hide
Like the sun that saves the night
Bursting through a darkened sky
We are, we are, soldiers of the light

And we will glow
Oh, oh, oh

So let them build their righteous
Tower
Our blazing hearts will burn it down
We are, we are, soldiers of the light
And we will glow
Oh, oh, oh

We are fire, we are fire
And our love will burn
The flame will never die
We are brighter, we are brighter
Let's show 'em how we light up
Tonight
We will glow
Oh, oh, oh

Like a chest of hidden gold
Shimmers in the depths below
We are, we are, the treasures that
They hide
Like the sun that saves the night
Bursting through a darkened sky
We are, we are, soldiers of the light

And we will glow
Oh, oh, oh

We are fire, we are fire
And our love will burn
The flame will never die
We are brighter, we are brighter
Let's show 'em how we light up
Tonight
We will glow
Oh, oh, oh
We will glow
Oh, oh, oh

We are fire, we shoot our flame up high
They see us burn across a thousand miles
We are brighter, the flame will never die
Let's show 'em how we light up tonight
Oh, you and I we're soldiers of light

We will glow
Oh, oh, oh
We will glow
Oh, oh, oh
We will glow
