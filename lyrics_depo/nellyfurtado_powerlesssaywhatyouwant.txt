Paint my face in your magazines 
Make it look whiter than it seems 
Paint me over with your dreams 
Shove away my ethnicity 
Burn every notion that I may have a flame inside to fight 
And say just what is on my mind 
Without offending your might 

Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you 
But when you feel so powerless what are you gonna do 
So say what you want
Say what you want

I saw her face outside today 
Weatherworn, looking all the rage 
They took her passion and her gaze and made a poster 
Now it’s moccasins we sport 
We take the culture and contort 
Perhaps only to distort what we are hiding 

Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you 
But when you feel so powerless what are you gonna do 
But say what you want
Say what you want

Hey you, the one, the one outside, are you ever gonna get in, get in 
Hey you, the one that don’t fit in, how ya, how ya gonna get in 
Hey you, the one outside, are you ever gonna get in with your 
Broken teeth, broken jaw, broken mojo 
Yeah, this life is too short to live it just for you 
But when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do 

Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you 
But when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do
Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you 
But when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do
Say what you want, say what you want, say, say, say

Cuz this life is too short,
just for you
