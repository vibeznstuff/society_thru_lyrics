Walk right in, walk right in
Walk right in, walk right in
Walk right in, walk right in
Walk right in

Still speedin'

I was telling everybody up your speed
That was a couple of years ago
And now I'm reving up for deliverance
Switching up gears, got a couple of years to go
(Super swah!)
Here we go! as soon as you hear that, go!
Liverpool to portsmouth, yeah,
That chorus got the crowd screaming

Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
I got the people screaming
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
(Still speedin')

Click, click, click, hear the strap
Seat belt Derek's back!
Time to blow like I'm Dynamo
No more disappearing act,
I know you miss me, I miss you too!
Sometimes that's what a mist will do
Like Taio I was cruising
Now it's time to take my steering back
One of the best to ever do it
(They say!)
A testament to this game
(They say!)
And even in the wind I never blew it
(They say!)
I swayed but kept in my lane
They call me Fleetwood Mac
I'm a with a mac with a fleet
Still getting royalties
No spoiler but I spoil me!
I got the crowd screaming

Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
I got the people screaming
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
Still speeding!
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
Make some noise!

Still speedin'

See the way I'm riding
Cameras can flash
Pretty lady by my side
Lewis Hamilton of rap!
(Sway, sway!)
Foot down, moving mammoth on the track
And I don't need no GPS
To see my manor on the map!
Still representing my flag
And I've been all over the world, I've done laps
Senna got the whole crowd raising the roof
I'm Nigel Mansell so better take off hats!
Sticks to the flats, turn the bass up max
People in the rave better raise your hands
Let me hear you make some noise!

Take my love!

They try to give me a ticket
But I ripped it like a raffle
Tell them people I am Mr. Derek Safro
I'm still speeding!
Pedal to the metal on a level I ain't gonna settle
For anything less than gold I ain't gonna meddle around about
And up down and tryna build since I was a little kid but never had the Lego
Running through the fields and the meadows of Ally Pally
And now I'm on a hill, if Geppetto was able to make a fake boy real
I can definitely make a real hard boy as steel!
I ain't gonna stop until I do a couple of millions
I gave them my demo, now it's time to deal again!
I'm back up on the bill again
I'm fresh from the bank,
Bob's your uncle!
Mines uncle Phil again
Because I've got the will power
And the potential
And I got the credentials
All of the essentials
When it gets stressful
My BP rises but I'm never gonna stop
Unless I need to get petrol!
(Swah!)
Still speedin'
