I hit you up, you don't want to write back
Or maybe you don't see me like that
And that's cool baby, I don't wanna fight that
You know me babe, I never been the type that
No I never been the type that
No I never been the type that lies to myself
And I ain't lying to you
So I don't wanna force nothing
See that ain't what I'm trying to do
All I require from you
Is that you stand there
I ain't saying I'm the man, but I am yeah
I'll make it damn clear
I'll be working my magic, there's no shazam here
I see you playing with your hands there
Maybe you should talk to me


I've been smoking too many cigarettes for you
For you
And I know you wanna win
But if you betting to 100
I know that you'll lose, you'll lose


I'm the type of girl that like you
When you do me dirty now
Babe you don't know this life
Let me show you what I'm about
Talk to me now, oho
Talk to me now, oho
Talk to me now
Dirty now
(I'm looking for the ride)
A few more days til I'm Cali Bound
(I love to sing it like)


La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da


I don't see why you never answer my phone calls
You apologize and said you ain't very social
Now I know that's the past and I'm feeling hopeful
Together we could be better than this beat that I vocal
If only you'd let me show you
Now I know that it's cheesyish don't need a genius
To work out whether you're really feeling this
It's another familiar feeling, believe me it's cool
Cause I don't wanna do nothing that's devious
Because you're something to me, never nothing to me
And honestly I don't really know if you're gonna agree
But anything I'm tryin' tell ya what I wanted to see
Whether you gonna be coming with me
But you just gotta talk to me


I've been smoking too many cigarettes for you
For you
And I know you wanna win
But if you betting to 100
I know that you'll lose, you'll lose


I'm the type of girl that like you
When you do me dirty now
Babe you don't know this life
Let me show you what I'm about
Talk to me now, oho
Talk to me now, oho
Talk to me now
Dirty now
(I'm looking for the ride)
A few more days 'til I'm Cali Bound
(I love to sing it like)


Come and take a walk on the right side
You ain't gotta pause I'm a nice guy
So why you're debating it
Come and take a walk on the right side
You ain't gotta pause I'm a nice guy
So why you're debating it


I'm the type of girl that likes you
When you do me dirty now
Babe you don't know this life
Let me show you what I'm about
Talk to me now, oho
Talk to me now, oho
Talk to me now
Dirty now
(I'm looking for the ride)
A few more days and 'til I'm Cali Bound
(I love to sing it like)
