We lay awake silent in the dark 
You don't have to hide the trace 
Emptiness left its mark 

Ring of ice, ring of ice, 'round your heart 
Ring of ice, ring of ice, break apart 

We are lonely people wearin' a ring of ice 
Dancin' in the night tryin' to disguise 
All that lies behind countless empty lies 
Wearing a ring of ice 

I walk alone searchin' for a sign 
Someone else must be alive 
With warmth behind their eyes 

Ring of ice, ring of ice, 'round your heart 
Ring of ice, ring of ice, break apart 

All the lonely people wearin' a ring of ice 
Dancin' in the night tryin' to disguise 
All that lies behind countless empty lies 
Wearing a ring of ice 

All the lonely people wearin' a ring of ice 
Dancin' in the night tryin' to disguise 
All the lies behind surrounded by a ring of ice 
Dancin' in the night tryin' to disguise 
All the lies behind surrounded by a ring of ice 
Dancin' in the night tryin' to disguise 
All the lies behind surrounded by a ring of ice 
Dancin' in the night tryin' to disguise 
All the lies behind surrounded by a ring of ice
