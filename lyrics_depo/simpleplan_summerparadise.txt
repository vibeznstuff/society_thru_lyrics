Oh, Oh
Take me back, take me back
Oh yeah
Back to summer paradise

My heart is sinking
As I'm lifting up
Above the clouds away from you
And I can't believe I'm leaving
Oh I don't kno-kno-know what I'm gonna do

But someday
I will find my way back
To where your name
Is written in the sand

Cause I remember every sunset
I remember every word you said
We were never gonna say goodbye
Singing la-da-da-da-da

Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
Oh-oh
I'll be there in a heartbeat
Oh-oh

(Tell 'em)

My soul is broken
Streets are frozen
I can't stop these feelings melting through

And I'd give away a thousand days, oh
Just to have another one with you

What'd you say

Well real life can wait
(it can wait)
We're crashing like waves
(uh-huh)
We're playing in the sand
(me and you)
Holding your hand

Cause I remember every sunset
I remember every word you said
We were never gonna say goodbye
Singing la-da-da-da-da

Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
Oh-oh
I'll be there in a heartbeat
Oh-oh

Yeah I remember sunny mornings
And summer evenings
Now you're not next to me
And I am freezing
Was it real?
Oh baby, tell me, was I dreaming?
How can you show me paradise,
When I'm leaving?

Now my heartbeat is sinking
Hope's shrinking
When I try to speak no words
Lip-syncing
Hope this is not just wishful thinking
Tell me that you care
And I'll be there in a heartbeat

Someday
I will find my way back
To where your name
Is written in the sand

Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go

Cause I remember every sunset
I remember every word you said
We were never gonna say goodbye
Singing la-da-da-da-da

Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you
And I'll be there in a heartbeat

I remember when we first kissed
How I didn't wanna leave your lips
And how I've never ever felt so high
Singing La-da-da-da-da

Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
Oh-oh
I'll be there in a heartbeat
(summer paradise)
Oh-oh
I'll be there in a heartbeat
