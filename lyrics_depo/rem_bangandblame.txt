If you could see yourself now, baby,
It's not my fault, you used to be so in control.
You're going to roll right over this one.
Just roll me over, let me go,
You're laying blame.
Take this as no, no, no, no, no.

You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
Then blame, blame, blame,
You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
It's not my thing so let it go.

If you could see yourself now, baby,
The tables have turned, the whole world hinges on your swings,
Your secret life of indiscreet discretions.
I'd turn the screw and leave the screen,
Don't point your finger,
You know that's not my thing.

You came to bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
To blame, blame, blame,
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
It's not my thing so let it go now.

You've got a little worry,
I know it all too well.
I've got your number --
But so does every kiss and tell
Who dares to cross your threshold,
Or happens on you way,
Stop laying blame.
You know that's not my thing.

You know that's not my thing, you came to bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
Then blame, blame, blame.
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
It's not my thing so let it go, you
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
Then blame, blame, blame.
It's not my thing so let it go.

You kiss on me, 
Tug on me,
Rub on me, 
Jump on me.
You bang on me, 
Beat on me,
Hit on me,
Let go on me.
You let go on me.
