It feels so beautiful baby, and that's alright
We live on miracles baby, witness tonight
So why don't you touch me? So I?
So I can feel that connection
Don't be afraid of getting high
'Cause up is the only direction

It's time to let em know
Can't hold it in no more
It's burning deep inside and we gotta let it go
They tell us turn it down, we're never growin up
Forever living young and wild
Come on and get it

We ignite the sky (come on and get it)
A billion lights tonight (come on and get it)
Flashing in your eyes (come on and get it)
A spark might start a fire (come on and get it)
A million miles an hour (come on and get it)
And they can't stop the power (come on and get it)

We ignite the sky (come on and get it)
A billion lights tonight (come on and get it)

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Come on and get it
Oh oh oh oh

It's just that freedom we're tasting
No drink, no pills
Don't mind that ruckus we're making
We're living for the thrill
So why don't you hold me? So I?
So I can feel that connection
Don't be afraid of getting high
'Cause up is the only direction

It's time to let em know
Can't hold it in no more
It's burning deep inside and we got to let it go
They tell us turn it down, we're never growing up
Forever living young, the wild
Come on and get it

We ignite the sky (come on and get it)
A billion lights tonight (come on and get it)
Flashing in your eyes (come on and get it)
A spark might start a fire (come on and get it)
A million miles an hour (come on and get it)
And they can't stop the power (come on and get it)

We ignite the sky (come on and get it)
A billion lights tonight (come on and get it)

We ignite the sky (come on and get it)
