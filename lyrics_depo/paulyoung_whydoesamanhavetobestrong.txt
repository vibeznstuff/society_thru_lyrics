There you go again, saying you can’t take any more; 
Here I go again, wishing the ground would swallow me whole. 
If I can’t give you a good reason, then it’s me who must be wrong, 
but I’d cry if I stood for (this) treason so why does a man have to be strong? 
Even though I try to get by oh why, why does a man have to be strong? 
There I go again, finding the words to apologize. 
I’ve got to get these tears I’m crying out of my eyes 
Cause when you tell me that you need me, but you can never find me there 
I bet you think I find it easy or that I don’t even really care 
Is it true what I hear, or just another storyline? 
There’s one thing I know; it won’t be the only time 
You’d think I was made of iron with all the things you put me through 
But girl I tell you I’m not lying when I say that you can hurt me too 
Why is it I have to be strong?
