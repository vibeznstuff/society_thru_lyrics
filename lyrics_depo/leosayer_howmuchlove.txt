How much love do you need
Before you give your love to me
How much time before it grows
How much love I wanna know

What can I do
What can I say
The last thing I want
Is to drive you away
How much love does it take
How much love for heaven sake

How much love, how much love
Do I rush right in or do I hesitate
How much love, how much love
How much love

Am I tryin' too hard
Give me some kind of clue
There must be a way to get through to you
Should I come on strong or do I hesitate
Do I rush right in or do I wait

How much love, how much love
Do I rush right in or do I hesitate
How much love, how much love
How much love

I've got so much love
Don't know where to begin
I'm pleadin' with you babe
You gotta let me in

How much love, how much love
How much love

I've got so much love
Don't know where to begin
I'm pleadin' with you babe
You gotta let me in

How much love do you need
Before you give your love to me
Should I come on strong or do I hesitate
Do I rush right in or should I wait
How much love, how much love
Do I rush right in or do I hesitate
How much love, how much love
How much love
How much love
How much love
