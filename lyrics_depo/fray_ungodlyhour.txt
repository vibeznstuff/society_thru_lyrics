Don't talk, don't say a thing
Cause your eyes they tell me more, than your words
Don't go, don't leave me now
Cause they say the best way out, is through

And I am short on words knowing what's occurred
She begins to leave because of me

Her bag is now much heavier
I wish that I could carry her
But this is our ungodly hour

And I know you're leaving now
Cause I held on to my way tightly
And stay still, until you know
Tomorrow finds the best way out, is through

And I am short on words knowing what's occurred
She begins to leave because of me

Her bag is now much heavier
I wish that I could carry her
But this is our ungodly hour
Ungodly hour
Ungodly hour

And I am short on words knowing what's occurred
She begins to leave because of me

Her bag is now much heavier
I wish that I could carry her
But this is our ungodly hour
Ungodly hour
Ungodly hour

Her bag is now much heavier
I wish that I could carry her
But this is our ungodly hour
