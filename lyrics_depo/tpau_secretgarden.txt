There's more than a feeling than a differing mind to anatomy

On my own who's going to hold me?
A burning heart lifts me up to my life

I can't run from the truth and I won't try.
'Cause it wouldn't matter who you were in this world

There's nothing on earth that we can't change
But on the inside I could never be the same.
Came into the garden
Babe
Oh
You got to come on in

Come into the secret garden.
We're changing the way we're made

And in our own eyes
We're going to move the mountain.

So how do you see me now? Can you see me?
Don't butter me up and tell me lies

I've seen the black and white coloured in your eyes.
But trapped in a cage is not the place

You can leave me or cover it up to ease your mind.
In this confusion I can always see the light into the garden.

Come into the garden
babe
Oh
Come on in
...

You'll never know it feels not to be one thing or the other.
If there was a world without hypocrisy

You never know I might just be something you need.

It wouldn't matter who you were in this world

Knowing yourself is so much more

Take one step forward and you open up the door.

Come into the garden
babe
Oh
Come on in
...
Come into the garden
babe
Oh
Come on in
...
Come into the garden
babe
Oh
Come on in
...
