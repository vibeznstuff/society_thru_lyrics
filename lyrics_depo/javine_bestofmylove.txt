Yay...
Wooah-oah....
Uhuh...

(I thought) this is the real thing.
(I thought) you're gonna feel me.
(I thought) I hope it ain't too good to be true.
(It felt) like nothing before.
(You were) what I was waiting for.
At least that's what I made myself believe...


Coz I was there for you.
Baby, what did I do,
To make you untrue?


You said I satisfied all your fantasies.
You said I was everything you ever dreamed.
So how come suddenly it ain't enough,
That I gave you the best of my love?

What you saw was what you got.
First you loved, then you loved me not.
Turns out, baby, you're just all about the chase.
You just want what you don't have.
Now I've gone but it's too bad.
I won't be making that mistake again.

You said I satisfied all your fantasies.
You said I was everything you ever dreamed.
So how come suddenly it ain't enough,
That I gave you the best of my love?
You said you wanted to take it all the way.
When it came down to it you were never gonna stay.
So I'm done with that, I've have enough.
I'm taking back the best of my love. (the best of my love)

I'm done with it and I'm over it and I'm through with it.
And I can't believe I ever was a fool for you.
But I'm out the door, I don't want no more...oooh.
I'm done with it and I'm over it and I'm through with it.
And I can't believe I ever was a fool for you.
But I'm out the door, I don't want no more now you're on your own!
