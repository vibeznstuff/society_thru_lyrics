All my love, came to nothing and oh! my love
When I woke up to find,you were no longer mine.

All my love, thrown away after all this time
Now there's no place for me,in the future you see.

I don't understand you,
I've done all I can do
tell me how could I give you more,more than...

All my love, came to nothing and oh! my love
When I woke up to find,you were no longer mine.

All my love, came to nothing and oh! my love
When I woke up to find,you were no longer mine.
