I loved you 

Just another day
Of not being in your way 
So I'm all alone
All alone, ooh yeah
Just another week 
We don't hardly speak
But I'm holding on
Stop treating me so wrong

Give me your loving
Give me your mind
Give me your kissing
Give me some time
'Cos I can't live a lie
If my heart walks out your life
Give me your loving
Give me some easing
Give me your kissing
Give me a reason
To make me want to stay 
Wanna go back to the day I loved you

I loved you more
When you had no money 
More
Used to say I loved you more
Baby all I need is
More time and more mind
I loved you more 
Every day was sunny
More
Used to think about you more
Baby all I need is 
More time and more mind

Don't make me twist your arm to stay 
A little me will be OK
Walk out the door
Oooh woahh
I think it's time I found that guy 
You can rely on day and night
To be by my side baby 
And be a real man to his lady

Give me your loving
Give me your mind
Give me your kissing
Give me some time
'Cos I can't live a lie
If my heart walks out your life
Give me your loving
Give me some easing
Give me your kissing
Give me a reason
To make me want to stay 
Wanna go back to the day I loved you

More
When you had no money 
More
Used to say I loved you more
Baby all I need is
More time and more mind
I loved you more 
Every day was sunny
More
Used to think about you more
Baby all I need is 
More time and more mind

I could walk away, turn my back
But I can't do that
Oh no, I can't do that
I love you more than just what's in the bank
And that's a fact
And that's a fact

Let it go
When you're at home
Give me your heart
Give me your soul
Not like you used to be
You used to make me happy
Give it up
Give me your trust
Give me your passion
Give me your love
To make me want to stay
I want to go back to the day I loved you
