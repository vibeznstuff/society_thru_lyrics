Shut up you talk too loud
You don't fit in with the crowd
I can't believe you exist
I crossed you right off my list
Too much too soon
Way out of tune


No class 
Ah baby no class
No class
No class

Way out you're way out of line
No buddy I can't spare a dime
Fade out baby that's right
No bark and even less bite
Your perfect smile
Betrays your lack of style



Too late ya can't catch up now
You face the wrong way anyhow
I know you ain't got the brain
To come in out of the rain
Too bad no magic
I'm afraid you're merely tragic
