I'm a lay-by lover and you're just another
Who just wants to hit and run
Now you're on your own 'cos I'm accident prone
And I hope that you have your fun

They say the devil loves his own and lady you just got to roll
He drives your modus-operandi, well lady you don't get this soul
What you call love I can't take no more
Go knock on someone else's door

I'm a lay-by lover and you're just another
Who just wants to hit and run
Now you're on your own 'cos I'm accident prone
And I hope that you have your fun
'Cos you specialise in your own kind of lies
Baby, you just hit and run
I just wanna say you keep driving that way
And one day you will be undone

I tried to love you my way but lady you just wouldn't slow down
You drove right on through me when other guys came around
What you call love wouldn't give to a stray
I wouldn't treat a dog that way

I'm a lay-by lover and you're just another
Who just wants to hit and run
Now you're on your own 'cos I'm accident prone
And I hope that you have your fun
'Cos you specialize in your own kind of lies
Baby you just hit and run
I just wanna say you keep driving that way
And one day you will be undone

One day you'll have to slow down and lady it could be too late
You keep on accelerating and lady I can see your fate
No one wants a second-hand car
They know it's been pushed too far

I'm a lay-by lover and you're just another
Who just wants to hit and run
Now you're on your own 'cos I'm accident prone
And I hope that you have your fun
'Cos you specialize in your own kind of lies
Baby you just hit and run
You're dragging me down with this riding around
And one day you will be undone

I'm a lay-by lover and you're just another
Who just wants to hit and run
Now you're on your own 'cos I'm accident prone
And I hope that you have your fun
