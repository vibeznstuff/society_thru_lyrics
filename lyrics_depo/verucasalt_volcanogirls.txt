Leave me, lying here.
Cause I don't wanna go. 
Tell me, tell me
what you really want from me.
You gotta let me know.
I'm falling off and
I need you terribly.
One down and one to go.
Volcano Girls,
we really can't be beat.
Warm us up and watch us blow.
But now and then we fail 
and we admit defeat.
We're falling off,
we are watered down and fully grown.
Leave me, lying here.
Cause I don't wanna go. 
A million miles of running and 
I hit the wall,
I bounce back and I run some more.
But this is it, I'm giving up,
I'm calling quits.
So get down and meet me on the floor.
Way to go, way to flip off everyone.
I steal your thunder then I try to bolt.
But I could stand a little pity now and then.
I'm falling off, 
I am watered down and fully grown.
I told you about the Seether before.
You know the one that's neither or nor.
Well here's another clue if you please,
the Seether's Louise.
Leave me, lying here.
Cause I don't wanna go. 
Leave me, leave me, leave me.Go..
I don't wanna go
