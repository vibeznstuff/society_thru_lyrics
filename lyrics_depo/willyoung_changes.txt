Gotta shake myself 
Up here 
I should run away 
Run away, run away 
People say 
Don't even go near 
I can see the danger 
I'm aware 
I see the danger 

If I go back once again 
It's like 
I learned nothing 
Standing at the front 
Of a queue 
Heading for trouble 

Hope it changes 
Hope my life changes 
Gets alright somehow 
Oh 
I'm waiting for tomorrow 
I hope it changes 
Can't you stay the same 
Been out of luck 
For so long 
And I don't get much 
So there's nothing 
Much to lose 

It's like a record 
Going round 
Yes, it's going round 
Going round, going round 
I know I should wanna 
Take it off 
But I find it hard 
Why do I find it hard? 

I used to have a vision 
I was sitting 
Somewhere up there 
Looking down on myself 
Doing right 
For once in my life 
It changes 
Hope my life changes 
Gets alright somehow 
Oh 
I'm waiting for tomorrow 
I hope it changes 
Can't you stay the same 
Been out of luck 
For so long 
And I don't get much 
So there's nothing 
Much to lose 

I just need a break 
A little one 
To get me up 
To watch the sun 
And hey 
It's peaceful here 

Hope it changes 
Hope my life changes 
Gets alright somehow 
Oh 
I'm waiting for tomorrow 
Hope it changes 
Can't you stay the same 
(Can't you stay the same) 
Been out of luck 
For so long 
(Can't you stay the same) 
Don't get much 
So there's nothing 
Much to lose 
Changes 
Oh 
I'm waiting for tomorrow 
Hope it changes 
Can't you stay the same 
Been out of luck 
For so long
