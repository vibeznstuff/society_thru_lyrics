Come on over
Break some bread
Close the window
and we'll lay on the bed
If you're the future
then I'm with you
Looking forward
to everything that we do
They are stupid
they don't know
Going nowhere
but we're ready to go
We're together
on our way
Are you ready
for what I'm going to say
Ohhhh...


Yeah, I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
and I know that it's you


Yeah....
