I love you my hard englishman
Your rage is like a fist in my womb
Can't you forgive what you think I've done
And love me - I'm your woman
And I desire you my hard englishman
And there is no more natural thing
So why should I not get loving
Don't be cold englishman
How come you've never said you love me
In all the time you've known me
How come you never say you're sorry
And I do
Ah, please talk to me englishman
What good will shutting me out get done
Meanwhile crazies are killing our sons
Oh listen - englishman
I've honoured you - hard englishman
Now I am calling your heart to my own
Oh let glorious love be done
Be truthful - englishman
How come you've never said you love me
In all the time you've known me
How come you never say you're sorry
And I do
I do
