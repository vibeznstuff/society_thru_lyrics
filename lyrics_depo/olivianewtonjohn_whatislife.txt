What I feel I can't say
But my love is there for you any time of day
But if it's not love that you need
Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed

And tell me what is my life without your love?
And tell me who am I without you by my side?

What I know I can do
If I give my love to everyone like you
But if it's not love that you need
Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed

And tell me what is my life without your love?
And tell me who am I without you by my side?

What I feel I can't say
But my love is there for you any old time of day
But if it's not love that you need
Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed

And tell me what is my life without your love?
And tell me who am I without you by my side?
And tell me what is my life without your love?
And tell me who am I without you by my side?
And tell me what is my life without your love?
And tell me who am I without you by my side?
