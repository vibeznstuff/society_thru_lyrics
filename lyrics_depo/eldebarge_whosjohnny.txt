There she goes and knows I'm dying
When she says, "Who is Johnny? "
Games with names that girl is playing
All she says is "Who is Johnny? "

I try to understand because I'm people too
And playing games is part of human nature
My heart's in overdrive
It's great to be alive


"Who's Johnny? " she said
And smiled in her special way
"Johnny" she said
"You know I love you"
"Who's Johnny? " she said
And tried to look the other way
Her eyes gave her away

She makes sure I see her teasing
Hear her say "Who is Johnny? "
There's no way to take this easy
Hear her say "Who is Johnny? "

I really couldn't help but fall in love with her
Her being there
Has made my life worth living
I knew it from the start
That I would lose my heart



Still pretending
Who's Johnny Who's Johnny
Who's Johnny Who's Johnny
"Who's Johnny? " she said
And tried to look the other way
Her eyes gave her away

Girls like her are very special
Girls like her don't rest
'Till you too are a believer
'Till you too have caught their fever

There she goes and knows I'm dying
When she says "Who is Johnny? "
