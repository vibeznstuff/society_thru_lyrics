I know you didn’t realize
That the city was gone
You thought there would be advertisements
To give you something to go on

So we search the sky
For any flashing signs
We’ve gone too far beyond
The border it’s just you and I
And if this is the end
It’s the best place I’ve ever been
It feels so good to just
Get lost sometimes

Only the horses
Can find us tonight
Only the horses
Can bring us back home
Our tracks they will follow
They’ll hear us calling
And save us by morning light
Only the horses
Can bring us back home
Tonight
Tonight

We can’t escape the basic facts
How cold it can get
There’s nothing to protect ourselves
When the rain gets us wet

So I’ll just tell you now
This is our final bow
If you don’t know the way to
Hold me let me show you how
And if this is the end
It’s the best place I’ve ever been
It feels so good to just
Get lost sometimes

Only the horses
Can find us tonight
Only the horses
Can bring us back home
Our tracks they will follow
They’ll hear us calling
And save us by morning light
Only the horses
Can bring us back home
Tonight
Tonight

Only the horses
Can find us tonight
Only the horses
Can bring us back home
Our tracks they will follow
They’ll hear us calling
And save us by morning light
Only the horses
Can bring us back home
Tonight
