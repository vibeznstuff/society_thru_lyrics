Love-love-love-love-GIRL!)

If I love ya love me right back (girl!)
The kind of love that keep you comin' back (girl!)
If I love ya love me right back (girl!)
Don't ever leave me, girl, don't do me that
So please (stay!), don't walk (away!)
Gimme another chance, mi love you the right (way!)
My true feelings pushing on
Woman, you luv me, can't do without

Who am I without you by my side?
Every little piece of my heart broken in the dark
Wishin' I could hold you now
When you were here for me
I was not there for you
I was too blind
Couldn't see what you did for me
Now I don't know what to do

Ladi ladi ram tam, ladi ladi ram tam
I'll be right here for you
Ladi ladi ram tam, ladi ladi ram tam
I'll be calling out for you, can you hear me?
