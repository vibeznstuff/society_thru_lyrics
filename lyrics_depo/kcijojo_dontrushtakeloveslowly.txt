The look within you eyes, baby 
it makes me wonder why, lady 
you want to get with me, darlin 
when i thought we were just friends 
then you made your move on me 
you started moving on me strongly 
even though nobody was around, 
I still had to tell you to slow it down 
we don't have to rush the night away 
there's always going to be another day 
a time to make love an da time to play 
what i'm trying to say, take love slowly 
when i took you to my house baby you got buck wild 
and kicked off your shoes 
then youstarted dancing 
i said come over here have a littl eseat with me 
all i wanna do is watch a little bit of tv 
she started rubbin' on my legs 
fingers in my hair 
then you got silly 
said let's play truth or dare 
i'm not in the mood 
honey i swear 
baby you're otta control 
i had to get up out of there 
we don't have to rush the night away 
there's always going to be another day 
a time to make love and a time to play 
what i'm trying to say, take love slowly 
don't rush it 
don't rush (don't) 
don't rush it 
don't rush (don't ) 
don't rush it 
don't rush (don't) 
don't rush it 
don't rush (don't) 
don't rush it 
don't rush (don't) 
don't rush it baby 
we don't have to rush the night away 
there's always going to be another day 
a time to make love and a time to play 
what i'm trying to say, take love slowly
