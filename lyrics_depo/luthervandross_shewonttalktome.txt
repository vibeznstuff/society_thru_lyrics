I was hanging with some friends of mine
We were all having a real good time, yeah
I saw a girl who was so very fine
I started waving my hands, my arms, my head

Got the nerve; found the words to say
But to my surprise she was passing
I mean it was strange 'cause she just walked away
She won't talk to me, she won't talk to me

Now you're nervous with the fever
Body beat and never quit
I'm in heaven when I see her
Won't you talk some little things?
Hope she talk to me

I can't hear (What cha gonna do?)
You can't sit down like no one all by yourself
(I just wanna talk to you) And nobody else, yeah

I just wanna tell her
She's the girl of my fantasies
How we meet in my dreams every night it seems
And how love can be, I wanna (love you)
I'm gonna be (your love)

It's not everyday we see the one
That your heart's been likely dreaming of
There's that look in her eyes, so I don't know why
She won't talk to me, she won't talk to me

She pretends she doesn't see me
Leaves me standing in the rain
'Cause I know she wants to meet me
She's just playing silly games

I said girl (What cha gonna do?)
Wanna show you a love that you just gotta see
(I just wanna talk to you) But she won't talk to me

And ooh, I'm telling everyone
I'm not dreaming anymore
'Cause I know she won't talk to me now
And at least she can't say no

And I'm going crazy
Trying to make her notice me
I go up, I get down, I turn all around
She won't talk to me, she won't talk to me

I said (Hey there baby)
I said (Hey there girl)
I said (Hey there baby)
She won't talk to me
She won't talk to me
