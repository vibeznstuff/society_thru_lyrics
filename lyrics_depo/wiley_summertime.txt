Yo, for the 29th year in my life it's summer again
Summer 2'8
Eski Boy, yo
Eski Boy
Summertime breeze
Summertime jumps
GO!

Summertime's life
The weather's got me on a summertime vibe
It's like green summer days summer nights
And yeh they are treating me right,
I look left and right
High street comes to life
Couple of honeys and they're looking alright
I fast approach em
Let em know that it's nice to know them
And of course I got an internt modem
Myspace, facebook take a look,
Leave a comment on my page, got new beats to show you

New life new team now rolling
Chris believes in the part where I'm strolling
I scream round on a 12 hour shift
I bet when he reaches home, it's paper that he's folding
And my flow's golden
So in the part can't you see I was chosen
Ooooh! Go!

(It's My Time)

It's my time
And I'm ready to go, put on my shoes and get on with the show
Let's go!
It's my time
And I'm ready to go. put on my shoes and get on with the show

Summertime ladies, babies father gone A.W.O.L
Might see baby grow with summertime babies
See my name in the Summertime Daily
I used to be on the summertime crazy
Now I let my chill dance till my summertimes leaves me
Even then I know summertime reads me
Was a holiday now summertime plays me

(It's My Time)

It's my time
And I'm ready to go, put on my shoes and get on with the show
Let's go!
It's my time
And I'm ready to go. put on my shoes and get on with the show

Don't you just love life in the summertime
Got dress sense and the summertime knows
I got a summertime pose
There he goes new summertime pose
Got the crowd going mad at the summertime shows
Y'all checkin out my summertime flows
Some don't know what the summertime holds
Got two power backs and a summertime roll
I know...
It's summertime fever, working hard getting summertime beavers
Market day the fruit on the tree's so ripe
Except one she looks like the leader
Step back took a look tryna read her
And she also has got summertime fever
Made a room got through she was looking too good
So good that's why I couldn't leave her

(It's My Time)

It's my time
And I'm ready to go, put on my shoes and get on with the show
Let's go!
It's my time
And I'm ready to go. put on my shoes and get on with the show
It's My Time
And I'm ready to go, put on my shoes and get on with the show
Let's go!
It's my time
And I'm ready to go. put on my shoes and get on with the show
