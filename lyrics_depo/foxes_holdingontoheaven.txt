Starless sky,
We've got so good at pretending
There's a side, a side to you, that isn't running
And I don't know where it is that you've been hiding
But I need you tonight
But I need you tonight

Cos' I'm holding onto heaven
Lights fade but I won't let them
Oh I'm holding onto heaven
When I breathe it's only you

All these years
I've been chasing down the answers
I was here, always tracing out your shadows
But I need you tonight

Cos' I'm holding onto heaven
Lights fade but I won't let them
Oh I'm holding onto heaven
When I breathe it's only you

I can't take it
Cos you think nobody sees what you're doing to me
I'm telling you guilt is in your eyes
I hate what you've done, what you've made me become
No sleep, face the night

Oh I'm holding on
Lights fade but I won't let them
Cos' I'm holding onto heaven
When I breathe it's only you

Cos' I'm holding
I'm holding onto heaven
