Something happened babe
Only you can make it right
And clear my heavy mind with your tricks
Got that magic baby
Coz everything I feared
Just slowly disappears as we kiss


Baby I want you close, I want you close, give me your love
Baby I want some more, I want some more, can't get enough
Baby wanna feel your touch, wanna feel your touch, just give it up
We can go on and on, on and on


Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't leave me girl
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-h
Please stay with me tonight
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't leave me girl
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I know you're down to give it up


Are you happy babe?
I can make it Valentine's
Every single night, dim the lights, yeah
I'm ecstatic babe
You got me on a high
Join me in the sky paradise, yeah, yeah


Baby I want you close, I want you close, give me your love
Baby I want some more, I want some more, can't get enough
Baby wanna feel your touch, wanna feel your touch, just give it up
We can go on and on, on and on


Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
 Don't leave me girl
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Please stay with me tonight
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't leave me girl
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah)
I know you're down to give it up


Had a show in Sydney in front of Aussies right?
Then a show London on the longest flight
I know it's been too long and you're always right
I'm just tryna see you after a hard day's night
Listen it's between us, our secret, don't tell
It's Beatles Mania when I leave the hotel
We don't want tabloids, cats have no chill
Just tryna be with you alone we could go 'til
The clock hits morning, it's a sure thing
Let's tuck off without paparazzi swarming
I'm tryna show you you're the most important
In town one night, ain't tryna be too forward
But we got one chance and I can't wait 'til
The next time I see you, so you should stay 'til
I leave to the next city and disappear
So don't leave I need you here
I'm saying...


Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't leave me girl (Eazy)
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Please stay with me tonight
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't leave me girl
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I know you're down to give it up


Don't leave, hey
Please stay with me tonight
Don't leave me baby
Oh, you know you got to give it up
Haha
