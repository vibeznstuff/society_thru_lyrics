You're a big girl now
With a big girl's needs
And a big girl's dreams and promises.
Why don't you accept yourself,
Accept your desires
And meet your needs,
Deny your problems?
And don't cry, cry, don't cry,
Oh, you're a big girl now.
It's so hard to be humble
When you know you're worth more
To live and learn
Is all we can hope for.
And attraction of pasts
Like the blindness of the summer sun
Oh, but what will you do,
Oh, when the rain comes through.
If it's to be then don't
Cry, cry, don't cry,
And don't cry, cry, don't cry.
Why don't you accept yourself,
Oh, accept your desires
And meet your needs,
Deny your problems?
If it's to be then don't
Cry, cry, don't cry,
Oh, you're a big girl now.
And don't cry, cry, don't cry,
Oh, you're a big girl now.
Don't cry.
