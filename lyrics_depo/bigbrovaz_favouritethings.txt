What I need is a gentleman
Who does the best he can
There to hold my hand

Cos a girl gotta have her favourite things

Nice type of life

I would like a man who
Takes care of business
And still have the time to take me on a shopping spree
What's mine is yours and what's yours is mine
With what we have let's put it together and we can shine

I know what you want and 
I got what you need
I believe you should be rolling with me
I take your around out on the town
And show you the way that a baller gets down
Whenever you're ready girl, we can go now
And we can do things you don't even know how
I know that you know that I'm feeling your style
So tell me what to do just to make you go wild

Let me tell you about D, its all about 
Simplicity, easy to please
But I like expensive things
For me you can buy diamonds and pearls
Just some of the little things 
I like in my world

So you like wining and dining and shining
Gliding and riding
Pushing them hot whips
Mummy come get with a real pimp
Its flossing Flawless honest
I'll make you a shopoholic
Buying you stuff until you vomit
Blowing chronic, hopping on it
Even if you didn't want it
