I know you like to wear my dressing-gown, 
When i'm not there. 
I guess you like it in my shoes. 

Just coz you drive a Mazarati 
And the ladies stare 
Don't mean you'll go as fast as i do. 

I know it's summer in the city 
And the sun is high 
But you can play it cool again 
Coz boy i seen you disco dancing 
With your pants on fire 
We need a little tropical rain 

So baby, baby 
Watch the needle when your heading south 
You drive me crazy 
Just remember you can burn me out 
So get down... 

It's been a long, hot summer 
And it's 95 degrees in the shade 
It's only Sunday morning 
And I need that Friday feeling again 

You put me in a fever 50 stories high 
And suddenly i'm freezing 
And i don't know why 
It's been a long, hot summer 
And i'm shaking like a cool lemonade 

If you wanna get fresh 
Get outta my car 
Coz the boys up due we're going to fast 
I'm taking my time now 

If you wanna fly high 
Keep outta the sun 
When your fingers start to burn 
It's no fun 
So why don't you climb now 

If you wanna get fresh 
Then take a cold shower 
Put your back on ice 
Before you turn sour 
Nobody can fool me 

Now i'm cleaning my head 
And dusting my eyes 
Every time i feel the temperature rise 
I need you to cool me 

I'm partied out of house and home 
So baby if you fight me 
How you gonna like me 

Runnin down that Old Kent Road 
So think before you bite me 
How you gonna get back home 

It's been a long, hot summer 
And it's 95 degrees in the shade 
It's only Sunday morning 
And i need that Friday feeling again 

You put me in a fever 50 stories high 
And suddenly i'm freezing 
And i don't know why 
Its's been a long, hot summer 
And i'm shaking like a cool lemonade 

Coz I 
So why do you bite me 

A little late to take it slow 
But i couldn't wait to party 

At the cannon ball 
Not what i wanted 
Now i've seen it all 
So find me 

I've ricoched 
Around the world 
Drinking pink champagne 
It's Easy!
