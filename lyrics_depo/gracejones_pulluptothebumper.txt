Driving down those city streets
Waiting to get down
Won't you take your big machine 
Somewhere in this town
Now in the parking lot garage 
I found the proper place
Just follow all the written rules
You'll fit into the space

Pull up to my bumper baby
In your long black limousine
Pull up to my bumper baby
And drive it in between

Pull up, to it, 
Don't drive, through it
Back it, up twice
Now that fits nice

Operate around the clock,
Slow it if you come in?
I've got lots of space for everyone
One for you my friend?
My lines are short I'll fix you up
So won't you please come on,
Shiny sleek machine you wheeled
I've got to blow your horn.

Pull up to my bumper baby
In your long black limousine,
Pull up to my bumper baby
And drive it in between.

Pull up to it, don't drive through it,
Back it, up twice, now that fits nice,
Grease it, spray it
Let me lubricate it

Pull up to my bumper baby
