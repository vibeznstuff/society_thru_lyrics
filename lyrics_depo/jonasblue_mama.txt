Where should we run to?
We got the world in our hands and we're ready to play
They say we're wasted
But how can we waste it if we're loving every day?
Okay, I got the keys to the universe
So stay with me 'cause I got the keys, babe

Don't wanna wake up one day wishing that we'd done more
I wanna live fast and never look back, it's what we're here for
Don't wanna wake up one day wondering where'd it all go
'Cause we'll be home before we know, I wanna hear you singing

Hey, mama, don't stress your mind
We ain't coming home tonight
Hey, ma, we're gonna be alright
Dry those eyes
We'll be back in the morning when the sun starts to rise
So mama, don't stress your mind
So mama, don't stress your mind

Mama, mama, mama, yeah
We ain't coming home tonight
Mama, mama, mama, yeah
We ain't coming home tonight

Where should we run to?
We got a ticket that takes us wherever we like
We got our problems
But just for the minute, let's push all our troubles aside
Alright 'cause we got the keys to universe
Inside our minds, yeah, we got the keys, babe

Don't wanna wake up one day wishing that we'd done more
I wanna live fast and never look back, it's what we're here for
Don't wanna wake up one day wondering where'd it all go
'Cause we'll be home before we know, I wanna hear you singing

Hey, mama, don't stress your mind
We ain't coming home tonight
Hey, ma, we're gonna be alright
Dry those eyes
We'll be back in the morning when the sun starts to rise
So mama, don't stress your mind
So mama, don't stress your mind

Hey, mama, don't stress your mind
We ain't coming home tonight
Hey, ma, we're gonna be alright
Dry those eyes
We'll be back in the morning when the sun starts to rise
So mama, don't stress your mind
So mama, don't stress your mind

Mama, mama, mama, yeah
We ain't coming home tonight
Mama, mama, mama, yeah
We ain't coming home tonight
