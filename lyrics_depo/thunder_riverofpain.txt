I should've seen it coming now 
Should've known it would happen this way 
If I'd trusted my initial instincts 
Then maybe you'd be here today 

Cos the more that I gave 
The more I could see a change 
You only wanted my love 
When you thought I might take it away, I'm afraid 

Now I'm drowning in a river of pain 
Slowly going down 
All I did was love you too much 
So now I'll remain 
Stranded here forever 
Drowning in a river of pain 

I don't know when it happened now 
Suddenly you'd taken control 
One day I was pulling your strings girl 
Then the next you had a grip on my soul 

So I let myself go baby
Cos my heart wouldn't be denied 
There was distance in your eyes 
And your touch turned fire to ice, no surprise 

That I'm drowning in a river of pain 
Here with my regrets 
Going round and round in my head 
But still I remain 
Stranded here forever 
Drowning in a river of pain 

Somehow when you saw the other side of me 
Then I lost my mystery 

Now I'm drowning in a river of pain 
Slowly going down 
All I did was love you too much 
So now I'll remain 
Drowning in a river
Oh I'm drowning
