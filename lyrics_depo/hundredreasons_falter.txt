In my hands, good fortune
Caress my equal with slightest touch
The sound of your voice keeps me still
And i'm sorry i avoid your questions

I'd never falter now that we're even
Explain why you will
Take while you can it's never even
While we lay still
I'd never falter now that we're even
Explain why you will
Take while you can it's never even
While we lay still

A place to run, it's colder
And peace of mind takes its own time for us
And in the same breath we argue
And it MUST be a sign of closeness i guess

I'd never falter now that we're even
Explain why you will
Take while you can it's never even
While we lay still
I'd never falter now that we're even
Explain why you will
Take while you can it's never even
While we lay still
