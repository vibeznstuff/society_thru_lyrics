It's whereabouts that won't cave in 
Scenes of violence protect this 
In aching heart that will begin 
To wrestle with obstruction 

And I'd stay for ages, if i could 
To wake you 
I'd stay for ages, If I could 
To wake you 

In taking hold to waste within 
Coping as best as you can with; 
The way it is does not have to be 
As long as it stays unwritten 

And I'd stay for ages, if i could 
To wake you 
I'd stay for ages, If I could 
To wake you 

Speak to me in tongues 
And you speak in tongues to me 
Speak to me in tongues 
And you speak in tongues to me 

And I'd stay for ages, if i could 
To wake you 
And I'd stay for ages, If I could 
To wake you 

And I'd stay for ages, 
And I'd stay for ages to wake you
