Was a fast tough woman loved to play the clown
You won't do nothin' about it
Break a good boy's resistance down
You know she's got a pistol
Laid it down for real
She said shoot, shoot, shoot it boy
You gotta shoot it for me

Convinced me that she was worth it
Never knew I was her kill
And two 45's would do the trick and pay the bills

 You know she's got a pistol
Laid it down on me
And she said shoot, shoot, shoot it boy
You gotta shoot it for me

 I've really got to get a fast ride out of here
Gotta get a fast ride out of here
Gotta get a fast ride out of here
Gotta get a fast ride out of here now

Holing out in my hotel room police they finally come
And there's the prosecution, and my friends have palmed the gun
