You got me spinning, spinning around
I don't know if I'm up or I'm down
I'm coming back to you tonight

My pulse is racing, I'm out of control
My body's aching, it's taken it's toll
I'm coming back to you tonight

This darn freeway's driving me insane
I need a shot, a shot to ease the pain
I'm waiting...I'm waiting for the night
I'm waiting...bring on the night

My heart is pounding, I need you so much
My body's yearning, I long for your touch
I'm coming back to you tonight

I can't wait a minute longer
Every second the feeling get stronger
Coming back to you tonight

This darn freeway's driving me insane
I need a shot, a shot to ease the pain
I'm waiting...I'm waiting for the night
I'm waiting...bring on the night (bring on the night)

You got me spinning, spinning around
I don't know if I'm up or I'm down
I'm coming back to you tonight

I can't wait a minute longer
Every second the feeling's stronger
Coming back to you tonight

This darn freeway's driving me insane
I need a shot, a shot to ease the pain
I'm waiting...I'm waiting for the night
I'm waiting...bring on the night

I'm waiting...I'm waiting for the night
I'm waiting...bring on the night

Bring on the night
Bring on the night
I'm waiting

Bring on the night
Bring on the night
'Cause tonight I'm coming back to you
I'm waiting
Bring on the night




My mind is drifting, thinking of you
The love you're sending is making it through
I'm coming back to you tonight
The summer sun's still shining bright
Can't last forever, bring on the night
I'm coming back to you tonight
