I sang your praises daily
And we let ourselves get swept away
It's true baby
We held heaven in our hands for days
You wait a long time
For something wild to take you somewhere
And all I needed was to fly
It's a long way from paradise to ordinary
Picture us just smiling there, we didn't have a care

I remember, how it all came true
It was oh so tender
And I was lost with you
By the sweet sorrento moon

But the stars don't burn that brightly
Every season surely slips away
But you baby
You're the reason why I chose to stay
You wait a long time to find your dream and hold on to it
And all I needed was to fly
It's a long day from innocence to understanding
A picture of a child at play, is how I feel today

And I remember, how it all came true
It was oh so tender, and I was lost with you
By the sweet sorrento moon... (la luna de sorrento)
