Can't forget the day
That you walked into my life
It was just the kind of thing
That was so right on time
After all the love changes
My heart had locked the door
Then that girl released her magic
And made me love once more, ooh

Like the warm rays of the sun
Her sweet love came shining down on me, oh
All at once turned my life around
And with one kiss, she set me free

 She's given me joy, joy, joy
That girl, she brings me joy
She's given me joy, joy, joy
That girl, she brings me joy

Goodbye lonliness
And so long to my heartache
Now that joy has taken over
And decided to stay

Her love lifts me up
Like no other love before
With every beat of my heart
I'm hold, holding on, hey

Just look what she's done for me
She's erased all the sadness away, oh
I can never repay the deed
Cuz she keeps loving me more and more

 She's given me joy, joy, joy
That girl, she brings me joy
She's given me joy, joy, joy
She brings me joy

She's given me

Check one, check two
Can't hold back, I'm in love with you
Check one, check two
There's nothing in the world that I won't do for you

Check one check two
Can't hold back, I'm in love with you
Check one check two
There's nothing in the world that I won't do for you

That girl
She's given me joy, joy, joy
I love the way she loves me
She brings me joy
She's given me joy joy joy
A little bit of lovin' darlin'

Said I love it baby (Joy joy joy)
Oh girl, I love the joy she brings me (Joy joy joy)
She brings me joy, she brings me joy
Said I love it when you're loving me baby (Joy joy joy)
Oh girl, ya get me where you want me, baby (Joy joy joy)
