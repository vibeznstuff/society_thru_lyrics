All hail the jester has landed
In flyover country he sings
We're charmed like a snake in a basket
We should be coiled up and ready to spring
Raising a cross just to burn it
The clergy are selling their souls
Clearing a path, ignoring the facts
Intoxicated by the throne

But we'll be standing here holding our ground come what may
Like a ghost haunts from beyond the grave

Welcome to the breakdown
Welcome to the end of the road
Welcome to the breakdown
And we've got nowhere else to go

When we all go deaf in the chamber of echoes
Cheering the missile parade
Agreeing to let all the banks rob the people
Together we circle the drain

We'll be standing here holding our ground come what may
Like a ghost haunts from beyond the grave

Welcome to the breakdown
Welcome to the end of the road
Welcome to the breakdown
And we've got nowhere else to go
Welcome to the breakdown
Welcome to the end of the road
This is a breakdown
And we've got nowhere else to go

It's a game, you've been played
It's a flock, you're the sheep
It's a pied piper song that has lulled you to sleep
It's a lie and you fell for it, hook line and sinker
A hand that you shook that then gave you the finger
A fraud and a fake, a cowardly king
A lie to your face, but you still kiss the ring
This is the breakdown, this is the breakdown
This is the breakdown!

We are standing here holding our ground come what may
Like a ghost haunts from beyond the grave

Welcome to the breakdown
Welcome to the end of the road
This is a breakdown
And we've got nowhere else to go
Welcome to the breakdown
Welcome to the end of the road
This is a breakdown
And we've got nowhere else to go

It's not much but this is home
And there's nowhere else to go!
