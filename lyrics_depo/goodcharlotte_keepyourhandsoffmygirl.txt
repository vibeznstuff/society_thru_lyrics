Let the record play
Let the record play 
Let the record play 

The way that you dance
The way that you move 
The way that you stare at me across the room
You carry Dior bags,
And you got your Chanel
You wear Louis Vuitton, HG, and YSL
Now I got Bathing Ape
I got DCMA
I got brass knuckles hanging
From my neck in my chain
I got a model 26
But she stays in her place
I got a Kershaw neatly
Tucked inside in my waist

And the record keeps playing
The same old song
The hipster keeps mugging on me all night long
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl 
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
But the record keeps playing
The same old song
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl 

Now she sweating my friends
And my hurricane shoes
She likes the records I spin
My Adam Barton tattoos
But she can't say "what's up"
So what does she do
She just stays posted up
The other side of the room,
I got AMC tattooed on my hand
I got Black Wall Street on a black bandana

And the record keeps playing
The same old song
The hipster keeps mugging on me all night long
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl 
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
But the record keeps playing
The same old song
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl

She, she, she don't wanna talk about it
He, he, he wants to fight about
Me, me, I don't wanna fight about it
I just wanna be up out it
I'm just trying to stay up out it
Step out the wagon
You know the boy starts to hate
The girl that came with him
They like that's not the boy she dates
They get to fighting and swearing
And now the boyfriend is staring
The disco ball on the ceiling
Looks like the chain that I'm wearing 
But the music keeps playing
I got brass knuckles hanging 
From my neck in my chain
I got brass knuckles hanging
From my neck in my chain

And the record keeps playing
The same old song
The hipster keeps mugging on me all night long
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl 

And the record keeps playing
The same old song
The hipster keeps mugging on me all night long
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl

You carry Dior bags
And you got your Chanel
You wear Louis Vuitton, HG, and YSL
Now I got Bathing Ape
I got DCMA 
I got brass knuckles hanging
From my neck in my chain
I got brass knuckles hanging
From my neck in my chain
