Hottest, finest


Everybody wanna be, bearing jewellery,
safe in reality, running the city.
So you wanna be number one?
Don’t forget where you came from.
It’s not about me and you,
it’s about the things you do.
Most guys don’t have a clue, material issues.
How can I make you see,
the real things in life are free.


hottest, finest


(We all need someone)
That can show you what you true love is,
(Need someone)
That will never let you down,
(Need someone)
To tell you that they love you and always be around.


You could be the hottest, you could be the finest it don’t matter to me.
You could be the baddest, be the most stylish, you could be rolling in money.
It don’t matter what you got, if you heart is out of love,
You could be the hottest, you could be the finest it don’t matter to me.


I don’t mind pretty things, wouldn't mind a diamond ring,
but trust me I'll be tripling and take what life brings,
I gotta do what I do aside, but do what feels right.
I just wanna keep it real, that’s just how I feel.
It’s not about the J-O-B but the 
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.
How can I make you see,
the real things in life are free.

If you got it, you don’t have to flaunt it,
If I don’t show it don’t mean that I ain’t got it,
No it don’t mean a thing if you ain’t got real things,
