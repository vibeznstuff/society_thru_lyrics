By, oh by, the way of an explanation
Cast adrift of the shores of shorty's nation
I had a lick, it caved my skull in like a brick

Call now, what use am I to anyone
I'm fucked, forlorn, frozen beneath the summer
Don't sing along or you'll get what I got

So, here comes a delivery
Straight from the heart of my misery
So, here comes a delivery
Straight from my heart to you

Yeah you, now you, now you, you finally left school
Oh, what on earth do you intend to do?
See if you can take the man go downtown

Where all your skins and mods, you get together
Make pretend it's 1969 forever
Find a girl, have a drink, have a dance and play

It's a song that deliver me
Straight from the harshness of misery
Is a song that you'll ever hear
Straight from my heart to you

Yes, here comes a delivery
Straight from the heart of my misery
Or a song might deliver me
Straight from my heart to you

Yes, here comes a delivery
Straight from the heart of the misery
Here comes a delivery
Straight from my heart to you
