We have a breakdown
In communication
Nothing to say now
Just the hesitation.

I hear you calling my name,
Over and over again.
And I keep wondering (yeah)

If your feeling the way I'm feeling
Can we make it right
Coz time aint waiting for you baby
So come on over tonight

It should be easy
When I'm trying to love you
You say you need me
Are you sure you want to
Oh baby

Over and over again
