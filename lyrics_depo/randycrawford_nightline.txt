Call me on the nightline
Waking me up
Call me on the nightline
Can't get enough

Call me on the nightline
Whisper in my ear
Say me through the pipeline
What I like to hear

Every night around midnight
The call comes through
Turning on my night light
'Cause he'll know what to do

I'll be waiting by the phone, alone

Call me on the nightline, alone
Waking me up
Call me on the nightline
Can't get enough

Call me on the nightline
Whisper in my ear
Say me through the pipeline
What I like to hear

Make it person to person
Heart to heart
Darling, your flame
Is sending of sparks

I'll be waiting by the phone, alone

Call me on the nightline
Waking me up
Call me on the nightline
Can't get enough

Call me on the nightline
Whisper in my ear
Say me through the pipeline, baby
What I like to hear

Call me on the nightline
Call me on the nightline

Hello, is that you?

Call me on the nightline
Waking me up
Call me on the nightline
Can't get enough

Call me on the nightline
Whisper in my ear
Say me through the pipeline, baby
What I like to hear

Call me
I can't get enough
Call me on the nightline, baby
