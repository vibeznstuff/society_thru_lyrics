Highly suspicious, where was I last night
Seek and you shall find
And it goes in my mind, you make me draw the line
I didn’t commit any crime

I’m not guilty of what you’re saying I do
I’m not guilty of what you’re saying I do

Well Well Well

Why you giving me the third degree?
Why you giving me the third degree?

When I’m not guilty of what you’re saying I do
I’m not guilty of what you’re saying I do

I’m not that cagey
But I don’t need to explain
There’s nothing to blame

You’ll only drive me away
There’s so many questions everyday
You make me go insane

I’m not guilty of what you’re saying I do
I’m not guilty of what you’re saying I do

Well Well Well

Why you giving me the third degree?
Why you giving me the third degree?

When I’m not guilty, of what you’re saying I do
I’m not guilty, of what you’re saying I do

Well Well Well
Well Well Well
Well Well Well

I’m not guilty (I’m not guilty)
Of what you’re saying I do
I’m not guilty (I’m not guilty)
Of what you’re saying I do

Why you giving me the third degree?
Why you giving me the third degree?
Why you giving me the third degree?
Why you giving me the third degree?
