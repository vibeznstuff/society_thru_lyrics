It ain't gonna do my heart any good
To know that you're out with him again last night
Girl, I don't need a visual
Of his two arms wrapped around you tight

Was that gonna prove?
We both know that I'm your fool
So tell me something new
Lie that I can buy into
Just don't tell me the truth

Just this one time dance all around
The point you're trying to get across
Take my word, I don't need to be reminded
When it comes to you, I've already lost

Was that gonna prove?
We both know that I'm your fool
So tell me something new
Lie that I can buy into
Just don't tell me the truth

It's no front page news when it's over
We have been for sometime
Does it make you feel better
To drive me out of my mind?

Was that gonna prove?
We both know that I'm your fool
So tell me something new
Lie that I can buy into
Just don't tell me the truth

So tell me something new
Lie that I can buy into
Just don't tell me the truth
