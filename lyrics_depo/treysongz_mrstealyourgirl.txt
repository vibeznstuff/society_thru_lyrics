Baby I'mma be straight up
Don’t waste no time
I know you ain't my, you ain't my baby
Do you think about us
Do I cross your mind anytime


I know that you, you’re taken
It’ll never change
Cuz it’s always been that way
But you know that you
Can’t fake it
He can’t give you what I got here right now
Girl I know what you want
No phones, we ain’t even gotta talk
Next time that he leave you all alone
I’m gon’ come through, replace him
I’m gonna watch you
Get naked
I’m gonna tell you
Girl take it
Next time that he leave you all alone
I’ll give you all the love he denied
I’mm about to take his spot

Let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back
So let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back, back

Baby let me tell you what’s up
I don’t trust that nigga, fuck that nigga
Stop bringing him up
Baby, I ain't never gave no fucks
One fuck’s too much, unless you’re talking about us



Let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back
So let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back
I’ back
I’m gonna watch you
Get naked
I’m gonna tell you
Girl take it
Let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back
So let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back
