I can see the beginning
And I don't see the end
Wanna hold you an never let go - oh no
For as long as we're giving
And we never pretend
I believe in the future untold

We'll be stronger together
Than we would be apart
I can feel you inside my heart

Every day - Every night
Fill my shadows with light
When I feel all alone
Your heart is my home
Every night - Every day
You Show me the way to love
Show me the way to your love

Baby now that I've found you
Realise I was lost
Didn't know love could treat me this way
Maybe what it comes down to
When it matters the most
Is to find joy in every day

We could sink to the bottom
We could climb to the top
Cause Together We'll Never Give Up

Every day - Every night
Fill my shadows with light
When I feel all alone
Your heart is my home
Every night - Every day
You Show me the way to love
Show me the way to your love

Doesn't matter if we're far away
Got each other and that's all I ever need to know
Someone to call my own
We'll be Together Finally
We're Meant To Be

Every day - Every night
Fill my shadows - shadows with light
Every night and every day you
Show me the way to your love

Every day - Every night
Fill my shadows with light
When I feel all alone
Your heart is my home
Every night - Every day
You Show me the way to love
Show me the way to your love
