Oh oh oh oh oh
There's a friend of mine
Who's wasting all his money
Oh oh oh oh oh
Think he's had his time
Think he's lost his mind
Still a friend of mine
Oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
could have had it all
from the Albert hall
to the uni-ball
how the mighty fall
but I see them and us in you and me
and what was once before again maybe
cos I believe in the boogie baby
times are changing
everything will come around
we're just moving in circles baby
all or nothing
everything will come around
oh oh oh oh oh
he's a lonely gone
but isn't everybody
oh oh oh oh oh
Please to meet the sun
Pulls himself undone
Life can weigh a ton
But I see them and us in you and me
And what was once before again maybe
Cos I believe in the boogie baby
Times are changing
Everything will come around
We're just moving in circles baby
All or nothing
Everything will come around
I believe in the boogie baby
Times are changing
Everything will come around
We're just moving in circles baby
All or nothing
Everything will come around
(woooowoowooooo)
(oh oh oh oh ...................)
I believe in the boogie baby
times are changing
everything will come around
we're just moving in circles baby
all or nothing
everything will come around
I believe in the boogie baby
times are changing
everything will come around
we're just moving in circles baby
all or nothing
everything will come around
