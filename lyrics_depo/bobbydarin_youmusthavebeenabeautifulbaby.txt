Oh... you know, you know, you know, you know... 

You must a been a beautiful baby
You must a been a beautiful child 
When you were only startin'
To go to kindergarten 
I bet you drove those other childs wild!

Oh yeah... oh yeah... oh yeah... 
An' when it came to winnin' blue ribbons
Well... I bet you taught the other kids how 
Well, I can see the judge's eyes
As they handed you the prize
I bet you took the cutest bow! 

Yeah! You must a been a beautiful baby
'cause baby won't you look at you now. 

Oh yeah... oh yeah... oh yeah... 

You must a have been a beautiful baby
You must a have been a beautiful child
When you were only startin'

To go to kindergarten
I know you drove the other childs wild.
An' I wasn't even there.

An' when you came to winnin' blue ribbons
Hey... I know you taught those other kids how
Well, I can see the judge's eyes
As they handed you the prize
I know you made the cutest bow! 

Yeah! You must a been a beautiful baby
‘cause baby won't you look at you now. 
Oh, I mean... I mean... oh, beautiful...
Oh, beautiful...
Oh, beautiful...

Oh, beautiful...
Oh, beautiful...
Oh, beautiful...

Aah, I know you're beautiful... too beautiful for words...
