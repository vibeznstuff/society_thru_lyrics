 
The drumbeats go like this 
Yo, yo 
Now once again, my friend it’s the Reverend 
The first platinum status rap president 
And from the coast to California to the show the main, 
Got an east coast sound and my beats go bang 
My own black crown with my snickers got my name 
And I’m back yo, with my collar and cape 
Like a superhero armed with an old school tape 
It’s the Rev, yo, you gots to believe 

 
There’s a song for lovers you can hear all the time 
But you’re like no other to me 
So I’m not gonna promise you a starry sky 
You just need to believe 
(Just need to believe) 

 
I take time for my rhyme and I climb but don't reach 
Hustling when we rustle and grime and rock beats 
And this is it what? Another hit for the streets 
I got love for my people from queens to overseas 
Step into the room and then 'boom' the horns scream 
Rev's coming well and regal, I’ve got dreams 
Just like Martin Luther the King I might teach 
Rock a collar to the party after party going reach 

 
There’s a song for lovers you can hear all the time 
(All the time) 
But you’re like no other to me 
(Like no other, like no other) 
So I’m not gonna promise you a starry sky 
You just need to believe 
(You just need to believe) 

There’s a song for lovers 
But you’re like no other 
(Rev's coming well and regal, I’ve got dreams 
(Step into the room and then 'boom' the horns scream) 
There’s a song for lovers 
But you’re like no other to me 
You just need to believe 

(I'll be your friend) 
If you say you love me 
(I won't let you down) 
If you say you really care 
(Hold out your hands) 
If you say you really want me 
(I will be there) 
I promise I’ll be there, oh, oh 

I promise 
I promise 
And then I promise 
I’ll be there 

There’s a song for lovers you can hear all the time 
(All, yeah) 
But you’re like no other to me 
(Like no oither, like no other) 
So I’m not gonna promise you a starry sky 
(Nothing but a starry sky) 
You just need to believe 

There’s a song for lovers you can hear all the time 
But you’re like no other to me 
(Other to me) 
(Like no other, like no other) 
So I’m not gonna promise you a starry sky 
You just need to believe 
(Just need to believe) 
(You just need to believe) 

 
Faith is the substance of things hoped for 
(You just need to believe) 
The evidence of things not seen 
(You just need to believe) 
Your faith has made you whole 
(Yeah)
