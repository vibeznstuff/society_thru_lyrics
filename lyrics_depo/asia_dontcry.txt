Hard times you had before you
I knew when I first saw you
You girl you've always been mistreated, cheated

So leave it all behind you
It took so long to find you
I know that we can last forever, ever and more, more, oh

Don't Cry now that I've found you
Don't Cry take a look around you
Don't Cry it took so long to find you
Do what you want, but little darling please Don't Cry

I knew I'd never doubt it
I was so sure about it
Don't think of all that's been before

I'll hear you when you're calling
I'll catch you when you're falling
Don't worry I will always be there, like never before, or, oh
