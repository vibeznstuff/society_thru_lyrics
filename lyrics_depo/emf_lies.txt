You said too much
And what you said it was a lie
You said too much
And what you said it was a crime
I've bled too much
With every lie you keep on telling
I've bled too much
This time, each time

The harder we fall, the closer we are
I don't feel blue, when I'm with you
You said too much
And what you said, it was a lie
Lie
And what you said, it was a lie

Each time we fall
You say too much
This time, each time

This time I don't feel so blue
When I'm with you

I've got a gun, got hollow point bullets
Do it
That's the way destiny works
You don't always question it
Right now, do it now
