We should take this back to my place
That's what she said right to my face
'Cause I want you bad, yeah, I want you, baby
I've been thinking 'bout it all day
And I hope you feel the same way, yeah
'Cause I want you bad, yeah, I want you, baby

Slow, slow hands
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving here without you on me
I, I know, yeah, I already know that there ain't no stopping
Your plans and those slow hands
Slow hands

I just wanna take my time
We could do this, baby, all night, yeah
'Cause I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby

Slow, slow hands
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving here without you on me
I, I know, yeah, I already know that there ain't no stopping
Your plans and those slow hands

Fingertips putting on a show
Got me now and I can't say "No"
Wanna be with you all alone
Take me home, take me home
Fingertips putting on a show
Can't you tell that I want you, baby, yeah

Slow hands
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving here without you on me
I, I know, yeah, I already know that there ain't no stopping

Slow hands
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving here without you on me
I, I know, yeah, I already know that there ain't no stopping
Your plans and those slow hands

Slow hands
Slow hands
