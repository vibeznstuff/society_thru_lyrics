Cheers to the broken hearts 
To the ones that loved, the ones that helped the losing cards 
Here's to the sweet unknown 
To the tales untold that the night unfold in the stars above 

Pass around the bottle and tell me your troubles 
And la la la la la la love will save the day 
Yeah, pass around the bottle, and I'll share your troubles 
And la la la la la la love will save the day 

(Ohh...) With the undecided 
With the ones to try to find a way 
(Ohh...) Gonna burn the brightest 
Gonna watch the night go up in flames 
Pass around the bottle, and we'll share your troubles 
Sing la la la la la la love will save the day 

Friends, come and gather 'round 
Throw your hands up high to the silent sky where the answers found 
Let laughter fill the air 
Forget your worries, carry on without a care 

Pass around the bottle, and I'll share your troubles 
And la la la la la la love will save the day 

(Ohh...) With the undecided 
With the ones to try to find a way 
(Ohh...) Gonna burn the brightest 
Gonna watch the night go up in flames 

Let me ease your heavy heart and fill it up with gold 
Let the stormy seas depart and let me guide you home 

Pass around the bottle, and we'll share our troubles 
And la la la la la la love will save the day 

(Ohh...) With the undecided 
With the ones to try to find a way 
(Ohh...) Gonna burn the brightest 
Gonna watch the night go up in flames 

Pass around the bottle, and we'll share your troubles 
Sing la la la la la la love will save the day 
Pass around the bottle, and we'll share our troubles 
Sing la la la la la la love will save the day 

Sing la la la la la la love will save the day
