I'm the king of the swingers
Oh, the jungle VIP
I've reached the top and had to stop
And that's what botherin' me
I wanna be a man, mancub
And stroll right into town
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeyin' around!
Oh, oobee doo
I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you, too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be human too

Now don't try to kid me, mancub
I made a deal with you
What I desire is man's red fire
To make my dream come true
Now, give me the secret, mancub
C'mon, clue me what to do
Give me the power of man's red flower
So I can be like you

I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you, too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be human too

Now I'm the king of the swingers
Oh, the jungle VIP
I've reached the top and had to stop
And that's what botherin' me
I wanna be a man, mancub
And stroll right into town
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeyin' around!

Swing to the left, swing to the right
Put your hands up if you're lovin' life
Oh I'm lovin' life

Swing to the left, swing to the right
Put your hands up if you're feelin' nice
Oh I'm feelin' nice

Oh, oobee doo
I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you, too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be
Like someone like you
Can learn to be
Like someone like you
Can learn to be
Like someone like you
