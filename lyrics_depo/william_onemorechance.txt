Take me back
Take me back
Take me back

I...

Girls girls girls girls
Girls girls girls girls

Take me back

One more chance - this time around...
One more chance - let me undo what i've done before




One more chance
This time around...
One more chance
Let me undo what i've done before
Because i don't want to go
Another day, annother lonely night
I don't wanna be
Without you in my life
One more chance

Baby protect the love
Lalala (this time around)
Baby protect the love
Lalala
Baby protect the love
Lalala (this time around)




One more chance
This time around it's time for a different flow
A new romance
Do the things we've never done before

I love you
I really love you baby

Baby protect the love
Lalala (this time around)
Baby protect the love
Lalala
Baby protect the love
Lalala (this time around)
