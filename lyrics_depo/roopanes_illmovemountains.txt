Time will heal those broken eyes
Fashion you a face from your disguise
Loving never helped that lonely heart
The world a hostile city from the start

And no-one's towing your slip stream
You're a tigress with your wild dreams its true
And the leaden sky is drawing in
But I'll move mountains!

Oh Cry my friend no more
You've seen your stars aligning I am sure
You etched all of your circles in the sand
And now your hope's horizons are at hand

A light against the darkened sky
Your truth must outshine all the lies its true
But from the outside looking in
I say I'll move mountains!

Oh there's trouble on the East flank it is true
There's a wolf pack on your heels it's after you
And love is not a word that the world knows
Whilst fighting for survival from its foes

And some things take a life to learn
Your innocence forced to discern it seems
But from the outside looking in
I say I'll move mountains!
