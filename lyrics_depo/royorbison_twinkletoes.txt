Hey boys, gather round boys, the money's right 
Go down to low town for me tonight 
Walk onto forty four and knock on that big black door 
Lay some money on that man 
And get the very best table you can 

Well,there's a soul band's wailing behind the beat, 
And they cook when the blue lights spin. 
There's a "go-go girl"? yeah, 
She works it out,now. 
Look when you walk in, 
Yeah, yeah, yeah,yeah. 
Everybody knows 
To see her dance,now 
My Twinkle Toes. 

Twinkle Toes you move and you go, 
And you know you do it right. 
Up and down,now you dance around, now. 
You're look in good tonight, 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Come on, come on now. 
Twinkle Toes, 
Dance on and on, now. 

Yeah, but Twinkle Toes, 
I know you're trying 
To hide your broken heart; 
You act so gay. 
Yeah,behind the smile, 
I know you're crying. 
Your big great lonely eyes 
Give you away. 
Hey, hey,hey. 
Hey, hey ,hey. 

Twinkle Toes, 
You know you must hang on, girl. 
Hang on tight; 
Don't let your feelings show. 
Twinkle Toes, 
You know you must dance on,girl. 
If you work it right, 
They'll never know. 

Twinkle Toes, 
It's tough to forget, 
But every thing's all right. 
Yeah, Twinkle Toes, 
Get set, ‘cause I bet I take your home tonight, 
Yeah, yeah,yeah,yeah. 
Yeah, you're allright, now. 
Yeah, Twinkle Toes 
You're out of sight,now.

Yeah, you're so fine, girl. 
Yeah, Twinkle Toes, 
You've hurt my mind, girl. 
Twinkle Toes,

Now when the dance is through.
