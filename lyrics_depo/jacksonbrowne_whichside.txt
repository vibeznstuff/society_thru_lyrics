You might be a young man with the mountain in his step
In search of El Dorado, but you haven't found it yet
Or you might be an old man with his whole life at his back
And you can hear eternity whispering down the track
Or maybe you're a woman, or just about to be
And you can feel the generations swimming in your sea
But you know that it's coming, as surely as the dawn
The battle for the future, baby, which side are you on?

Come on come on come on if you're coming
Come on come on come on
Come on come on come on if you're coming
Which side are you on?
Come on come on come on if you're coming
Battle lines are drawn
Come on come on come on if you're coming
Which side - which side are you on?

Which side?
The corporations attacking
The natural world - drilling and fracking
All done with the backing of the craven and corrupt
Or the ones who fight
For the Earth with all their might
And in the name of all that's right
Confront and disrupt

There's a restlessness out in the street there's a question in the air
How long if this theft goes on will our country still be here?
People know the game is rigged even as they play
They see their expectations slowly slip away
They've got subsidies for billionaires, there's a bailout for the banks
A monopoly on medicine, and a sale on armored tanks
The whole damned country's being sold - out that revolving door
Between Washington and Wall Street like it's one big Dollar Store

Come on come on come on if you're coming
Come on come on come on
Come on come on come on if you're coming
Which side are you on?
Come on come on come on if you're coming
Battle lines are drawn
Come on come on come on if you're coming
Which side - which side are you on?

Which side?
The bankers and their special friends
Who rob you time and again
Who like to pretend they're the only game in town
Or the people who
Hope with everything they do
They can build something new
And turn this world around

Who owns the elections? Who profits either way?
Who ends up with all that money politicians pay?
To be the fearless leader, to put themselves across
To be the one entrusted with the profit and the loss
You try hard to believe that when you cast your vote it counts
But elections are won with money in ever larger amounts
Take the money out of politics and maybe we might see
This country turn back into something more like democracy

Come on come on come on if you're coming
Come on come on come on
Come on come on come on if you're coming
Which side are you on?
Come on come on come on if you're coming
Battle lines are drawn
Come on come on come on if you're coming
Which side - which side are you on?
