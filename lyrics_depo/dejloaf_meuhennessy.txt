Can we stay home tonight?
Try something new tonight.
This drink got me feeling right.
I'm 'bout to lose my mind.
U, me and Hennessy look what you did to me.
Fuckin' so crazy, you twirling and spinning me.
My head keep on spinning... my legs on keep on shaking
But my head keep on spinning. 
I'm out of mind let's keep on sipping. 
Let's make some babies and make it official.
I feel you inside, no better feeling. 
I throw it back and you catch my drifting.
You shifting inside, you got me screaming. 
You got me yelling out ya name ooh I need you.
You kiss on my thighs and then you eat it.
Pause for a minute then... I let you beat it.
I'm loving this ride.
Smooth like a Beamer. 
Smooth like that Henny, this what happens when we drinking. 
I'm not gonna lie.
You got me speechless. 
Got 69, more than 25 reasons. 

Me, Hennessy &amp; U.
Me, Hennessy &amp; U.
Me, Hennessy &amp; U.
Me, Hennessy &amp; U.
U, Me &amp; Hennessy, look what you did to me.
I say my head keep on spinning.
Me, Hennessy &amp; U.
Ay, this what happens when we drinking. 
Me, Hennessy &amp; U.
Me, Hennessy &amp; U.
