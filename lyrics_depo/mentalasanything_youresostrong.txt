I walk along right next to you
You seem to know just what to do
Your body tries to infiltrate
Our privacy it's hard to wait
Easy darling you can't ignore
All of the reasons that I love you for
The way we cook, the way you win
When you want to love me I just must give in

Try not to break me baby you're so strong
You mightn't think so but I know, you're so strong
You picked me up and took me home
Straightened me out but didn't leave me alone
The way you hug the way you kiss
I don't know how much more I can take of this
Try not to break me baby you're so strong
You mightn't think so but I know, you're so strong

I walk along right next to you
You seem to know just what to do
Your body tries to infiltrate
Our privacy it's hard to wait
Easy darling you can't ignore
All of the reasons that I love you for
The way you hug the way you kiss
I don't know how much more I can take of this

Try not to break me baby you're so strong
You mightn't think so but I know, you're so strong
Try not to break me baby
Try not to break me baby
Try not to break me baby
You're so strong
