Every where is freaks and hairies, dykes and fairies
Tell me where is sanity?
Tax the rich, feed the poor, till there are no rich no more
I'd love to change the world - but I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you

Population - keeps on breeding, nation bleeding,
Still more feeding economy
Life is funny, skies are sunny, bees make honey
Who needs money? Monopoly!
I'd love to change the world - but I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you... Oh yeah

World pollution, there's no solution, institution, electrocution
Just black and white, rich or poor, them and us
We'll stop the war!
I'd love to change the world - but I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you... It's called luck
