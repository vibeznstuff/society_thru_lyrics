I HOPE YOU`RE FEELING HAPPY NOW
I SEE YOU FEEL NO PAIN AT ALL IT SEEMS
I WONDER WHAT YOU`RE DOIN` NOW
I WONDER IF YOU THINK OF ME AT ALL
DO YOU STILL PLAY THE SAME MOVES NOW
OR ARE THOSE SPECIAL MOODS FOR SOMEONE ELSE
I HOPE YOU`RE FEELING HAPPY NOW

JUST BECAUSE YOU FEEL GOOD
DOESN`T MAKE YOU RIGHT, OH NO
JUST BECAUSE YOU FEEL GOOD 
STILL WANT YOU HERE TONIGHT

DOES LAUGHTER STILL DISCOVER YOU
I SEE THROUGH ALL THOSE SMILES 
THAT LOOK SO RIGHT
DO YOU STILL HAVE THE SAME FRIENDS NOW
TO SMOKE AWAY YOUR PROBLEMS AND YOUR LIFE
OH HOW DO YOU REMEMBER ME,
THE ONE THAT MADE YOU LAUGH UNTIL YOU CRIED
I HOPE YOU`RE FEELING HAPPY NOW

JUST BECAUSE YOU FEEL GOOD 
DOESN`T MAKE YOU RIGHT, OH NO
JUST BECAUSE YOU FEEL GOOD
STILL WANT YOU HERE TONIGHT

WANT YOU: 
I WONDER WHAT YOU`RE DOING NOW
I HOPE YOU`RE FEELING HAPPY NOW
