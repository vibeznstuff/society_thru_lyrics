You had me
You lost me
You're wasted
You cost me
I don't want you here messing with my mind

Spitting in my eyes and I still see
Tried to keep me down
I'm breaking free
I don't want no part in your next fix
Someone needs to tell you this is it

Hey listen you'll be missin' 
Out on all my love and my kissing
Make your mistakes on your own time 
When you come down you're just no good to have around
Instead of making money you took mine


You had me
You lost me
You're wasted
You cost me
I don't want you here messing with my mind
I've realized in time 
that my eyes are not blind
I've seen it before
I'm taking back my life

You tried to trade on my naivete
But the things you do and say embarrass me
See once upon a time I was your fool 
But the one I leave behind is you

Hey listen you'll be missin' 
Out on all my love and my kissing
Make your mistakes on your own time 
When you come down you're just no good to have around
Instead of making money you took mine



Vodka and a packet of cigarettes
That's all it used to be but now
You're sniffing on snow when you're feeling low
Suffocating dreams that could have been
Maybe for a minute I was down with that
But it didn't take long for me to see the light
You swore you had control of it 
But when I stepped back you slipped on your supply



Taking it back I'm taking it back
Taking back my life
Taking it back I'm taking it back
Taking back my life
Ain't nobody got no business stressing all the time
Taking it back I'm taking it back
Taking back my life



Taking it back I'm taking it back
Taking back my life
Taking it back I'm taking it back
Taking back my life
Ain't nobody got no business stressing all the time
Taking it back I'm taking it back
Taking back my life
