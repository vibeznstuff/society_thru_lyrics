People rushing left to right
There's pretty faces left to right
I'm just frozen staring into space

Faster than the speed of light
I'm holding on, I'm holding tight
Cause stars are gonna crash into this place

And it's caught wide screen so we dont miss a thing
Now I'm standing clear
cause all I waited for is

Closing in,
We've still got twenty four hours
We're closing in,
We've still got twenty four hours

This is more than daily bread,
It's three degrees, It's something else,
And you just take it all into your stride

Couldn't be an accident
Cause I cant see no ambulance,
I know that we will work it out this time

And its caught wide screen so we dont miss a thing
Now I'm standing clear 'cause all I waited for is...

Closing in,
We've still got twenty four hours
We're closing in,
We've still got twenty four hours

Closing in,
We've still got twenty four hours
Now we're closing in,
We've still got twenty four hours

It's not over, It's not over
We've still got twenty four hours
It's not over, It's not over yet
We've still got twenty four hours
