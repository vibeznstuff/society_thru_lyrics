And now the marriage vow is very sacred
The man has put us together now
You ought to make it stick together
Come on, come on, let's stick together
You know we made a vow not to leave one another never

But now you never miss your water till your well runs dry
Come on now baby give our love a try
Let's stick together
Come on, come on, let's stick together
You know we made a vow not to leave one another never

Well if you're stuck for a while consider our child
How can it be happy without its ma and pa
Let's stick together
Come on, come on, let's stick together
You know we made a vow not to leave one another never

Well if you're stuck for a while consider our child
How can it be happy without its ma and pa
Let's stick together
Come on, come on, let's stick together
You know we made a vow not to leave one another never
