Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
To love you


So open the door and come down
Can't you see that I'm trying?
Don't say another word about the other boy
Can't you see that I'm dying?


This time things will be different
And you're gonna see
This time things will be different
Are you gonna see?
See...
These hands will become unwrapped
You love their touch again
This time things will be different
And you're gonna see
See...


Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
To love you




One more chance
Give me one more chance
One more chance
Give me one more chance
To love you



See...
