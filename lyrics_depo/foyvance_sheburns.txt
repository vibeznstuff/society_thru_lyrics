She's a little explosion of hope
Never turns the lights down low, she can go there if you want to though
There are no markings on her country roads
No signs that show the way back home
When you get there you won't wanna go

I’ve frozen all my desire
Covered up in virgin snow
But when I stand beside her

She burns yeah she burns
Like petrol soaked paper and fireworks
And I’m burning yeah I’m burning
I’m burning so deep that just breathing hurts
I’m melting darling, I can’t let go

She likes to lay under the covers though
Pretending everywhere’s our home
Keeps me warm right to my very soul
We get so tangled up its hard to know
What is hers and what’s my own
Vines at the bottom of an olive grove

I’ve frozen all my desire
Covered up in virgin snow
But when I stand beside her

She burns yeah she burns
Like petrol soaked paper and fireworks
And I’m burning yeah I’m burning
I’m burning so deep that just breathing hurts
I’m melting darling, I can’t let go
I’m melting darling, I can’t let go
I’m melting darling, I can’t let go

I’ve frozen all my desire
Covered up in virgin snow
But when I stand beside her

She burns yeah she burns
Like petrol soaked paper and fireworks
And I’m burning yeah I’m burning
I’m burning so deep that just breathing hurts
I’m melting darling, I can’t let go
I’m melting darling, I can’t let go
I’m melting darling, I can’t let go
