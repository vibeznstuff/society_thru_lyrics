I didnt know when I was lucky
Discontented feeling bad
Filled with envy
For possessions other people had

I found my pride had always hurt me
Fought the world to gain control
Not realising
I was sitting on a beach of gold

Oh lord Im a poor man
With all the riches I can hold
Im a beggar
And Im sitting on a beach of gold

The problems I encountered
Gave me strength helped me sustain
To know the pleasure
First I had to cure the pain

When I was searching for solutions
I found the answer lay in me
Im a drifter
But Im drifting on a silver sea

Oh lord Im a poor man
With all the riches I can hold
Im a beggar
And Im sitting on a beach of gold

I didnt have courage
My life was as dark as night
When alone in the darkness
I saw the brightest light
Let the light shine down

Are you out there now on empty
Feel youve nothing left to give
Sick of trying
Have you lost the will to live?

Dont be drowning in the shallows
With the beach so near at hand
Hear the voice say
Stand up get up
And join me on the gilded sand

Come and join me on the beach
With all the riches I can hold
Cause Im a beggar
And Im sitting on a beach of gold

Oh lord Im a poor man
With all the riches I can hold
Im a beggar
Im sitting on a beach of gold

My children my salvation
The father to this man
Theyre my teachers
Playing on the golden sand

With my family all around me
Ive all the riches I can hold
Im a beggar
Sitting on a beach of gold

Oh lord Im a poor man
With all the riches I can hold
Im a beggar
Sitting on a beach of gold
