Going to a go-go
Going to a go-go (Na, na, na, na, yeah, yeah)

Well, there's a brand new place I found
Where people come from miles around
They come from everywhere and if you drop in there
You might see anyone in town

Going to a go-go (Everybody)
Going to a go-go (Come on now)
Don't you wanna go, yeah (Yeah)

Oh, sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I love you
Oh, I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

Oh, you're in and out my life (In and out my life)
You come and you go (Come and you go)
Leavin' just your picture behind (Ooohooohooo)
And I've kissed it one thousand times, hey, hey, hey, hey

Baby, everything is alright
Uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright
Uptight, out of sight

Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart

Think it over
Oh, think it over

I tried so hard to be patient
Hopin' you'd stop this infatuation
But each time we are together
I'm so afraid of losing you forever

Stop

You're sweet (You're sweet) as a honey bee
But like a honey bee stings you've gone and left my heart in dreams
All you left (All you left) is our favourite song
The one we danced to all night long

You used to bring (Bring) sweet memories
Of a tender love that used to be

Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning since you've been gone
Same (Same) old song (Song)
But with a different meaning since you've been gone

Love you, oh, baby
