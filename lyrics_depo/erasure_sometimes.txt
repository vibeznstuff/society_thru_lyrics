It's not the way you lead me
By the hand into the bedroom
It's not the way you throw your clothes
Upon the bathroom floor
Been thinking about you
I just couldn't wait to see
Fling my arms around you
As we fall in ecstasy

Ooh sometimes
The truth is harder
Than the pain inside (Yeah)
Ooh sometimes
It's the broken heart
That decides

It's not the way you caress me
Toy with my affection
It's not my sense of emptiness
You fill with your desire
Climb in bed beside me
We can lock the world outside
Touch me satisfy me
Warm your body next to mine

Ooh sometimes
The truth is harder
Than the pain inside (Yeah)
Ooh sometimes
It's the broken heart
That decides

Ooh sometimes
The truth is harder
Than the pain inside (Yeah)
Ooh sometimes
It's the broken heart
That decides

Ooh sometimes
The truth is harder
Than the pain inside (Yeah)
Ooh sometimes
It's the broken heart
That decides

Ooh sometimes
The truth is harder
Than the pain inside (Yeah)
Ooh sometimes
It's the broken heart
That decides

Ooh sometimes
The truth is harder
Than the pain inside (Yeah)
Ooh sometimes
It's the broken heart
That decides
