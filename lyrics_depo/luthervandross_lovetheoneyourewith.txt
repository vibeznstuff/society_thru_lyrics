There's a Rose
In a fisted Glove
and the eagle flies 
with the dove
and if you can't be 
with the one you love
it's alright
Go ahead and love the one, 
love the one, 
love the one your with
love the one, 
love the one, 
love the one your with
If your guy can't come to you
and you don't remember 
who your talking to
your concentration slips away
because your baby, 
she is so so far away

And there's a rose 
in a fisted glove
and the eagle flies 
with the dove
and if you can't be 
with the one you love
love the one your with
Don't be angry
don't be sad
Don't sit cryin' 
for good times you had
There's a girl right next to you
and she's waiting 
for something to do

Do it
do it
do it
Turn your heartache into joy
She's a girl and your a boy
get together, make it tonight,
you ain't gonna need no more advice

Just love the one your with
