December will be magic again
Take a husky to the ice
While Bing Crosby sings White Christmas
He makes you feel nice

December will be magic again
Old Saint Nicholas up the chimney
Just a-popping up in my memory

Ooh, dropping down in my parachute
The white city, she is so beautiful
Upon the black-sooticicled roofs

Ooh, and see how I fall
See how I fall (Fall!)
Like the snow

Come to cover the lovers (Cover the lovers but don't you wake them up)
Come to sparkle the dark up (Sparkle the dark up with just a touch of make-up)
Come to cover the muck up (Cover the muck up, ooh, with a little luck)

December will be magic again
Light the candle-lights
To conjure Mr. Wilde

Into the Silent Night
Ooh, it's quiet inside
Here in Oscar's mind

December will be magic again
Don't miss the brightest star
Kiss under mistletoe
I want to hear you laugh
Don't let the mystery go now

Ooh, dropping down in my parachute
The white city, she is so beautiful
Upon the black-soot icicled roofs

Ooh, and see how I fall
See how I fall (Fall!)
Like the snow

Come to cover the lovers (Cover the lovers but don't you wake them up)
Come to sparkle the dark up (Sparkle the dark up with just a touch of make-up)
Come to cover the muck up (Cover the muck up, ooh, with a little luck)

Oh, I'm coming to cover the lovers
Ooh, and I'm coming to sparkle the dark up
Ooh, and I'm coming to cover the muck up
