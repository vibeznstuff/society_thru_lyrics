I looked into her eyes
Saw through her disguise
But never realised
That we were longing to be free
run away to sea,
well that could never be.

Goodbye, don't say goodbye, 
I'd rather die than say goodbye.

Once so very long ago, 
was when I loved you so,
if only I had known.
I was blinded by my fate,
I traded love for hate,
now I just sit and wait.

Goodbye, don't say goodbye, 
I'd rather die than say goodbye.

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

Goodbye, don't say goodbye, 
I'd rather die than say goodbye.
