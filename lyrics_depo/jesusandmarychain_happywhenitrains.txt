Step back and watch the sweet thing
Breaking everything she sees
She can take my darkest feeling
Tear it up till I'm on me knees
Plug into her electric cool
Where things bend and break
And shake to the rule
Talking fast couldn't tell me something
I would shed my skin for you
Talking fast on the edge of nothing
I would break my back for you
Don't know why, don't know why
Things vaporise and rise to the sky
And we tried so hard
And we looked so good
And we lived our lives in black
But something about you felt like pain
You were my sunny day rain
You were the clouds in the sky
You were the darkest sky
But your lips spoke gold and honey
That's why I'm happy when it rains
I'm happy when it pours
Looking at me enjoying something
That feels like feels like pain
To my brain
And if I tell you something
You take me back to nothing
I'm on the edge of something
You take me back
And I'm happy when it rains
