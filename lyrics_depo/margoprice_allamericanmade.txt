I woke up from a movie I immediately forgot
I got a heartache on the bottom and a headache on the top
The part of me that hurts the worst is the one I just can't spot
And it's all American made

Through everywhere I go, somebody puts me in the dirt
And everything I say, somebody says they said it first
But I don't need ten million, baby just give me one that works
It's all American made

I have been all over but I can't help feeling stuck
Something in my blood line or something in my gut
Says go to California in a rusted pickup truck
It's all American made

1987 and I didn't know it then
Reagan was selling weapons to the leaders of Iran
And it won't be the first time and baby, it won't be the end
They were all American made

But I was just a child unaware of the effects
Raised on sports and Jesus and all the usual suspects
So tell me, Mr. Petty, what do you think will happen next
It's all American made

And I wonder if the president gets much sleep at night
And if the folks on welfare are making it alright
I'm dreaming of that highway that stretches out of sight
And it's all American made
It's all American made
It's all, it's all American made
