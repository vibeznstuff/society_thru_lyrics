I had a bad dream last night
The whole world was ending, right before my eyes.
There were fires and there were floods
And everyone was running out of time.
It made me think what I'd do
If we really came to the end of the life.

I don't think I'd spend my last hours at an altar
Or somewhere making toasts to good old days.
The more I think about it, all I'd really wanna do
Is watch the world end with you.

I'd lay down in a field by your side
And watch every star falling out of the sky,
And I'd steal a kiss from your sweet lips one last time,
And I wouldn't be afraid as long as your hand was in mine.

I don't think I'd spend my last hours at an altar
Or somewhere making toasts to good old days.
The more I think about it, all I'd really wanna do
Is watch the world end with you.
Watch it end with you.
With you.

I don't think I'd spend my last hours at an altar
Or somewhere making toasts to good old days.
The more I think about it, all I'd really wanna do
Is watch the world end with you.
I'd watch the world end with you.
With you.
