Knock on my door
You're on my porch
It's about 11:30
And that only means
One of two things
Either you're a little bit lonely
Or something ain't right
And judgin' by
The tear in your eye
You're about to say something crazy
Like goodbye


Stop right there
Don't say a word
Just let me hold you
Girl, we can fix
Whatever it is
So whatever you do
Don't let us die
The love of a lifetime
Is worth at least a million tries
Baby what we got
Is too good for goodbye

This ain't a game
I'm trying to play
Girl, we got something real here
You don't just break up
Whenever it gets tough
So, baby, don't you leave here
I want you to say
You're gonna stay
And we're in this thing forever
Come whatever, so



It's too good for goodbye



Yeah, it's too good for Goodbye
