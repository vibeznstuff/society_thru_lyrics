I heard the sound of voices in the night,
Spell bound there was someone calling,
I looked around no one was in sight
Pulled down and I kept on falling
I've seen this place before
And you were standing by my side
I've seen your face before tonight
Maybe I just see what I wanted to be
I know it's a mystery
Do you remember me
On a street of dreams,
Running through my memory
On the street of dreams

There you stood a distant memory
So good like we never parted
Said to myself I knew you'd set me free
And here we are right back where we started
Something's come over me
And I don't know what to feel
Maybe this fantasy is real
Now I'm gonna see what I wanted to be
But it's still a mystery

Do you remember me
On a street of dreams,
Running through my memory
On the street of dreams
You are on every face I see
On the street of dreams

(music... wow!)

Something's come over me
And I don't know what to feel
Maybe this fantasy is real
Now I'm gonna see what I wanted to be
But it's still a mystery

Do you remember me
On a street of dreams,
Running through my memory
On the street of dreeeeaaaaams

On the street of dreams
And will you always feel
On the street of dreams
Will we ever meet again my friend
On the street of dreams
Do you know just what it feels to be
On the street of dreams
Ever know just who you'll see
On the street of dreams
Don't you think who you'll wanna be oh no
On the street of dreams
I can hear you calling me
On the street of dreams
I can feel you haunting me...
