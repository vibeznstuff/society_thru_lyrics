Nobody else could make me happy
No one could hurt me like you do
You were the only one That mattered

Then you were gone...Love had moved on
Left me alone thinking of...

You...There was never any other
You...and I were created to be true

Isn't it Love that keeps us breathing
Isn't it love we're sent here for
Wasn't that love that we were feeling
(That was something baby)

Deep in our soul...Deeper than we know
Keeping me holding out for

You...There was never any question
You'll be forever on my mind

You and I, we were meant to be together
True hearts in a world where love is dyin'

And I might as well have been dyin' when
We were apart
When you came back I felt the beating of my heart

You...There was never any question
You'll be forever on my mind
You and I, we were meant to be together
You...and only you

It was you...only you
You...Always you
