warm sun feed me up
i'm leery loaded up 
loathing for a change
and i slip some
boil away
swallowed followed
heavy about everything 
but my love
swallowed sorrowed
i'm with everyone and yet not
i'm with everyone and yet not
i'm with everyone and yet not
just wanna be myself
hey you said that you would love to try
some
hey you said that you would love to die
some
in the middle of a world on a fishhook
you're the wave
you're the wave
you're the wave
swallowed borrowed
heavy about everything
but my love
swallowed hollowed
sharp about everyone
but yourself
swallowed oh no 
i'm with everyone and yet not
i'm with everyone and you're not
i'm with everyone and yet not
piss on self-esteem
forward busted knee
sick head 
blackened lungs
and i'm a simple selfish son
swallowed followed
oh no i'm with everyone and yet not
got to get away from here
got to get away from here
i miss the one that i love a lot
i miss the one that i love a lot
