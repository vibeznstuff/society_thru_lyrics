I'm a high wire act, without a net
I'm a tips all in on a losing bet
I'm a minor cord on an old guitar
I'm one too many in a crowded bar

Don't you wanna fall
Don't you wanna fall
Fall down here where an angel should know better than
To walk around this world with me
All the girls love to talk about forever
From way up here the talk is always cheap
Don't you wanna fall
Don't you wanna fall

You're that first good buzz at 17
You're the good guy winning on the movie screen
You're a candle burning in the church in Rome
You're a first class ticket on the last plane home

But don't you wanna fall
Don't you wanna fall
Fall down here where an angel should know better than
To walk around this world with me
All the girls love to talk about forever
From way up there the talk is always cheap
Don't you wanna fall
Don't you wanna fall

Fall down here where an angel should know better than
To walk around this world with me
All the girls love to talk about forever
From way up there the talk is always cheap
Don't you wanna fall
Baby don't you wanna fall
