Sun tanned, wind blown, honeymooners at last alone
Feeling far above par, Oh how lucky we are..

While I give to you and you give to me,
True Love, True Love
so on and on it will always be
True Love, True Love

For you and I have a guardian angel
on high, with nothing to do
but to give to you and to give to me
love, forever true..



Love, Forever true
