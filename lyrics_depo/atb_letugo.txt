I've been to all the familiar places
I've been running like a sentence never begun
I've been looking for a way to let you know
I got nothing left to fill the spaces
I got nothing but a sentence coming undone
I've been doing circles and it shows

I've been to all the familiar places
I've been running like a sentence never begun
I've been looking for a way to let you know
I got nothing left to fill the spaces
I got nothing but a sentence coming undone
I've been doing circles and it shows

Every cloud beyond the sky
Every place that I hide
Tell me that I, I was wrong to let u go
Every sound that I hear
Every force that I feel
Tell me that I, I was wrong, I was wrong to let u go

Let u go
Let u go
Let u go

Let u go
Let u go
Let u go

It's the little things that make you crazy
Like the thought of someone touching your skin
I can see you everywhere I go
You could be inside a sea of faces
It could be the rumor of your grin
Swimming in the river as it flows

Every cloud in the sky
Every place that I hide
Tell me that I, I was wrong to let u go
Every sound that I hear
Every force that I feel
Tell me that I, I was wrong, I was wrong to let u go

Every cloud in the sky
Every sound that I hear
Let u go
