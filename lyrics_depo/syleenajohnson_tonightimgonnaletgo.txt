I know that I made you wait for a very long time
'Cause I wasn't ready baby for you to come inside
I wanted you to know my name and not just what's between my thighs
I wanted you to play the game because I knew you get the prize
But the game is over baby, no more you need to fantasize
'Cause I'm not letting go so come and put your lips on mine
And I won't even hesitate, oh no baby not this time
I'm gonna give you all my loving. Gonna make up for lost time 


I just wanna, I just wanna break free
And let you put your hands all over me
I just wanna lose control
Tonight I'm gonna let go
So baby come and put your arms around me
'Cause I think I'm ready to be all you need
And nobody has to know
Tonight I'm gonna let go

Won't you come a little closer while I slowly dim the lights
And put your hands up on my body. Baby you can take your time
Ain't no need to rush baby 'cause we got all night
I just want to scream your name and make you want to scream mine
I tried to fight the feelin' baby. Boy you got me hypnotized
But I can't help that I've been feenin' lately. I think about you all the time
Tonight I'm gonna get aggressive baby so don't you fear put up a fight
Tonight I'm gonna put it on you baby. Sit back, relax, enjoy the ride
