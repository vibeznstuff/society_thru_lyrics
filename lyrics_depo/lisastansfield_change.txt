If I could change the way I live my life today
I wouldn't change a single thing
'Cos if I change my world into another place
I wouldn't see your smiling face

Honey don't you worry, there's nothin' to worry for
'Cos if I didn't love you I wouldn't be here now
And if I didn't want you I would have turned around by now

You've got to believe me babe, believe that I love you so
'Cos if I didn't love you I would have turned around
And if I didn't want you, then I would want you out

This love, this love has filled me up
Ooh my love I'll never give you up
'Cos I'll always want your love

If I could change the way I live my life today
I wouldn't change a single thing
'Cos if I change my world into another place
I wouldn't see your smiling face

Believing is the answer, the answer to all your fears
When I first said I loved you, I went in for the kill
Now when I say I love you, I mean I always will

This love, this love has filled me up
Ooh my love I'll never give you up
'Cos I'll always want your love

If I could change the way I live my life today
I wouldn't change a single thing
'Cos if I change my world into another place
I wouldn't see your smiling face

This love, this love has filled me up
Ooh my love I'll never give you up
'Cos I'll always want your love

If I could change the way I live my life today
I wouldn't change a single thing
'Cos if I change my world into another place
I wouldn't see your smiling face
