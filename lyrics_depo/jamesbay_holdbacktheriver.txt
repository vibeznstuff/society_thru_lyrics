Tried to keep you close to me,
But life got in between
Tried to square not being there
But it's there that I should've been

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river,
So I can stop for a minute and see where you hide
Hold back the river, hold back

Once upon a different life
We rode our bikes into the sky
But now we're caught against the tide
Those distant days all flashing by

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river,
So I can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river, hold back

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river,
So I can stop for a minute and see where you hide
Hold back the river, hold back

Oh, oho, oho, oho, oho
Oho, oho, oho, oho

Lonely water, lonely water,
Won't you let us wander?
Let us hold each other?
Lonely water, lonely water,
Won't you let us wander?
Let us hold each other?

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river,
So I can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river, hold back

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river,
So I can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river
Hold...
 Hold back the river
 Hold back...

Lonely water, lonely water,
Won't you let us wander?
Let us hold each other?
Lonely water, lonely water,
Won't you let us wander?
Let us hold each other?
