do you feel the way you hate
do you hate the way you feel
always closest to the flame
ever closer to the blade
i am poison crazy lush
built these hands to lift me up
we are servants to our formulaic ways
i'm screaming daisies
from 14 miles away
i've got my own time
got it all today
make up your mind
i need some help
to find this mind
limbo this and limbo that
you were this and you were that
ever know that what you fear is what you
find
this indian summer
i signed my life away
there's a greedy fly in here
and i fly away
