Gather the wind
Though the wind won't help you fly at all
Your back's to the wall
Chain the sun and it tears away
And it breaks you as you run, you run, you run

Behind the smile there's danger and a promise to be told
You'll never get old
Life's fantasy, to be locked away
And still to think you're free, you're free, we're free

So live for today
Tomorrow never comes

Die young, die young
Can't you see the writing on the wall?
Die young, gonna die young
Someone stopped the fall

Gather the wind
Though the wind won't help you fly at all
Your back's to the wall
Chain the sun and it tears away
And it breaks you as you run, you run, you run

So live for today
Tomorrow never comes

Die young, young
Die young, die young
Die young, die young, young
Die young, die young, die young, die young, die young!
