(Uh-huh, uh-huh) Yeah, Holly
(Uh-huh, uh-huh) Good girl gone bad
(Uh-huh, uh-huh) Take three...action!
(Uh-huh, uh-huh) Woah!

You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
May be in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
'Cause I...

I'm singin' in the rain (We'll shine together)
Just singin' in the rain (We'll be forever)
What a glorious feeling (Be a friend)
And I'm happy again (Stick it out 'til the end)
I'm laughing at clouds (More than ever)
So dark, up above (We'll share each other)
I'm singin', singin' in the rain (Umbrella)
You can stand under my umbrella (Ella, ella, eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella (Ella, ella, eh eh eh eh eh eh)

These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the world has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
'Cause I...

I'm singin' in the rain (We'll shine together)
Just singin' in the rain (We'll be forever)
What a glorious feeling (Be a friend)
And I'm happy again (Stick it out 'til the end)
I'm laughing at clouds (More than ever)
So dark, up above (We'll share each other)
I'm singin', singin' in the rain (Umbrella)

You can stand under my umbrella (Umbrella)
Ella, ella, eh eh eh (Just singin' in the rain)
Under my umbrella (What a glorious feeling)
Ella, ella, eh eh eh (And I'm happy again)
Under my umbrella (I'm laughing at clouds)
Ella, ella, eh eh eh (So dark, up above)
Under my umbrella (I'm singin')
Ella, ella, eh eh eh eh eh eh (Singin' in the rain...)

It's rainin', rainin'
Ooh, baby it's rainin', rainin'
Baby, come here to me
Come here to me
It's rainin', rainin'
Ooh, baby it's rainin', rainin' (More than ever)
Baby, come here to me
Come here to me

It's rainin', rainin' (I'm singin' in the rain)
Ooh, baby it's rainin', rainin' (Just singin' in the rain)
Baby, come here to me (What a glorious feeling)
Come here to me (And I'm happy again)
It's rainin', rainin' (I'm laughing at clouds)
Ooh, baby it's rainin', rainin' (So dark, up above)
Baby, come here to me (The sun's in my heart)
And I'm ready for love

My umbrella, my umbrella
My umbrella, my umbrella
