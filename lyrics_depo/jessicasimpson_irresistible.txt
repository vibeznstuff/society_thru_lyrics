You know I don't know what it is 
But everything about you is so irresistible

Don't you try and tell me that he's not my type
To hide what I feel inside 
When he makes me weak with desire
I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase but I can't
Stop fanning the fire, I know I meant to say no

But he's irresistible 
Up close and personal 
Now inescapable 
I can hardly breathe, more than just 
Physical deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
And irresistible to me (yeah yeah, I can hardly breathe)

Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right
That I should really say goodnight
But I cant stop myself from falling (falling)
Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same
That I don't want to play no game (No)
Cuz when I Feel his arms wrapped around me
I know I'm meant to say no (I meant to say LNo...)

But He's Irresistible (Irresistible)
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe (I can hardly breathe)
More than just physical  
Deeper than spiritual (oh oh yeah)
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me

Can't You see whenever he's close to me
I really find it hard to breathe
He's so irresistible
Baby you know its more than just spiritual
His kisses are powerful

He's so irresistible (yeah yeah)
Up close and personal (oh yeah)
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe (I can hardly breath)
More than just physical (oh yeah)
Deeper than Spiritual 
His ways are powerful 
Irresistible to me

He's irresistible (yeah yeah)
Up close and personal (irresistible to me)
I can hardly breathe
More than just physical 
Deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me....
