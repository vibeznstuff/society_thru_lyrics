Plastic brain scar, I want laser
I'm your chauffeur, with high
Gloss highs
Take you where you want

Can't stop, oh, off the train
Train yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh

Wolf lady sucks my brain
Apricot sunrise came
L.A. nights
Just roll in

Can't stop, oh, off the train
Train, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
Can't stop, oh, off the train
Train yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh

Nasal douche, poolside line
Soft lit tan, what's your sign?
Hold my hand
Just roll in

Can't stop, oh, off the train
Train yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
Can't stop, oh, off the train
Train yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh

Can't stop, oh, off the train
Train yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
Can't stop, oh, off the train
Train, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
