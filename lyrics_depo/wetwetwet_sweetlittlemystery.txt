My love has taken a tumble
Oh, but I'm still standing
You're such a natural, sing,
That's what you are

Say I wouldn't steer you wrong now baby
I wouldn't steer you wrong

It's just that sweet little mystery
That makes me try, try, try, try
It's just that sweet little mystery
That makes me try, try, try, try

Didn't I come resisting this sight of wonder
Didn't I come insisting the higher decision
Didn't I come resisting this sight of wonder
To your life

Say I wouldn't steer you wrong now baby
I wouldn't steer you wrong

It's just that sweet little mystery
That makes me try, try, try, try
It's just that sweet little mystery
That makes me try, try, try, try

Oh, just think of the magic ooh-ooh
Don't think it is tragic, hey hey hey
Just think of the magic

Come on listen

My love has taken a tumble
My love has taken a tumble
My love has taken a tumble
But I'm still standing

It's just that sweet little mystery
That makes me try, try, try, try
It's just that sweet little mystery
That makes me try, try, try, try

Come on listen
Try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try
Try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try
