Uh, Yeah
Shake shake shake shake
Shake shake shake shake

Bad ass strippa gonna flip you on your back
Grab you to the bed
Take your stag and fifty dollar bill

Shake shake shake shake
Shake shake shake shake

On the table
International rock cable
Top never ever stop
Drop you to the ground like a cop

Shake shake shake shake
Shake shake shake shake

I'm a dancer
High quality romancer
I'm a tease
If you freeze
Them im gonna seize for your money

Shake shake shake shake
Shake shake shake shake

I'm high class
Fill up my champagne glass
I'm a choke
If you're a broke, man
Cause your jokes ain't funny

Bad ass strippa in the escalade
Jump out the truck im in St Tropez

There's enough men out there trying to check me
Talking to my sister trying to get through to me
Thinking of my face when their feelin lonely
And the all wanna phone me
Get to know me
Sittin the cell
With your hands on your head
Lookin at the four walls
Wishing you were dead
You be getting jiggy when you listen to my rhythm
Rock every damn block in your prison

Uh, Yeah

Bad ass strippa in the escalade
Jump out the truck im in St Tropez

Shake shake shake shake
Shake shake shake shake

Boys on a beach and they wanna play
So I strips off into Burberry

Shake shake shake shake
Shake shake shake shake

Bad ass strippa in a Gucci thong
See through dress by Louis Vuitton

Shake shake shake shake
Shake shake shake shake

Bounce on the hot and
Dance round a pole
Show 'em what I got
I'm out of control

Bad ass strippa in the escalade
Jump out the truck im in St Tropez

I have come to show you how to party
You have got to get with this
I wont take no sh*t from nobody
Wont take no lyrical diss

Uh, Yeah

Whining
Shake shake shake shake
Whining
Shake shake shake shake
Whining
Shake shake shake shake
Whining
Shake shake shake shake
