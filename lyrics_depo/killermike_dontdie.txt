I woke up this morning to a cop with a gun
Who told me that he looking for a n! gga on the run
I thought for a second and I screwed my face
And asked the dirty pig "Why the fuck you in my place? "
He said "Chill or we kill, this is a warning"
Then I told him "fuck you, Where is the warrant? "
Then they got to punchin' and kickin' and macin'
Then the Whole situation went Larry Davis
Thinking 'bout my lady and thinking 'bout my baby
Thinking "these two motherfucking pigs going crazy"
They wanna kill a n! gga 'cause a nigga on this rap shit
Wanna leave me dead on a mattress, Hampton
I'm a Public Enemy because I'm Cold Lampin'
And I don't give a fuck about a party in The Hamptons
And I don't give a fuck about a motherfuckin' Forbes List
Far as I'm concerned, that's a motherfucking whores list

Motherfucker, my dad was a cop
You don't think I know a dirty ass cop when I see one?
Shake down, take down, disrespecting-the-badge-ass-bitch!

Back to the scene going wild in the bedroom
Grab the cop's gun left from leaking with a head wound
Second cop shot, but the bullet hit his partner
Shot him in the leg and he hit him in the arter (y)
Now the dirty cop's looking at me
Talking 'bout he kill a nigga if I try to flee
Shit, I'm about to loose it, so he gon' have to prove it
All because the government hate rap music
I've been labeled outlaw, renegade, villain
So is Martin King, so the system had to kill him
A nigga with an attitude, the world gotta feel him
Educated villain, attempt on living
If I gotta kill a cop just to get out the building
That motherfucker didn't, left dead, no feelings
Yelling "Fuck him" as I buck A 45 at his fillings
Trying to knock his brains through the motherfucking ceiling

When I surface on the streets I can hear the crowd yelling
And see the neighborhood snitches pointing and telling
I'm bailing like a felon or Assata Shakur
Before the law leave me stinking like a bag of manure
Like Jeriko One in the movie 'Strange Days'
They want a nigga dead 'cause the things that I say
Might make the youth go and pick up an AK
Tell the government "Fuck you, no way"
Like John Connor mama I be running everyday
'Cause if I get caught it's my life they terminate
Or stick me in a cell on Guantanamo Bay
All because a n! gga won't sit in and obey
I'll be an outlaw before I ever behave
And die a free man before I live like a slave
Nothing changes, if they catch me today
"Fuck the police" is still all I gotta say
