We came to dance 
Making moves from a passion play
The ties that bind us just slip away

We came to dance
The piper calls out a different rhyme
He cracks the whip and we step in time

Standing 
As the parade goes passing by
I hear a voice around me cry
Like the sound of distant drums
Rejected and alone
A heart without a home 
And someone said

We came to dance 
Making moves from a passion play
The ties that bind us just slip away

We came to dance
The piper calls out a different rhyme
He cracks the whip and we step in time

We came to dance

Waiting 
As the panic grips my hand
Hearing prose from high command
Like a million times before
No dignity or grace
It's the prize and not the race 
And someone said

We came to dance 
Making moves from a passion play
The ties that bind us just slip away

We came to dance
The piper calls out a different rhyme
He cracks the whip and we step in time

We came to dance

We came to dance 
Making moves from a passion play
The ties that bind us just slip away

"Take what you can," they said.
"Take it while you may
But keep in mind 
The penalty fits the crime
And it deals no softened blow."

We came to dance 
Making moves from a passion play
The ties that bind us just slip away

We came to dance
The piper calls out a different rhyme
He cracks the whip and we step in time

We came to dance 
Making moves from a passion play
The ties that bind us just slip away

We came to dance
The piper calls out a different rhyme
He cracks the whip and we step in time

We came to dance 
Making moves from a passion play
The ties that bind us just slip away

We came to dance
The piper calls out a different rhyme
He cracks the whip and we step in time
