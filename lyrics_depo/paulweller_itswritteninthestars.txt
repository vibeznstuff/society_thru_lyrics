It's written in the wind
That we're two
Carved out in the sand
That we're real
It's lit up in the stars
That we're true
We're destined in the sky
To be glad

We're hopelessly informed
That we're meant
We're conscious of the fact
That we're supposed
To be so sure
And we are
We're driven by the
Rain to act

We're suspect to the laws
Passed for real
When we're the realest
Thing we've seen
Taken by the hand from above
I really do feel
We work for love

And it's written in the stars
Meant for us
Soaked into the sand
Made by time
Taken by the hand from above
I really do feel
That we work for love

It's written in the wind
That we're two
Carved out in the sand
That we're real
It's lit up in the stars
That we're true
We're destined in the sky
To be glad
