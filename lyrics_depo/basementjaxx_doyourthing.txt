I don't need no tv, I don't need no news
All I need is a bumpin beat to bump away my blues
I don't give a damn what the people say
I'm gonna do it, gonna do it my way
Gonna let it all out an do my thing
Boom boom boom an a bang bang bang
Oooh-do your thing
Do your thing, make my body sing
Do your thing, your thing, my thing, oh oh oh oh
Say shut your mouth you're in a fatal tiz
Free the mayhem in your mind, release the need inside of you You're gonna suffer
Do your thing, do you
Boom boom boom an a
Oooh-Do your thing
Do your thing, make
Do your thing, your
Give me ying-yang
Do your thing, make
Do do do
