You don't know what you're doin'
What you're doin' to me
Try to stop me, can't stop me
Cos you got what I need
You got me all open and now you trying to leave
Hold it, don't drop it (don't drop it)
Stop it (can't stop it, won't stop it)

Every time I try to run, something keeps stopping me (stopping me)
I try my best to turn around, but your touch won't let me leave
I can't control it, you put something inside of me
Cos you're a problem
Boy you must a poisoned me


You don't know what you're doin'
What you're doin' to me
Try to stop me, can't stop me
'cause you got what I need
You got me all open and now you trying to leave
Hold it, don't drop it
Don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it
Won't stop it
