Happy life with the machines scattered around the room.
Look what they made; they made it for me... happy technology!
Outside the Lions roam feeding on remains...
We'll never leave, look at us now;
So in love with the way we are here!


The world that the children made...
The world that the children made, here!
The world that the children made, here!
The world that the children made.

Every night they rock us to sleep, digital family!
Is it real? Or is it a dream? Can you believe in machines?
Outside, the beating sun, can you hear the screams?
We'll never leave, look at us now.
So in love with the way we are here!





Happy life...with the machines scattered around the room.
Look what they made, they made it for me; happy technology!
Outside the lions roam feeding on remains.
We'll never leave, look at us now;
So in love with with the way we are here!
