The only thing she left was a tear stained letter
Said it's too late to try and make things better
I guess she's good as gone 
I left her lonely too long

She held on waiting on me to change
But any kind of fool could've found a way to say I did you wrong 
I left you lonely too long

And I should've saw it coming from a mile away
But I was just in time to watch her taillights fade
I'd give anything if she'd turn that car around and just come back home 
But it's sure looking like she won't
I left her lonely too long, lonely too long

I should've thought about her instead of myself
Put her love first before anything else
That's where she belonged 
But I left her lonely too long

And I should've saw it coming from a mile away
But I was just in time to watch her taillights fade
I'd give anything if she'd turn that car around and just come back home 
But it's sure looking like she won't
I left her lonely too long, lonely too long

And I should've saw it coming from a mile away
But I was just in time to watch her taillights fade
I'd give anything if she'd turn that car around and just come back home 
But it's sure looking like she won't
I left her lonely too long, lonely too long
