Where you running to now, baby?
Running all the time.
Where you running to now, darlin'?
Running to all the time.
Well, I sure hope it’s to your sister
And not that mean brother of mine.

I’ve been trying to reach you, darlin'.
I try, I try in vain.
I’ve been trying to reach you, darlin'.
Though I try, I try in vain.
I always end up losing you
And walking home in the rain.

Wedding ring, wedding ring;
Little band of gold.
Wedding ring, wedding ring;
Little band of gold.
Will you be strong enough to keep her,
Keep her love from going cold?

There’s a wildcat in you, woman,
A wildcat on the prowl.
There’s a wildcat in you, woman,
A wildcat on the prowl.
Every time I put my arms around you
I can hear that wildcat growl.

I remember when I met you
There was something about the moon.
I remember the night I met you
There was something about the moon.
I don’t know if it was waxing or waning,
But I knew that you’d be leaving soon.

Wedding ring, wedding ring;
Little band of gold.
Wedding ring, wedding ring;
Little band of gold.
Will you be strong enough to keep her,
To keep her love from getting old?

Wedding ring, wedding ring;
Little band of gold.
Wedding ring, wedding ring;
Little band of gold.
Will you be strong enough to keep her,
To keep her love from going cold?

Will you be strong enough to keep her,
To keep her love from getting old?
Will you be strong enough to keep her,
To keep her love from going cold?
