I can't be that other woman
I can't be that other woman

You only see me every Friday night at nine
Can't imagine what you told her this time
You never take me to a public place
Worried that somebody might notice your face
Rush to the liquor store and then a motel
Call up your friends just to cover you're trail
Not a word until the week goes by 
You call me when you want some pie

Why am I crying every night over you
You're never gonna leave her
Finally I woke up and smell the coffee
I understand
Why two women can't share one man

I can't be that other woman
I can't love you down
Can't keep creepin' around
Can't be that other woman
Yes I want you bad
But she needs you much more

I can't be that other woman
I can't love you down
Can't keep creepin' around
Can't be that other woman
Yes I want you bad
But she needs you much more

You never see me on the holidays
You disappear and won't return my page
You take my body in the middle of night
I ain't gon lie cause boy you do it so right
And then you melt with them same three words
Sweetest seduction that I've ever heard 
And in the morning with the sun rise
You run to her I realize 

Why am I crying every night over you
You're never gonna leave her
Finally I woke up and smell the coffee
I understand
Why two women can't share one man

I can't be that other woman
I can't love you down
Can't keep creepin' around
Can't be that other woman
Yes I want you bad
But she needs you much more

I can't be that other woman (See)
I can't love you down (What goes around comes around)
Can't keep creepin' around
Can't be that other woman
Yes I want you bad (I want you oh so bad)
But she needs you much more (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Can I get a witness
(Yes you can)
Can I get a witness
(oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
Can I get a witness
(You know you can)
Have you ever been in love with another girl's man
Can I get a witness
(Yes you can)
Can I get a witness
(oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 

You said you're leaving a thousand times
But I won't believe til the papers are signed

Can't be that other woman
I won't believe it no
I gotta be the only one
Yes I want you bad 
But she needs you much more 

I can't be that other woman
I can't love you down
Can't keep creepin' around (No more late night booty calls)
Can't be that other woman
Yes I want you bad
But she needs you much more

In the morning with sunrise
You will run to her
