Shh!!
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
All I can say is
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl


Let's Go!
I don't need nobody else around see
Love the way you compliment my style
Though you may end up bein' my only girl
'Cause when you're with me you're my whole world
Like when it's just me and you
Vibe is crazy between us two
You're my homie, my lover and even my friend
Now I said this before ima say it again

Now here is the situation
I like what we've got happening
And I don't want nothing coming in between both me and you
I'll let you be lieutenant if you let me be captain
Tell me if that's cool


Baby I want you to be my entourage
(Super fly chick)
You could be my personal superstar
(Super fly chick)
Baby I want you to be my entourage
(Super fly chick)
If you want then we could take this very far
(Super fly chick)


You're a star in your own right
At times you steal the whole spotlight
I don't mind girl you're fine, put a smile on my face
Besides who want a chick that no dude would chase?
Sometimes I know your unsure
Wonder if this will endure
Don't make me make a promise that I can't keep
'Cause it's cool how it is, let's not complicate things girl

Here is the situation
I like what we've got happening and I don't want nothing coming in between both me and you
I'll let you bee lieutenant if you let me be captain
Tell me if that's cool




You're a star (Omarion)
That you are (so beautiful)
Be my girl (I wanna take it to the top)
Share my world (all the way to the top, yeah!)
Come on girl (Whoo! Super fly chick)
