Disco dancing with the lights down low
Beats are pumping on the stereo
Neighbours banging on the bathroom wall
Your sayin' crank the bass
I gotta get some more

Waters runnin' in the wrong direction
Got a feelin' it's a mixed up sign
I can see it in my own reflection
Summit funnies goin' on inside my mind
Don't know what it's pushin' me higher
It's the static from the floor below
Then its drops and catches like a fire
It's a sound I, it's a sound I know

It's the sound of the underground
The beat of the drum goes round and round
In to the overflow
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio
Out to the electric night
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights
The beat goes around and round
It's the sound of the under
Sound of the underground

Chain reaction running through my veins
Pumps the bass line up into my brain
Screws my mind until I lose control
And when the building rocks I know it's got my soul

Waters runnin' in the wrong direction
Got a feelin' it's a mixed up sign
I can see it in my own reflection
Summit funnies goin' on inside my mind
Don't know what it's pushin' me higher
It's the static from the floor below
Then its drops and catches like a fire
It's a sound I, it's a sound I know

It's the sound of the underground
The beat of the drum goes round and round
In to the overflow
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio
Out to the electric night
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights
The beat goes around and round
It's the sound of the under
Sound of the underground

I don't know what it's pushin' me higher
It's the static from the floor below
And then it drops and catches like fire
It's a sound I, it's a sound I
It's a sound I, it's a sound I know

It's the sound of the underground
The beat of the drum goes round and round
In to the overflow
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio
Out to the electric night
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights
The beat goes around and round
It's the sound of the under
Sound of the underground

The bass line jumps in the backstreet light
It's the sound of the under
Sound of the underground
The bass line jumps in the backstreet light
It's the sound of the under
Sound of the underground
