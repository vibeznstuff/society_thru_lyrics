I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
When it comes to you
I could make love on the floor
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
Baby let's get creative
Cause of you I am down
I'm down for whatever


There's no place I wouldn't go
Tonight I'm ready to take it anywhere
I'm amazed, by you all
You bring out a side i didn't know

Say the word, and I'll do anything, can't say no to you
It ain't juice, mixed with booze
No baby every word is true


I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
When it comes to you
I could make love on the floor
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
Baby let's get creative
Cause of you I am down

I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
When it comes to you
I could make love on the floor
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
Baby let's get creative
Cause of you I am down

I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever


Let's explore, see what we find
I'm waiting for you to discover me
No restraints, no regrets
Just give me your eye, I won't forget

Say the word, and I'll do anything, can't say no to you
It ain't juice, mixed with booze
No baby every word is true


I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
When it comes to you
I could make love on the floor
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
Baby let's get creative
Cause of you I am down

I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
When it comes to you
I could make love on the floor
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
Baby let's get creative
Cause of you I am down

I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever


Tonight, you're making everything feel right
Tonight, I wanna get high and touch the sky


I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
When it comes to you
I could make love on the floor
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
Baby let's get creative
Cause of you I am down
