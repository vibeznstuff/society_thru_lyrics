The best of times is now,
What's left of summer but a faded rose!
The best of times is now,
As for tomorrow, well who knows,
Who knows, who knows!

So hold this moment fast (hold it fast)
And live and love as hard as you know how (you know how)
And make this moment last (moment last)
Because the best of times is now,
Is now, is now!

Now! not some forgotten yesterday,
Now! tomorrow is too far away!

So hold this moment fast,
And live and love as hard as you know how,
And make this moment last,
Because the best of times is now,
Is now, is now!

The best of times is now,
What's left of summer but a faded rose!
The best of times is now,
As for tomorrow, well who knows,

Who knows, who knows!

Now! (this is the moment we should take)
Not some forgotten yesterday
(yesterday is just a faded memory)
Now! (don't let this moment go to waste)
Tomorrow is too far away! (too far, too far away)

So hold this moment fast,
And live and love as hard as you know how,
And make this moment last,
Because the best of times is now,
Is now, is now!

The best of times is now,
What's left of summer but a faded rose!
The best of times is now,
As for tomorrow, well who knows,
Who knows, who knows!

So hold this moment fast,
And live and love as hard as you know how,
And make this moment last,
Because the best of times is now,
Is now, is now!
