Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world?
But how can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?
What am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world?
How can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?

First time that I saw you, boy
It was a warm and sunny day
All I know is I wanted you
I really hoped you look my way
Baby, you smiled at me
So warm and sweet
I could not speak
You make me feel
Like a little bitty girl
What do you do to me?

Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world?
But how can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?

I guess I'll see you next lifetime
No hard feelings
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
I'm gon' be there

Your energy
Feels so damn good to me
It picks me up
Don't wanna come down
You got me spinning all around
Yeah
You need to know
I've got somebody
But you're beautiful
But still it ain't that type of party

Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world?
But how can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?
Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world?
(I know, I know I'm selfish.)
But how can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?

Well I guess I'll see you next lifetime
Maybe we'll be butterflies
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
That sounds so divine
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
I guess I will now
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
Wait, wait a little while

See it ain't nothing wrong with dreaming
Boy, don't get me wrong
'Cause every time (every time) I see you (every single time)
It lets me know just how strong (every single time)
That my love is for my baby
But emotions just don't lie
Well, I know I'm a lot of woman
But not enough to divide the pie

Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world?
But how can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?

I guess I'll see you next lifetime
You know I want to stay around
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
I'm so confused now

Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world?
But how can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?

I guess I'll see you next lifetime
I'm already
I'm gon' be there
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
I'm gon' look for you

Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world?
But how can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?

I guess I'll see you next lifetime
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
I guess I'll see you next lifetime

Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world?
But how can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?

I guess I'll see you next lifetime
'Cause what we got is so divine
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
Next time I'mma make you mine
