Pushing all the buttons
Trying to come to something
Flying with his feet on the ground
Full of dreams and visions
In a world of indecision
He ain't around to be pushed around

Been a long time coming on
Take a look at him now
And the days of If are gone
'cause he's showing us how

Knowledge fuels the mind of the few
In a way that no - one's found
Brave new answers screaming the truth
And the techno wins the crown



Micro-kid with mega-thoughts
He is real, he is here, he is fashionable
Micro-kid speaks digitalk
If you hear what he says it's acceptable

Generating square waves
While computing new games
Finally gets the chips off his back
A smile is on his face
Erasing every trace
Of doubt that plagues the rest of the pack

And his brain stores memories
No alternatives could come in
He's the living remedy
Times are better than they were then

Knowledge fuels the mind of the few
In a way that no-one's found
Brave new answers screaming the truth
And the techno wins the crown
