You must have heard it from my best friend
She’s always talkin’ when she should be listenin’
Can’t keep a secret to save her life
But still I trusted her with all I felt inside
I never knew, a rumor could spread so fast
‘Cause now the word is out all over town
That I’m longing for you

How did you kn..
