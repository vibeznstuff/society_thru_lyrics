Hello honey, it's me
What did you think when you heard me back on the radio?
What did the kids say when they knew
It was their long lost daddy-o?

Remember how we listened to the radio
And I said "That's the place to be"
And how I got the job as an FM jock
The day you married me?

We were two kids and I was was into AM rock
But I just had to run around
It's been eight years since I'd left you babe
Let me tell you 'bout what's gone down

I am the mornin' DJ on W O L D
Playin' all the hits for you wherever you may be
The bright good-mornin' voice who's heard but never seen
Feelin' all of forty-five goin' on fifteen

The drinkin' I did on my last big gig
You made my voice go low
They said that they liked the younger sound
When they let me go

So I drifted on down to Tulsa, Oklahoma
To do me a late night talk show
Now I worked my way down home again, via Boise, Idhao
That's how this business goes

Well I am the mornin' DJ on W O L D
Playin' all the hits for you wherever you may be
The bright good-mornin' voice who's heard but never seen
If you keep on singing on alone like that
You're gonna turn the little girls off

I've been making extra money to a high school sock hops
I'm a big time guest MC
You should hear me talking to the little children
And listen what they say to me

The spot on the top of my head
Just begging for a new toupee
And a tire on my gut from sittin' on my
But it's never gonna go away, stay children

Sometimes I get this crazy dream
That I just take off in my car
When you can travel on ten thousand miles
And still say where you are

I've been thinking that I should stop disk jockeying
And start that record store
Maybe I could settle down
If you'd take me back once more

Ok honey, I see
I guess he's better than me
Sure, old girl, I understand
You don't have to worry, I'm such a happy man

W O L D
W O L D
W O L D
W O L D D D

I am the mornin' DJ on W K T
Playin' disco pushship and you know what you can do
The bright good mornin' voice who's heard but never seen
Feeling all of forty-five, goin' on fifteen
How's that?
I am the mornin' DJ at W O L D
