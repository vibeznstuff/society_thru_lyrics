Woke up this morning to a different world
They're stomping on immigrants and groping girls
There's nothing American about us now
A whole population driven underground

But I still believe in our democracy
Warts and all it's still the land of the free
So take it outside, shout it loud as you can
Defend the rights of every woman and man

That's who we are
That's how I feel
That's who we are
Hey, can't you feel it getting real?
That's who we are
That's how I feel
That's who we are
Can't you feel, can't you feel?

In times like this we oughta stay together
But they just pitted us against each other
Just give it some time though and you will see
That we all have a common enemy

It's the man who says it's okay to hate
But we know that hate will destroy this place
So right now I'm asking you to join our side
And take a stand to fight for what's right

That's who we are (Strength in difference)
That's how I feel
That's who we are (Be the resistance)
Can't you feel it getting real?
That's who we are (Unite for justice)
That's how I feel
That's who we are (It isn't just us)
Can't you feel, can't you feel it getting real?

Woke up this morning to an ugly place
The scum rising from a masterbating race
There's nothing American about us now
Have we forgotten what we're all about
Cause I still believe in our democracy
And equal rights for every race and creed
So take it outside, shout it loud as you can
We won't let sexism or bigotry stand

That's who we are (Honor in protest)
That's how I feel
That's who we are (Anti-racist)
Can't you feel, can't you feel?
That's who we are (Anti-fascist)
That's how I feel
That's who we are (Anti-potus)
Can't you feel, can't you feel it getting real?

Can't you feel for the world
For the tired, poor, huddled, war-torn
We're not a rock (We're all equal)
We're not an island (Multi-cultural)
We have a role to play
To make people's lives better every day
That's who we are (Fight the power)
That's how I feel (We're taking over)

How I feel
