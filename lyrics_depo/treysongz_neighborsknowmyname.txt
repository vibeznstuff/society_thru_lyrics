Soon as we get started makin love goin harder hear a.. (knock knock) knocking on the wall,
And as soon as I go deep getting it in then again theres a.. (knock knock) knocking on the wall,
Girl your legs keep shakin I swear we breakin our new headboard headboard
And the love we make it feels so good girl you know im proud lookin in your lovely face scream my name you do it so loud


I bet the neighbors know my name

Bet the neighbors know my name
They be stressin while we sexin,
I bet the neighbors know my name
My name my name
I bet the neighbors know my name

Take this pillow right here (grab this)
And I know youre so excited if you bite it they wont hear
And you know just what we capable of, when we makin love
So the music gone be loud, you gone scream and shout
Girl your bodys a problem, they call me the problem solver
Let phone sit on the charger, it could ring all night
They can call, they can knock, and be upset, but I bet




I I i be bangin on yo body, they be bangin on our wall
While they dreamin, you be screamin now they bangin on our door
Sometimes she call me trey, sometimes she say tremaine
When its all said and done but the neighbors know my name
Sometimes she call me trigga cause I make her body blush
They might think my name is OH SHHHHH, I make her cuss


I bet the neighbors know my name
Way you screamin scratchin yellin,
Bet the neighbors know my name
They be stressin while we sexin
I bet the neighbors know my name
My name my name
I bet the neighbors know my name
Neighbors know my name
I bet the neighbors know my name
Way you screamin scratchin yellin,
Bet the neighbors know my name
They be stressin while we sexin
I bet the neighbors know my name
My name my name
I bet the neighbors know my name


The way you scream my name (the way you scream my name)
Woah
Girl the love we make (girl the love we make)
Gone keep on bangin on the wall, but nothings gonna change
I bet the neighbors know my name
