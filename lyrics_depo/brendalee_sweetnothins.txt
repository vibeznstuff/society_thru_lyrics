 Uh huh, Honey
 Alright

My baby whispers in my ear (pst pst pst)
Mmmm sweet nothin's
He knows the things I like to hear (pst pst pst)
Mmmm sweet nothin's
Things he wouldn't tell
Nobody else
Secret baby
I keep 'em to myself
Sweet nothin's
Mmmm sweet nothin's

We walk along hand in hand
Mmmm sweet nothin's
Yeah, we both understand
Mmmm sweet nothin's
Sittin' in the classroom trying to read my book
My baby give me that special look
Sweet nothin's
Mmmm sweet nothin's

Ah, sittin on my front porch (pst pst pst)
Mmmm sweet nothin's
Well, do I love you? Of course (pst pst pst)
Mmmm sweet nothin's
Mama turned on the front porch light
Sayin', "Come in darlin', that's enough for tonight"
Sweet nothins
Mmmm sweet nothin's
Sweet nothins
Mmmm sweet nothin's

Sweet nothins
