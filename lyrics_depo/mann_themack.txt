Return of the Mack, come on
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, I do
Cause you know that I'll be back


Here come the brand new new in your ear
This feel like the nominated song of the year
Feeling damn good up in here
Cause I'm represented from my old hood up in here
But I'm not about to get ghetto though,
Mingling with some women feeling incredible.
Hell I'm tryna bag a chick from the centerfold
And I'm tryna burn bread like it's finna be toast
Finally up in the game and they feeling me coach
Cause I'm first class flyin' I ain't finna be coach
Yeah, this is celebration; never in, tell a friend
Girl, the Mack is back.


We can take the Benz and hit the street
Let the top down so they all can see
We can hit the clubs and party hard
Cause I just bought out the bar.
We can G-fly from coast to coast,
Pop champagne let's make a toast
Now we're sippin' on Patron
Smoke that kush till we get blown

Return of the Mack, come on
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, I do
Cause you know that I'll be back

Let me hear you say ya
Let me hear you say west
Let me hear you say ya
Every day we stay fresh, fresh


I got keys to whatever trees of endeavor
Mann, he was buzzed and he's on my level
He's on the pedal, drive off slow
Seven deuce Cadillac is convertible
She wanna be where the Mackin' is at
It's the Dogg in the house while I'm crackin' it back
They say, we say, you say Dogg
Take it to the top, now drop it down low
Milf on my back, suited and booty
Crimped out, pimped out
What would you do if he was me,
Would you hop on a freak, while you bob to the beat
Now we can take...


The Benz and hit the street
Let the top down so they all can see
We can hit the clubs and party hard
Cause I just bought out the bar.
We can G-fly from coast to coast,
Pop champagne let's make a toast
Now we're sippin' on Patron
Smoke that kush till we get blown

Return of the Mack, come on
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, I do
Cause you know that I'll be back


Honey dip, I got a thick money clip
And he broker than a joke, that isn't the funniest
 with the lavish life
It's a one time offer, won't ask you twice
When we go shopping mamma don't as the price
Gotta get accountant to get me cash advice
When it come to the  I'm a mastermind
I speak classic line right after classic line
And that ass is fine, I think 
Yeah, it's a celebration day; never in, tell a friend
Girl, the Mack is back.
