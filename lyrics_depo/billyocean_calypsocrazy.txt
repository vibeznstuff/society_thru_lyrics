Lady
You're driving me crazy all night

I need your loving
But all you do is tease me

And that ain't right.

People dancing everywhere
Calypso music in the air

Oh
You're driving me wild
Calypso Lady.
People dancing all around
Calypso Lady
Shake it down

Oh
When you're driving me wild
Calypso crazy.

Lady
Come on out to party
Make it right

I'd love to touch you
Yeah
And feel you close beside me.
I wanna hold you tight!

Oh
You're driving me wild
Calypso Lady.

And if you should ask me now what I feel

Oh
I tell you that you're the one I love.
So if you wanna take a chance with me
One day
And you'll see.
Oh
Let it be
Let it be me!
