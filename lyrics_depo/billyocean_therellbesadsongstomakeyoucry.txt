Sometimes I wonder by the look in your eyes
When I'm standing beside you
There's a fever burning deep inside.

Is there another in your memory
Do you think of that someone
When you hear that special melody?

I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song touch the very heart of me.


There'll be sad songs to make you cry -
Love songs often do.
They can touch the heart of someone new -
Saying I love you.
(I Love you)

I often wonder how it could be - you loving me -
Two hearts in perfect harmony.
I'll count the hours until that day
A rhapsody plays a melody for you and me.

Until the moment that you give your love to me
You're the one I care for
The one that I would wait for.



You're my desire
You take me higher
My love is like a river running so deep.

I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song touch the very heart of me.



Sayin' I love you...
I love you
