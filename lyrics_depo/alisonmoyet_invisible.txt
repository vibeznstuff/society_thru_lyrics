You've got me so confused and there's word I could use
But I'm afraid to say them.
I feel I've been had and I'm boiling mad

Still I can't live without you.
You don't have the time and you won't spend a dime
Not even to call me.
You don't know I exist and I wouldn't be missed
If I had the nerve to quit you.

Invisible - I feel like I'm invisible.
You treat me like I'm not really there
and you don't really care.
I know this romance
it ain't going nowhere.
Invisible just like my love. You treat me like I'm invisible.
When you get the need to flirt you do your worst

You just don't care how much it hurts.

I can never reach you on the phone
it rings and rings
But I know you're home.
It may be naive but I just want to believe I'm the only one.
I tell myself lies and give you alibies

Knowing your promises you'll never keep
like the merry go round

I'm going up
I'm going down
I'm on a dead end street.

Invisible just like my love
I feel like I'm invisible.
You treat me like I'm not really there
and you don't really care.
I know this romance
it ain't going nowhere.
Although I know it's not a lot
don't want to lose whatever we got.
I keep hanging on knowing I can't win
'Cause it's too hard start over again.
Invisible - I feel like I'm invisible...
Invisible just like my love.
