I won't forget you.

I know that I won't forget you
For I've loved you too much for too long
Though you don't want me now
I'll still love you
'til the breath in my body has gone

That's how it is with me
And you'll always be
The only love I ever knew
I'll forget many things in my life time
But my darling I won't forget you

That's how it is with me
And you'll always be
The only love I ever knew
I'll forget many things in my life time
But my darling I won't forget you.
