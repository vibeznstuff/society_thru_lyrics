As we walk through the
Corridor of creation
We see lands divide
Nation against nation
Like comets they collide
And we pray
We pray for the unseen
To be seen by the eyes of man
When heaven and earth are hand in hand
Thy will be done
Damn, get set for damage
Prepare the soul
To control and manage
Cut the groove
Make it rough like a chainsaw
Inject a beat eat meat like carnivore
Trumpets sound
And wrath pours down
Angels dance to the new groove in town
Clouds part
Sky opens wide
No place to run, no place to hide
Love rain down on me
Don't want to see it
Just wanna feel it
Love knows no boundary
Gotta believe it
And you'll receive it

Love - let it rain 
Love

Tribes 144 on the mount
Like an exodus to the final count
Music is blasting, silence everlasting
The call of the cosmos got the
Planets dancing, 2 send a new wibe
New ray new day
A spiritual experience
Is gonna come you way
A vision a vibe with a touch too tender
Your love to the lord
Now it's time to surrender
Love rain down on me
Don't want to see it
Just wanna feel it
Love knows no boundary
Gotta believe it
And you'll receive it
Let it rain 
Love - let it rain
