Count to ten then relax for a while 
Simmer down and regain control 
How you are sends shivers to spines 
We sit here and hope that is passes by 
And one day it will be fine 
So what if you turn your back 
If talking's a waste of our time you would leave us only the more upset 
Because that's what you get
Fall in line and remember your place 
Stand up straight don't forget the time 
How the trials never taught you a thing
Its meaning is lost on ears shut tight 
And one day it will be fine
So what if you turn your back
If talking's a waste of our time 
You would leave us only the more upset because that's what you get 
I think you should know we've restored our faith
As that was the right thing to do I think you should know as that was the
Right thing to do.
