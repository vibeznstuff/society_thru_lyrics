Don't look back into the sun
Now you know that your time has come
And they said it would never come for you

Oh my friend you haven't changed
Your're looking rough and living strange
I know you got a taste for it too

And they'll never forgive you but they wont let you go, oh no
She'll never forgive you but she won't let you go, oh no

Don't look back into the sun
Where you've cast your plans and you're on the run
And all that lies you said, huh did you say?

But then they played that song at the death disco
It starts fast but it ends so slow
And all the time it just reminded me of you

And they'll never forgive you but they wont let you go, oh no
She'll never forgive you but she wont let you go, oh no

Don't look back into the sun
Don't look back into the sun
Don't look back into the sun
Don't look back into the sun

And they'll never forgive you but they wont let you go, let me go
She'll never forgive you but she wont let you go, oh no

Don't look back into the sun
Don't look back into the sun
Don't look back into the sun
Don't look back into the sun
Don't look back into the sun
