You know our love was meant to be
The kind of love that lasts forever
And I want you here with me
From tonight until the end of time

You should know,
Everywhere I go
Always on my mind,
In my heart
In my soul

Baby


You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration
Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me sayin'
No one needs you more than I need you

And I know, yes I know that it's plain to see
We're so in love when we're together
Now I know that I need you here with me
From tonight until the end of time

You should know,
Everywhere I go
Always on my mind,
You're in my heart
In my soul
