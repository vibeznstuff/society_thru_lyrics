You noble diggers all stand up now, stand up now
You noble diggers all stand up now
The wasteland to maintain seeing cavaliers by name
Your digging does maintain and persons all defame
Stand up now, stand up now

Your houses they pull down stand up now, stand up now
Your houses they pull down, stand up now
Your houses they pull down to fright your men in town
But the gentry must come down and the poor shall wear the crown
Stand up now, diggers all

With spades and hoes and plows stand up now, stand up now
With spades and hoes and plows, stand up now
Your freedom to uphold seeing cavaliers are bold
To kill you if they could and rights from you to hold
Stand up now, diggers all

The gentry are all round stand up now, stand up now
The gentry are all round stand up now
The gentry are all round on each side they are found
Their wisdom's so profound to cheat us of our ground
Stand up now stand up now

The lawyers they conjoin stand up now stand up now
The lawyers they conjoin stand up now
To arrest you they advise, such fury they devise, the devil in them lies
And hath blinded both their eyes
Stand up now, stand up now

The clergy they come in stand up now, stand up now
The clergy they come in stand up now
The clergy they come in and say it is a sin
That we should now begin our freedom for to win
Stand up now diggers all

'Gainst lawyers and 'gainst priests stand up now stand up now
'Gainst lawyers and 'gainst priests stand up now
For tyrants they are both, even flat against their oath
To grant us they are loathe free meat and drink and cloth
Stand up now diggers all

The club is all their law, stand up now stand up now
The club is all their law, stand up now
The club is all their law, to keep all men in awe
That they no vision saw to maintain such a law
Stand up now diggers all
