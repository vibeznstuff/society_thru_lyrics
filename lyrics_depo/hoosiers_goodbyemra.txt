Goodbye Mr. A

There's a hole in your logic,
You who know all the answers (oh-oh-oh-oh)
You claim science ain't magic (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And expect me to buy it

Goodbye Mr. A,
You promised you would love us, but you knew too much,
Goodbye Mr. A,
You had all the answers but no human touch,
If life is subtraction,
Your number is up,
Your love is a fraction,
It's not adding up

So busy showing me where I'm wrong,
You forgot to switch your feelings on, (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
So, so superior, are you not,
You love a little bit but you forgot

Goodbye Mr. A,
You promised you would love us, but you knew too much,
Goodbye Mr. A,
You had all the answers but no human touch,
If life is subtraction,
Your number is up,
Your love is a fraction,
It's not adding up

Goodbye Mr. A
Goodbye Mr. A

Goodbye Mr. A,
The world was full of fun until you opened my eyes,
Goodbye Mr. A,
Wish you hadn't pulled my mind and killed the surprise,

Goodbye Mr. A,
You promised you would love us, but you knew too much,
Goodbye Mr. A
You had all the answers but no human touch.
Your life is subtraction,
Your number is up,
Your love is a fraction,
It's not adding up
