It’s an addiction such an eruption
Sound is my remedy feeding me energy
Music is all I need


Baby, I just wanna daaaaaaance
I don’t really caaaaaaare
I just wanna daaaaaaance
I don’t really care care care (feel it in the air yeah)


She’s been a crazy dita disco diva and you wonder
Who’s that chick? Who’s that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who’s that chick? Who’s that chick?
Who’s that chick? Who’s that chick?
Who’s that chick? Who’s that chick?


Back on the dancefloor bad enough to take me home
Bass kicking so hard blazing through my beating heart
French kissin on the floor, heart is beating hardcore
Everybody's getting a little tipsy off the crazy Goose
This will end up on the news


Baby, I just wanna daaaaaaance
I don’t really caaaaaaare
I just wanna daaaaaaance
I don’t really care care care (feel it in the air yeah)


She’s been a crazy dita disco diva and you wonder
Who’s that chick? Who’s that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who’s that chick? Who’s that chick?

My heart is a dancer beating like a disco drum
Oh, oh oh, oohh wohh, oh oh

Ultra sensual the night has got me love sprung

Beating like a disco drum
Beating like a disco drum
