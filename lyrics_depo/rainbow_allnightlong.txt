You're walking up with your eyes on me
It's looking good but I just don't know
I need a girl who can keep her head
All night long
You didn't came just to see the show
I guess you know what you wanna see
The way you smile lets me know
I can't go wrong
I wanna touch you
I wanna feel you
I wanna make you mine

I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long
I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long

I saw you standing down by the stage
Your black stockings and you see - through dress
Your mouth is open but I don't wanna hear you
Say goodnight
You're sort of young but you're over age
I don't care 'cause I like your style
I don't know about your brain but
You look all right
I wanna touch you
I wanna feel you
I wanna make you mine

I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long
I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long

Your mind is dirty but your hands are clean
You show no class but your legs are long
I know I can't stand another night
On my own
Hey girl would you like some wine
What's your name are you by yourself
Are you the one what do you say
Can I take you home
I wanna touch you
I wanna feel you
I wanna make you mine

I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long
I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long
