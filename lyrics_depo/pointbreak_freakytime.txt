'Coz if your looking for a freaky time, freaky time baby
You can always count on me, I'll be waiting
If your looking for a freaky time, freaky time, baby
You can always count on me, Yeah

I wanna be the one you come home to
I wanna be everything you need
Come on and lay your lips on mine
I wanna be the one to set you free
Come on and pull my body close
I wanna lie you on the floor
Come on and lay your lips on mine
And let our bodies work for more



B. U. M and P. G. R. I. N. D
Bump and Grind, Just be mine tonight



So baby bring your aah over here just for a second
You're looking at me I reckon you're checkin'
Not respecting just what my intentions are
You want me all the way up, I want you half way down
I'm gonna lay down naked make you feel hotty
Every curve every swerve all over your body
Will not go undiscovered by the end of the night
Is a promise I will make so honey turn of the light




'Coz if your looking for a freaky time, freaky time baby
You can always count on me, Yeah
