(Slow it down slow, slow, slow, slow)
Ooh

Calm down take it easy
Take a break a rest
Before it's too late
Take the weight off ya chest
Because you're lovin' it 2 fast
2 fast, 2 fast
If this is ya tempo
Let go real fast
'Cause I ain't in np hurry

2 get nowhere - no don't move to fast
Take a little more care
'Cause I'm here, for your needs dear
Always around
So let us take this love of ours
And slow it down

Slow it down
Yeah don't move it so fast
Slow it down
Ooh 'cause the longer it lasts
Slow it down
Yeah let your heart beat with mine
Slow it down
Ooh let's take our time

Hush there ain't no rush
Nothing can compare to a cold, cold touch
Let the rhythm of our hearts
Keep the beat
Let the passion and desire
Fire the heat - 'cause if I love 2 fast
I ain't gonna last
Slow it down
Is all I ask
'Cause the slower the better
The better the feel
Rock 2 my rhythm
'Cause my rhythm girl is real

Slow it down
Yeah don't move it so fast
Slow it down
Ooh 'cause the longer it lasts
Slow it down
Yeah let your heart beat with mine
Slow it down
Ooh let's take our time

Sittin' on ya bed in ya head
U look alone
Let my love inside
My heart become your home
Let your spirit roam in the land of the free
Where our vibrations
Blend in blinding unity
Where the colours of the rainbow
Are up there in full flow
Come on baby I wanna make love
No I'll never let you go

Slow it down
Yeah don't move it so fast
Slow it down
Ooh 'cause the longer it lasts
Slow it down
Yeah let your heart beat with mine
Slow it down
Ooh let's take our time

Slow it down
Yeah you're moving too fast
Slow it down
Yeah if you want it to last
Slow it down
Yeah let your heart beat with mine
Slow it down
Ooh baby let's take our time...
