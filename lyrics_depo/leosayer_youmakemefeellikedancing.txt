You've got a cute way of talking
You got the better of me
Just snap your fingers and I'm walking
Like a dog hanging on your lead
I'm in a spin you know
Shaking on string you know

You make me feel like dancing
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancing
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make feel like dancing
I feel like dancing
Dancing, dance the night away
I feel like dancing, dancing, aaaah

Quarter to four in the morning
I ain't feeling tired no, no, no, no, no
Just hold me tight and leave on the light
'Cause I don't want to go home
You put a spell on me
I'm right where you want me to be

You make me feel like dancing
I gonna to dance the night away
You make me feel like dancing
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make feel like dancing
I feel like dancing, dancing
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing, dancing
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing, dancing
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing, dancing

And if you'll let me stay
We'll dance our lives away
You make me feel like dancing
I want to dance my life away
You make me feel like dancing
I'm want to dance my life away
You make feel like dancing
I'm want to dance my life away
You make feel like dancing
I'm want to dance my life away
