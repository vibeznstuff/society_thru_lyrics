East, west, over the ocean
Perpetual motion, traveling around
No rest, singing and playing
Night out and day in, doing the rounds
What a great life it must seem
(What a great life it must seem)

Swell joints, everything classy
Nothing that's passé, only the best
Lush girls ogling and eyeing
Crying and sighing, this is success
What a great life it must seem
(What a great life it must seem)

But when I hear young voices singing out
The bells at home come ringing out
When I think all alone
When I think of my home

Mom, dad, all 'round the fire
In festive attire, keeping the day
Aunts, kids, all the relations
Congratulations, this is success
What a great life it must seem
(What a great life it must seem)

But when I hear young voices singin' out
The bells at home start ringing out
When I feel all alone
Then I long for my home
