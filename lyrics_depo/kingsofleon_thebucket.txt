I'll be the one to show you the way
You'll be the one to always complain
3 in the morning come a bang bang bang
All out of fags and I just can't wait
Cancel the thing that I said I'd do
I don't feel comfortable talking to you
Unless you got the zipper fixed on my shoe,
Then I'll be in the lobby drinking for two

18, balding, star, Golden, fallen, heart

Look at the shaky's whats with the blush
Fresh off the plane in my fuzzy rush
Everyones gathered to idolize me,
I hate the way you talk your Japanese scream
It's been too long since I left the shed,
You kick the bucket and I'll swing my legs
Always remember the pact that we made,
Too young to die but old is the grave

I'm a gonna show the way
