I was high and dry
Don't ask me why
We took the wrong turn that day
Out on that long lonely highway.
The river was pounding below
And how we crashed, I'll never know
But suddenly I can't swim
So this is drowning...

Suddenly I'm in too deep
to ever get out
I gave you my heart and my soul to keep
Don't give me your doubts
I'm over my head
and it's scaring me so...

I'm in too deep
I'm in too deep

Thanks for the crash course
That ride upon your noble horse
Well we jumped the fence that day
and rode so far away...
Will I forever roam?
I only want to come home
So won't you throw me a line?
I think it's really time...

Suddenly I'm in too deep
to ever get out
I gave you my heart and soul to keep
Don't give me your doubts
I'm over my head
and it's scaring me so...

So have a little faith baby in where we're going to
Don't ask me where
You know I just can't tell you
All I know is I'm swept away
taken by this undertow
Ooh, waves are crashing in
Baby, baby don't let me go, 'cos...

I'm in too deep
I'm in too deep
I'm in too deep
I'm in too deep
