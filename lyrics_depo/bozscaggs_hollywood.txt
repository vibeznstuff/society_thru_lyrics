The way you read the crowd
The way you make them pay
You stepped in and did the scene a whole new way
No one would resist you now
And even if they could
Hollywood just never had it quite this good

I see your name in lights
I see them standing in line
They send the cards and the wine
Broadway here she comes
You should be a natural

(Camera action do it again)
Ooh anyway I gotta do it
(What a reaction do it again)
Yeah I'm gonna make you a star
(Camera action do it again)
Ooh anyway I gotta do it
(What a reaction do it again)
To get you this part

No one had to tell you what your smile was for
You sure there's not an uncle name of Barrymore
Now she did this and she did that
You are the latest talk
Now there lining up for you around the block

Throwing roses
And Holy Moses
Even the Times say
Sparks fell from the skies
That gets you immortalized

(Camera action do it again)
Oh anyway I gotta do it
(What a reaction do it again)
Yeah I'm gonna make you a star
(Camera action do it again)
Ooh anyway I gotta do it
(What a reaction do it again)
To get you this part

They gave you 5 stars
They're sending big cars
And Sunset Boulevard
Will never be the same
You give it a brand new name

(Camera action do it again)
Oh anyway I gotta do it
(What a reaction do it again)
Yeah I'm gonna make you a star
(Camera action do it again)
Ooh anyway I gotta do it
(What a reaction do it again)
To get you this part

(Camera action do it again)
Oooh anyway I gotta do it
(What a reaction do it again)
To get you this part
(Camera action do it again)
(What a reaction do it again)
Ooooh... do it again
What a reaction do it again
