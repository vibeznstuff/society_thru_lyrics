She was a true as a verse in King James Bible,
And just as pretty as a sparrow’s song
She was tender as the pedals on a fresh picked flower
And honest as a summer day is long
What a good girl…
She wore innocence around like a new born child
Softest smile you’ve ever seen
All her friends tried to tell her I was too damn wild
I still don’t know what she saw in me
What a good girl

Good girl give me everything I wanted
Her sweet heart has my thumb print on it
Like a careless joker I broke her world
What I give just to turn back time
Get it all I can make her all mine
I want one more time with My Good Girl

She use to like holding hands when we’d go walking
She loved laying all over me
She looked up to the heavens sometimes we when were talking
And tell me bout all her dreams
What a Good girl

Good girl give me everything I wanted
Her sweet heart has my thumb print on it
Like a careless joker I broke her world
What I give just to turn back time
And get it all I can make her all mine
I want one more time with My Good Girl

Such a sweet girl
A Change your whole life kind of girl

Good girl give me everything I wanted
Her sweet heart has my thumb print on it
Like a careless joker I broke her world
What I give just to turn back time
And get it all I can make her all mine
I want one more time with My Good Girl

My Good Girl…
One more try, one more try, one more try….
