When I see you looking so sad and lonely
And I know you're feeling low
I remember you said I was the only
Your one and only where'd that go

You'll come 'round when you're ready
I'll keep on nice and steady
Don't get down don't you worry
Just hang on why the hurry
Take your time make it better
Take it down to the letter
What's gone wrong don't you worry
You'll come 'round why the hurry
You'll come 'round

Can't you see that I won't get tired of waiting
I'll be here 'til you get through
If you find yourself just anticipating
I'm gonna wait and say to you

You'll come 'round when you're ready
I'll keep on nice and steady
Don't get down don't you worry
Just hang on why the hurry
Take your time make it better
Take it down to the letter
What's gone wrong don't you worry
You'll come 'round why the hurry
You'll come 'round



Now you know that I will be there forever
Maybe we can work it out
Don't you think it has to be now or never
We know what it's all about

You'll come 'round when you're ready
I'll keep on nice and steady
Don't get down don't you worry
Just hang on why the hurry
Take your time make it better
Take it down to the letter
What's gone wrong don't you worry
You'll come 'round why the hurry
You'll come 'round
You'll come 'round
You'll come 'round
You'll come 'round
