And I stand
On shaken ground
The earth moves beneath my feet
And I shout “forgive me”
But there’s no God listening
And these walls surround us
Always black and grays I see
And we found this time
On our weakness it will feed

Is this the end of the world?
I cannot bear to watch it burn
But we’re crawling in the dirt
Is this the end of it all?
Well we used to stand so tall
I barely recognize us anymore

I don’t believe
In the things I cannot see
But the sky is dead
And they are coming for me
I shout “forgive me”
But this proves I’m now too weak
And I try to speak
But hope has been taken from me

Is this the end of the world?
I cannot bare to watch it burn
But we’re crawling in the dirt
Is this the end of it all?
Well we used to stand so tall
I barely recognize us anymore

Is this the end of the world?
I cannot bare to watch it burn
But we’re crawling in the dirt
Is this the end of it all?
Well we used to stand so tall
I barely recognize us anymore

Is this the end of the world?
Is this the end of the world?
Is this the end of the world?
Is this the end?
Is this the end of the world?
