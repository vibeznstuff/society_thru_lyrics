There was a man, a lonely man
Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared that went unshared
Until it died within his silence


And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him takes him down
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love, it always ends the same
And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

A little hope goes up in smoke
Just how it goes, goes without saying
There was a man, a lonely man
Who would command the hand he's playing
