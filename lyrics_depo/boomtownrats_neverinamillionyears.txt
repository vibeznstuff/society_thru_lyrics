I'll tear down the sky
Don't stop now
No never in a million years

I'd spit in their eye
Don't stop now
But I won't be a volunteer

And now
I'm always dreaming of dreams
That lie in state
Waiting for me to wake
And make
A life for them
I know I'll never let
Those self-defeating fears
Spoil those golden years
These days that pass us by
So slow

And now
I always wander
Through fields that never stood
Can't see the trees for the wood
Or maybe - yes I could
Oh no

I'll tear down the sky
Don't stop now
No never in a million years
