This is a journey into the past, the present, and the future
Now close your eyes and join the trip
It's 6am in the morning, and we find ourselves somewhere in England

Welcome Posse!
We're kick it up!

Once again we have the plan
Driving you wild as good as we can
Don't stop us now, we're gonna make you move
Raving outside to the passionate groove

So I wanna check the microphone, I wanna check the microphone
I wanna check, I wanna check
The Rick, the Ferris, and MC H.P. Scooter!
Back in the UK

Yes!
C'mon!

Somewhere is England, banging the bass
Join our trip to this weird place
Back to nature, where we can be
Faster harder, loud and free

I wanna check the microphone, I wanna check the microphone
I wanna check, I wanna check
The Rick, the Ferris, and MC H.P. Scooter!
Back in the UK

Bass!

We started in 1994! In 1996, we're still on the case
Hold tight crew! Together, no one can stop us now!

So I wanna check the microphone, I wanna check the microphone
I wanna check, I wanna check
The bird, the tree, the cow, the sea,
The Rick, the Ferris and MC H.P.Â !
