Now there's a lifestyle
With painted lips
Now there's a lifestyle
Everybody wants it
But it don't exist
And I said shame...

In the dancehalls and the cinema
Shame
On the TV and the media
Shame
We loved you

Now there's a lifestyle
With fashion chic
Now there's a lifestyle
Everybody in it wants
To be elite
And I said
'You with yer brand new shoes and
You with yer greasy hair and
You with yer mother's pride and poetry
Don't you want to feel the shame?"...

In the dancehalls
Can't you feel the shame?
And the TV
Can't you feel the shame?
We loved you...
Shame
In the dancehalls and the cinema
Shame
On the TV and the media
Shame
We loved you
At the Lido and the opera
Shame
At the races
And the theatre
Shame
We loved you.
And they said all we need is love
All we need is love
With the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.
Day after day
Day after day.
