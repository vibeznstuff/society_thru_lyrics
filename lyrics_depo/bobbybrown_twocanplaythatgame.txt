drop it

Stay with me
But if you want to leave
Take your things
Forget all about me
Tell me why you fail to realise
That you might not ever get another try

Girl think
about it before you leave
Bobby's got a bran' new swing
If you wanna do your own thing 
I hear what your sayin'
Two can play that game

Your playin'
(Play that game)
Two can play that game
(play that game)
Two can play that game 
(play that game)
Two
(play that game)

Lately you've been acting mighty strange
To me it seems you attitude has changed
When suddenly you just don't seem the same
Insted of playin' all those silly games

Girl think
about it before you leave
Bobby's got a bran' new swing
If you wanna do your own thing
I hear what your sayin'
Two can play that game

Your playin'
(Play that Game)
Two can play that game
(play that game)

Two can Play that game

Girl think
about it before you leave
Bobby's got a bran' new swing
If you wanna do your own thing
I hear what your sayin'
Two can play that game

Your Playin'
(Play that game)
Two can play that game
(Play That Game)
Two can play that game
(play that Game)
Two
(Play that game)

Lately you've been up to mighty strange
To me it seems your attitude has changed
And suddenly you just don't seem the same
Instead of playin' all those silly games

Girl think
about it before you leave
Bobby's got a bran' new swing
If you wanna do your own thing
I hear what your sayin'
Two can play that game

Your playin'
(play that game)
Two can play that game
(Play that game)
No no no no no no no
I said two
(Play That game)
Two

Whoo I Said two
(Play that game)
Two can play that game

No no no no no no no
