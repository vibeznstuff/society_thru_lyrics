Water it flows
On deserts you have made
The surface breaks
Breaks like the bones
Your darkness has claimed
There's hell to pay

Awake me
Don't break me

From down on the dirt
To under mountain tops
Where our life stops
And I've been a fool
For more than half my life
I've tried to hide

Awake me
Don't break me

Don't leave it to long
Don't leave it to long

Oh all the birds are falling to the ground
All the trees are growing upside down
We're all holding onto something
Holding onto someone else's hand
