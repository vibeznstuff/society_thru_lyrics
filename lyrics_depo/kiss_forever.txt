I gotta tell you what I'm feelin' inside, I could lie to myself, but it's true
There's no denying when I look in your eyes, girl I'm out of my head over you
I lived so long believin' all love is blind
But everything about you is tellin' me this time


It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever, until my life is thru, girl I'll be lovin' you forever

I hear the echo of a promise I made
When you're strong you can stand on your own
But those words grow distant as I look at your face
No, I don't wanna go it alone
I never thought I'd lay my heart on the line
But everything about you is tellin' me this time

 - yeah!

I see my future when I look in your eyes
It took your love to make my heart come alive
Cos I lived my life believin' all love is blind
But everything about you is tellin' me this time
