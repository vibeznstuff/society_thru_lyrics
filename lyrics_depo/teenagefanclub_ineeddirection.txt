I used to feel fine 
you were to be mine 
I need direction 
to take me to you 

I've asked the sunshine 
shadowed the skyline 
I need direction 
to take me to you 

I get brainwaves 
I get visions 
slow reaction 
superstition 

I need the ways and means to get through 
I need an open heart to look to 
nobody sees the same way I do 
I need direction to get through 

followed the ley lines 
the faded out road signs 
I need direction 
to take me to you 

I get spellbound 
I get visions 
slow advances 
indecision 

I need the ways and means to get through 
I need an open heart to look to 
nobody sees the same way I do 
I need direction to get through 

Honest I'd feel fine 
if you were to be mine 
I need direction to take me to you
