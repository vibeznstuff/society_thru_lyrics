He sees her at the same time every night
At the Mexican discotheque
She gives him French kisses
He gives her French cigarettes
They sit at the same table every time
The lights are low
But their eyes shine
Just digging the music from those sweet soul bands
She keeps him outta fights
Holds on to his hand
He whispers slowly "Tonight's the night"
Months of planning so it's gotta be right
Under the table her bag is bursting at the seams
She made sure to bring everything
Moonlighting
They're leaving everything
Moonlighting
They're losing all their friends
Moonlighting
It's the only way
It's frightening
But it means they'll stay
Together
They're gonna make it together
His blue Morris van is parked in an alley
Just by Montague Street
His friend Eddie he did the re-spray
So he couldn't drive it all last week
And it cost most of the money that he had saved up
To pay Eddie's receipt
But he figures it's worth it 'cos the disguise is a must
When they go missing they're gonna look for the van first
She whispers slowly "It'll be alright
I took some cash from my building society
And my monthly cheque came in just right"
If only they knew they were giving it away
Moonlighting
They're leaving everything
Moonlighting
They're losing all their friends
Moonlighting
It's the only way
It's frightening
But it means they'll stay
Together
They're gonna make it together
9:15 Monday morning at the printing works
The boss notices someone's not clocked in
And the water department of the council offices has a message
That Mrs. Park's daughter is missing
Meanwhile the Carlisle turn-off of the M6 Motorway
Drinking cold black coffee eating hot cup-cakes
She stares at him with his beard un-shaved
Wonders at his powers of staying awake
He whispers slowly "You did just fine"
They shared the driving all through the night
She laughs "My mother will have lost her mind
We're only ten miles to Gretna
They're three hundred behind"
Moonlighting
They're leaving everything
Moonlighting
They're losing all their friends
Moonlighting
It's the only way
It's frightening
But it means they'll stay
Together
They're gonna make it together
Moonlighting
They're leaving everything
Moonlighting
They're losing all their friends
Moonlighting
It's the only way
It's frightening
But it means they'll stay
Together
They're gonna make it together
