I'm going back to a time when we owned this town
Down Powdermill lane and the Battle grounds
We were friends and lovers and clueless clowns

I didn't know I was finding out how I'd be torn from you
When we talked about things we were gonna do
We were wide-eyed dreamers and wiser too

We'd go down to the rides on east parade,
By the lights of the palace arcade
And watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café

I'm begging you for some sign, but you've still got nothing to say
Don't turn your back on me, don't walk away
I'm a better man now than I was that day.

Let's go down to the rides on east parade,
By the lights of the palace arcade
And watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café

Let's go down to the bandstand on the pier
Watch the drunks and the lovers appear
To take turns as the stars of the Sovereign Light Café

I wheel my bike off the train,
Up the North Trade Road.
And look for you on Marley Lane
In every building, in every street sign
Oh, why did we ever go
So far from home?

Well, you got nothing to hide, you can't change who you really are,
You can get a big house and a faster car
You can run away, boy, but you won't go far.

Let's go down to the rides on east parade,
By the lights of the palace arcade
And watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café

Let's go down to the bandstand on the pier
Watch the drunks and the lovers appear
To take turns as the stars of the Sovereign Light Café

Sha la la la la la la dee lay, yeah,
I'm going where the people know my name
