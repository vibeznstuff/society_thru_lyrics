Go to a cash machine 
To get a ticket home 
Message on the screen 
Says don't make plans, you're broke 
No, no this can't be right 
I know that time is tight 
I've only just been paid 
Three weeks five days, til I'm seen 
Right... 
No... 
I scratch a living, it ain't easy 
You know it's a drag 
I'm always paying, never make it 
But you can't look back 
I wonder if I'll ever get 
To where I want to be 
Better believe it 
I'm working for the cash machine 

I try to phone a friend 
My credit's in the red 
I try to skip the fare 
Ticket inspector's there 
No no, this can't be right 
I live an honest life 
It seems like sometimes 
You don't cross the line 
You don't get 
By... 
No... 

I scratch a living, it ain't easy 
You know it's a drag 
I'm always paying, never make it 
But you can't look back 
I wonder if I'll ever get 
To where I want to be 
Better believe it 
Yeah... 

What am I gonna do 
My girlfriend's test turned blue 
We tried to play it safe 
That night we could not wait 
No no, this can't be right 
She said it would be alright 
I can't afford to be a daddy 
So I leave tonight... 
No... 

I scratch a living, it ain't easy

Better believe it 
I'm working for the cash machine 
Cash machine 
Cash machine ...
