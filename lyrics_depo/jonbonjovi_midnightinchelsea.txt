The kids round here look just like sticks 
They trade old licks with a beat up six 
I just smile and catch the groove 

Gothic girls all dressed in black 
Serious as heart attacks 
Takes a little bit of getting used to 

The old man with the whisky stains 
Lost the night, forgot his name 
His poor wife will sleep alone again 
And it ain't hard to understand 
Why she's holding onto her own hand 

It's midnight in Chelsea (shalalala, shalala) 
Midnight in Chelsea (shalalala, shalala) 
No one's asking me for favors (shalalala, shalala) 
No one's looking for a savior 
They're too busy ... saving me (shalalala, shalala) 

I've seen a lone sloane ranger drive 
Seems her chauffeur took a dive 
And sold her secrets to the Sun 

And later in a magazine 
I finally figured what it means 
To be a saint, not a queen 

Two lustful lovers catch a spark 
Chase their shadows in the dark 
Someone's getting off tonight 

A big red bus that's packed so tight disappears in a trail of light 
Somewhere someone's dreaming baby it's alright.... 

It's midnight in Chelsea (shalalala, shalala) 
Midnight in Chelsea (shalalala, shalala) 
No one's asking me for favors (shalalala, shalala) 
No one's looking for a savior 
They're too busy saving me (shalalala, shalala) 
(shalalala, shalala) 
Midnight in Chelsea (shalalala, shalala) 
No one's pinned their dreams on me 
No one's asking me to bleed 
I'm the man I wanna be 
When Chelsea girls sing 
Shalalala, shalalala 
Shalalala, shalala, oh 
Shalalala, shalalala 
Shalalala, shalala, oh, oh ... 

It's morning when I go to sleep 
In the distant dawn a church bell rings 
Another day is coming on 

A baby's born, an old man dies 
Somewhere young lovers kiss good bye 
I leave my soul and just move on 
And wish that I was there to sing this song 



(shalalala, shalala) 
(shalalala, shalala) 
It's midnight in Chelsea (shalalala, shalala) 
Oh, midnight in Chelsea (shalalala, shalala) 
No one's asking me for favors (shalalala, shalala) 
No one's looking for a savior 
They're too busy saving me (shalalala, shalala) 

It's midnight in Chelsea (shalalala, shalala) woh (shalalala, shalala) yeah 
No one's pinned their dreams on me 
No one's asking me to bleed 
I'm the man I wanna be 
The man I wanna be, the man I wanna be (shalalala, shalala) 
Midnight in Chelsea (shalalala, shalala...)
