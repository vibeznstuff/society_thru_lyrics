All I ever wanted was to feel the way you'd feel
All I ever wanted was a chance to make it real
I'm in love with you and I can pull it through

All I ever wanted is a place out by the sun
To watch the world go by and take each day as it comes
All I ever wanted was a chance to catch my breath
To see the world go by and lay my ghosts to rest

Give me a chance to catch my breath
So I can lay my ghosts to rest

So ask me tomorrow what I thought of yesterday
There's so many things that I could not explain
I'm in love with you and I can pull it through

All I ever wanted is a place out by the sun
To watch the world go by and take each day as it comes
All I ever wanted was a chance to catch my breath
To see the world go by and lay my ghosts to rest

Give me a chance to catch my breath
So I can lay my ghosts to rest

All that I ever wanted was a chance to catch my breath
All that I ever wanted was to lay my ghosts to rest
All that I ever wanted was a chance to catch my breath
All that I ever wanted was to lay my ghosts to rest
