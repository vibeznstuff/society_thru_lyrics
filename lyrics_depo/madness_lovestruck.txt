Staggering home the headlights throw a shadow up and upon
Friends and loved ones that have done no wrong
But no longer mean anything to me
Mumbling on into a crystal glass that echoes a song
The enticement invites you along
A path of exterior colour

But came the morning shivering and contorting
To border on the brink for just another sink
Oh take me down for one more round Oh involve me in libation
Stick a rock in my foundation soak me in stagnation
Tackle my translation and I'll take you down
For one last round

Love struck I've fallen for a lamppost given her my utmost
Spilling out my deepest feelings
Now all I want to do is snuggle up to you
A night cap in the early morning dew

Look what have I become?
Distancing myself so far and front
But gazing up I wave the night boat on
For now its heaven in deepest Tottenham

What have I done to deserve this fate?
It's all gone wrong
Even my cab fares been and gone
Now I'm lagging in deepest Tottenham
