The young ones,
Darling we're the young ones,
And young ones shouldn't be afraid.

To live, love
While the flame is strong,
For we won't be the young ones very long.

Tomorrow,
Why wait till tomorrow,
Tomorrow sometimes never comes.
Love, me,
There's a song to be sung
And the best time is to sing while we're young.

Once in every lifetime
Comes a love like this.
I need you and you need me.
Oh my darling can't you see.
Young dreams
Should be dreamed together,
Young hearts shouldn't be afraid.
And some day when the years have flown
Darling, this will teach the young ones of our own.
The young ones
Darling, we're the young ones
The young ones
Darling, we're the young ones.
