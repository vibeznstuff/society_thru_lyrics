You can see there's something in the way
I've tried to show you, my door is open
I don't know how much more I can take
Since you've chosen, to leave me frozen
Am I the only one, who sees what you've become?
Will you drift away?
We're running out of time, two wrongs can make it right
Could I make you stay?

People making choices they can't fake
Sacrifice it all and maybe say


Something extraordinary
Something real (something real)
To fill my days and nights with something
That I can feel (I can feel)
I'm not gonna compromise
Surely you can sympathise?
Say you feel the same


You've wandered down a path I can't explain
Have you seen her? The grass is greener
To let me pass you by would be a shame
If she's your only then why're you lonely?
Cause I'm the only one, who knows the things you've done
I'm so good for you
We're running out of time, two wrongs can make it right
Could I make you do




Just don't say it will be alright
You're not holding yourself in your arms tonight
Don't say it will all be fine
In only a moment you'll say goodbye

I, I, I, I, I, I, I...
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I...

Something extraordinary
Something real
To fill my days and nights with something
That I can feel (I can feel)

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh,
I, I, I, I, I, I, I...
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I...

Something extraordinary
Something real
To fill my days and nights with something
That I can feel (I can feel)
