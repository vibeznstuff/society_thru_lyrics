Where to escape to
Where to be free
No humanity ina dis reality
You no see seh man a loose dem life
You no see di whole a we a live one lie
I know its never fair to di people
When will it ever be?
When inequality is the way we profitin
Dats the way you keep
The youts dem poor
And di only reason is
To tek some more
Well are we gonna wait around
Or a we gonna make a sound

Time to find a common ground
Against the things dat bring us down
Cause jah jah bless I with the brightest light

Deh ya so fi truths an rights
An until the day dat my soul takes flight

Have you eva seen a smile on the face
Of a child dat find a way

Out a de place dem reside
An keep dem mind

Caught in a state a denial
Dat tell dem no try you will fail
Is a lie

When all di youts need
Is a chance not a blame

Some care some kindness
Reach far you surprise

Sometimes support
Change up the course of a life
More time man jus wan
Get a piece a di pie

Cyan sleep it off
Den wake up next morning
An simply repeat di day
Oh yes
So whosoeva been exalted
Ima need you to lead the way

Cah jah jah bless I with the brightest light
An I a shine it pon di yout dem plight
Oh we deh ya so fi truths an rights
Come ya so fi truths an rights

An until the day dat my soul takes flight

Cah we deh ya so fi truth and rights
Come ya so fi truths an rights

Hey
Who willing fi go mek dat step
Who a go vote fi love when di election set
Whose ex will be the one
To represent what's next
Or is it jus to get dat cheque
Or the dollars weh affect man sense
Is dat what is di intention den
You get the message to a pressbox sent
Decide di answer fi di question dem
Raise you hand up its the next anthem
My friend

Cause jah jah bless I with the brightest light
An I a shine it pon di yout dem plight
Cah we deh ya so fi truths an rights
Deh ya so fi truths an rights
An until the day dat my soul takes flight
Babylon will hear my voice
We de ya so fi truth and rights
De ya so fi truths an rights
