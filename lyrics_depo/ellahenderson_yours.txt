I’ll wear your winter coat, the one you love to wear
So I keep feeling close to what’s beyond compare
The moments waking up, you catch me in your eyes
That beauty on my pillow that holds me in the night

And I would fight my strength to untape my mouth
When I used to be afraid of the words
But with you I’ve learnt just to let it out
Now my heart is ready to burst
Cause I, I feel like I’m ready for love
And I, wanna be your everything and more
And I know every day I say it
But I just want you to be sure
That I am yours

And if I be feeling heavy
You take me from the dark
Your arms they keep me steady
So nothing could fall apart

And I would fight my strength to untape my mouth
When I used to be afraid of the words
But with you I’ve learnt just to let it out
Now my heart is ready to burst
‘Cause I, I feel like I’m ready for love
And I wanna be your everything and more
And I know every day I say it
But I just want you to be sure
That I am yours

That I am yours
