If I can't find the words... 

Waiting for this feeling 
That I'm drowning in to subside 
You make me swim like a beginner 
Like I'm new at life 
All these words don't come easy 
No they always seem to stop 
There is awkward silence yeah 
Anytime we talk 

Oh but I wanna let it in 
I wanna ease all your doubts 
I keep trying to get it out 

But if I can't find the words 
To tell you what I'm feeling 
Baby that don't mean 
It don't mean that I don't feel it 
I'm trying to tell you girl 
But if you don't believe just look and see 
My face says what you mean to me 
When I can't find the words 

I know I can send you flowers 
To try to make my feelings clear 
And girl I could hold you tight for hours 
I wanna tell you what you're trying to hear 

Oh and I wanna let it in 
I wanna ease all your doubts 
I keep trying to get it out 

But if I can't find the words 
To tell you what I'm feeling 
Baby that don't mean 
It don't mean that I don't feel it 
I'm trying to tell you girl 
But if you don't believe just look and see 
My face says what you mean to me 
When I can't find the words 

But I know sometimes I leave you so upset 
Cos I got all these bits and pieces in my head 
I know because I let you struggle with the things I haven't said 

When I can't find the words 
When I can't find the words 
When I, when I, when I can't find the words 
I wanna ease all your doubts (ease all your doubts)
I keep trying to get it out 

But if I can't find the words 
To tell you what I'm feeling 
But baby that don't mean 
It don't mean that I don't feel it 
I'm trying to tell you girl 
But if you don't believe just look and see 

My smile says what you mean to me 
When I can't find the words 
If I can't find the words
