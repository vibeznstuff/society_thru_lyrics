Once in a house on a hill 
A boy got angry 
He broke into my heart 

For a day and a night 
I stayed beside him 
Until I had no hope 

So I came down the hill 
Of course I was hurt 
But then I started to think 

It shouldn't hurt me to be free 
It's what I really need 
To pull myself together 
But if it's so good being free 
Would you mind telling me 
Why I don't know what to do with myself 

There's a bar by the dock 
Where I found myself 
Drinking with this man 
He offered me a cigarette 
And I accepted 
'Cause it's been a very long time 
As it burned 'till the end 
I thought of the boy 
No one could ever forget 

It shouldn't hurt me to be free 
It's what I really need 
To pull myself together 
But if it's so good being free 
Would you mind telling me 
Why I don't know what to do with myself 

To pull myself together 
But if it's so good being free 
Would you mind telling me 
Why I don't know what to do with myself 

To pull myself together 
But if it's so good being free 
Would you mind telling me 
Why I don't know what to do with myself
