Women of a certain age
They learn to rely and judge all his responses
Having played the mating game
She's doesn't waste time all that she wants is
Really honest emotion
Ones he can't help but show
Though I hardly know your name
I know about love and I know

I don't wanna lose you
I don't even wanna say good-bye
I just wanna hold on this true love true love

Women who have made mistakes
Are a little afraid
They don't like taking chances
She will play the waiting game
She's never impressed by the manly advances
I know I've just met you
Maybe I should know better
But when you look at me that way
There's something inside that's so right

I don't wanna lose you
I don't even wanna say good-bye
I just wanna hold on this true love true love
I don't wanna lose you
And I always wanna feel this way
'Cause everytime I'm with you
I feel true love true love true love

Tell me you're real
You're not pretending
Let's make a deal 'cause my heart's depending on you

I don't wanna lose you
I don't even wanna say good-bye
I just wanna hold on to this true love true love
I don't wanna lose you
And I always wanna feel this way
'Cause everytime I'm with you
I feel your true love true love
I don't wanna lose you
I don't even wanna say good-bye
I just wanna hold on to this true love true love
I don't wanna lose you
And I always wanna feel this way
'Cause everytime I'm with you
I feel your true love true love
