When we meet, I listen to your heartbeat
I can hear the rhythm and the tone
Every time I listen to my heart
It's like a cartwheel in my head, but my legs are made of lead

Your heartbeat song
It's good, but it's not the one
We're singing out of tune
But I still want to sing with you

When we speak, I find it hard to think straight
Especially when there's no one else around
When we touch, it's impossible to concentrate
Bright lights everywhere like I'm floating in the air

Your heartbeat song
It's good, but it's not the one
We're singing out of tune
But I still want to sing with you

Your heartbeat song
It's good, but it's not the one
We're singing out of tune
But I still want to sing with you
But I still want to sing with you

If you care, we can share sometime
If we spare ourselves tonight

When we meet, I listen to your heartbeat
I can hear the rhythm and the tone
Every time I listen to my heart
It's like a cartwheel in my head, but my legs are made of lead

When we speak, I find it hard to think straight
Especially when there's no one else around
When we touch, it's impossible to concentrate
Bright lights everywhere like I'm floating in the air

Your heartbeat song
It's good, but it's not the one
We're singing out of tune
But I still want to sing with you

Your heartbeat song
It's good, but it's not the one
We're singing out of tune
But I still want to sing with you

Still want to sing with you
Still want to sing with you
I still want to sing with you
