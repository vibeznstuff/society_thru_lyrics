You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down


You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
Flo Ridaâ€™


Hey!


Walk out the house with my swagger
Hop in the whip yo I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, out of control
Just like my mind where I'm going
No women, no shorties, no nothing my clothes
No stomping on my Perreli's on froze
Unlike my jewelry that's always on cold
I know the storm is coming
My pockets keep telling me its gonna shower
Call up my homies it's on and poppin' tonight cause it's meant to be ours
We keep a fade away shot cause we balling this platinum Patron every hour
Look momma I owe you just like the flowers
Girl you the truth with all that goody sour
GO!



You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down


From the top of the pole, I watch her go down
She got me throwing my money around
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found
It's going down down
From the top of the pole, I watch her go down
She got me throwing my money around
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found
It's going down down
Hey!


Shorty must know I'm the man
My money love her like a number one fan
Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my fans, my Benjamin Franklin's
A couple of grands, I got rubber bands, my paper planes making her dance
Get dirty on like the spot on my hand
We building castles that made out of sand
She's amazin', her fire blazin', hotter than Cajun, girl won't you move a little closer
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage, that body belong on a poster
I'm in a daze, that bottom is waving at me like dammit I told ya
You want a show like a gun out a holster
Tell me whatever and I'll be ya chauffeur
Cause...




I'm spending my money (Aye!)
I'm out of control (Aye!)
Somebody help me
She taking my bank roll
But I'm king of the club (Aye!)
And I'm wearing the crown
Poppin' these bottles
Touching these models
Watching they asses go down down 



You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
