Maybe I'm just crazy
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I don't know how to love but
Maybe I do
Maybe you know more than me but
This much is true
This little heart and brain of mine say
We're through with you

And I wonder does it blow your mind
That I'm leaving you far behind
I wonder does it stop your heart to know
You're not my sunshine anymore

Okay you're pretty
Your face is a work of art
Your smile could light up New York City after dark
Okay you're coverboy pretty
Stamped with a beauty mark
But it's such a pity a boy so pretty
With an ugly heart

Maybe you'll get married
And she will kiss your feet
While I give all my rights away
I won't lose no sleep
Maybe on your honeymoon
You'll think of me
But if you don't won't shed a tear
Yeah I can guarantee

And I wonder does it blow your mind
That I'm leaving you far behind
I wonder does it stop your heart to know
You're not my sunshine anymore

Okay you're pretty
Your face is a work of art
Your smile could light up New York City after dark
Okay you're coverboy pretty
Stamped with a beauty mark
But it's such a pity a boy so pretty
With an ugly heart

Okay you're pretty
Your face is a work of art
Your smile could probably light up New York after dark
Okay you're coverboy pretty
Stamped with a beauty mark
But it's such a pity
A boy so pretty
With an uh- an uh- an ugly heart
An uh an uh an ugly heart

So...

Okay you're pretty
Your face is a work of art
Your smile could light up New York City after dark
Okay you're coverboy pretty
Stamped with a beauty mark
But it's such a pity a boy so pretty
With an ugly heart

Okay you're pretty
Your face is a work of art
Your smile could light up New York City after dark
Okay you're coverboy pretty
Stamped with a beauty mark
But it's such a pity a boy so pretty, so pretty, so pretty
With an ugly heart
