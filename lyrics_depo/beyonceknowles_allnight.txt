I found the truth beneath your lies
And true love never has to hide
Trade your broken wings for mine
I've seen your scars and kissed your crimes

So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya
Give you some time to prove that I can trust ya again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya

All night long...
(All night yeah)

Good love
All night long...
(All night yeah)

Sweet love
All night long...
(All night yeah)

Love
All night long...
(All night yeah)

All I wanna
Be no other
Be together
I remember
Sweet love
All night long...

My love was stronger than your pride
Beyond your darkness I'm your light
You get deep you touch my mind
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes

So many people I know that they just trying to touch you
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya
Give you some time to prove that I can trust ya again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya

All night long...
(All night yeah)

Good love
All night long...
(All night yeah)

Sweet love
All night long...

They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away

Boy nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy

So many people I know that they just trying to touch you
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya
Give you some time to prove that I can trust ya again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya

All night long...
(All night yeah)

Good love
All night long...
(All night yeah)

Sweet love
All night long...
(All night yeah)

Love
All night long...

All I wanna
Be no other
Be together
I remember
Sweet love
All night long...

How I missed you, my love
