Something inside of me
Feels like I've been wanting you forever
There'll never be another century
There's no time to think about the weather

When there's something inside of me
Something inside of me
Something inside of me
And now I can't look back

The invisible invasion
It's like a stranger strangled on the moor
Into the void for now I'm gone
Five in the morning I'll be knocking at your door

With something inside of me
Something inside of me
Something inside of me
And now I can't look back

Oh please don't cut me loose
I know you think that I'm bullet-proof
Can't you see that it's hurting me
What do think I'm supposed to be when 

There's something inside of me
Feels like I've been wanting you forever
There'll never be another century
There's no time to think about the weather

When there's something inside of me
There's something inside of me
Something inside of me
And now I can't look back
