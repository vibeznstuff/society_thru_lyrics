Drawing circles on the window
Then I'm staring at the floor
There are places that we could go
'Cause we've been here before
And I'm losing myself
And I'm feeling a little...
Confused, I need help
I'm outta here

Get out the car honey,
What you said was outta place
Well I guess I'm walking home
With that sad look upon my face
Straight from the heart no worries,
Got a lot of love to make
Can you feel it a little...?
Don't let it go to waste

We're like a long distance conversation
With a two second delay
Talk a lot but we don't listen
And we got so much to say

And I'm losing myself
And I'm feeling a little...
Confused, I need help
I'm outta here

Get out the car honey,
What you said was outta place
Well I guess I'm walking home
With that sad look upon my face
Straight from the heart no worries,
Got a lot of love to make
Can you feel it a little...?
Don't let it go to waste

And I don't want to miss you
Even though we got issues
Yeah I know we can get through
Live for it all, 'cause after the fall comes the high

Get out the car honey,
What you said was outta place
Well I guess I'm walking home
With that sad look upon my face
Straight from the heart no worries,
Got a lot of love to make
Can you feel it a little...?
Don't let it go to waste
Don't let it go to waste
Don't let it go to waste
If you feel it a little
Well don't let us go to waste
