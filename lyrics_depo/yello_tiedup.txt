Gulemo dilemma
Gulemo dilemma
Tie me up, the city heat
Bring the bell, go down the street
Tie me up to the babaumba beat
Try to beat, try to fight
Take me back into the ring tonight
Shake it up, beat down the beat
Shake it up to the babaumba heat
It's the african queen, we got the summer night grand
It's the african queen, the hottest lady in town
It's the african queen, who keeps me on my feet
It's the african queen, the babaumba beat

All you need is love
Take my heart
And hold me tight forever, forever

Bombo-yo, ko ko ko bombo ya
Bombo-yo, ko ko ko bombo ya
Bombo-yo, ko ko ko bombo ya

Ring the bell
Roll down the street
Tie me up into the city heat

Take me guys, keep up the beat
Bring the bell into the city heat

Tied up, tied up
Tied up, tied up
Tied up, tied up
Tied up, tied up
Tied up, tied up
Tied up, tied up
Tied up, tied up
Tied up, tied up

Gulemo dilemma
Got awaaaaaaaaaay

Take me guys, keep up the beat
Bring the bell into the city heat
Got awaaaaaaaaaay eko-ahll-ahhhhhhhhhhhhh

Ring the bell, roll down the street
Tie me up into the city heat

Take me guys, keep up the beat
Bring the bell into the city heat

Take it up, beat on the beat
Shake it up, the babaumba beat
Keep your cool, keep cool your mind
Shift the beat, you're one of a kind

Kick the gong, beef up the beat
Back to hell into the city heat
Hit the bell, roll down the street
Tie me up to the babaumba beat
Take the beat, take the fight
Take me back into the ring tonight

It's the african queen, we got the summer night grand
It's the african queen, the hottest lady in town
It's the african queen, who keeps me on my feet
It's the african queen, the babaumba beat
