If you love it like I love it
And you feel what I feel inside
If you want it like I want it
Then baby let's get it tonight
If you feel it, say hell yeah (hell yeah)
Say hell yeah (hell yeah)
And say hell yeah (hell yeah)
This is love, this is love, this is love


Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
This is love, this is love, this is love




This is love for the beats
Steal it in the streets
Love for the melody, notes on a sheet
The dope crusader, funky terminator
I created me a rocker just so we could rock it later
And the way the beat is knocking
Got me feeling, alright, cause the DJ got me walking on the ceiling (all night)
I got a rocket full of gold, mami's just gold
I filled it up with love and then I watch it explode


If you love it like I love it
And you feel what I feel inside
If you want it like I want it
Then baby let's get it tonight
If you feel it, say hell yeah (hell yeah)
Say hell yeah (hell yeah)
And say hell yeah (hell yeah)
This is love, this is love, this is love


Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
This is love, this is love, this is love


This is love for the bass, and love for the trouble
Love for the orchestra, violincello,
Love for computer beat, hotter than metal
House beat housing, bouncing in the ghetto
We sip till we smashed up, feeling alright
And we rock the ghetto blaster, rocking all night
I sent a rocket to the globe, armor just stole
I filled it up with love and then I watch it explode

Yeah, baby, yeah, alright
Can you feel it?
Good god, yeah, alright


Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
This is love, this is love, this is love

This is love, this is love, this is love
This is love, this is love, this is love
This is love, this is love, this is love
This is love, this is love, this is love

Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
