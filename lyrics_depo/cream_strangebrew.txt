Strange brew -- killin' what's inside of you.

She's a witch of trouble in electric blue.
In her own mad mind she's in love with you,
With you.
Now what you gonna do?
Strange brew -- killin' what's inside of you.

She's some kind of demon messin' in the flue.
If you don't watch out it'll stick to you,
To you.
What kind of fool are you?
Strange brew -- killin' what's inside of you.

On a boat in the middle of a raging sea,
She would make a scene for it all to be
Ignored.
And wouldn't you be bored?
Strange brew -- killin' what's inside of you.

Strange brew, strange brew, strange brew, strange brew.
Strange brew -- killin' what's inside of you.
