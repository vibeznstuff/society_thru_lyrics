Are you ready 
Are you ready
Are you ready

If you're wantin' some action
I've got something for you
A funky style with attraction
A kinda life with a different attitude

You have expensive possessions
Your wildest dreams they all come true
You are the main attraction
People adore the image of you

You're driving fancy cars
And wearin' fancy things
Drippin' with diamonds and gold (the real thing)
Is it much too much
Or is it much too fast
Tell me are you ready
Really really ready for 

Success
It's an attitude
Livin' the lifestyle is getting real buckwild
Success
Hey if you want it
You've just got to let go
Come and get into it
Success

Can you handle the limelight
'cause the press machine
will snap your face and eat your mind too
you need more than a doctor
to help you through the good the bad and the blues
it's a chain reaction
a dimension where you're pumpin' and stompin' the tunes
it may not be everlastin'
but my advice is try success
'cause it might be right for you

You're driving fancy cars

(success) If you need it 
(success) Come and get it 
(success) Oh oh oh

Can you handle bright lights
Parties every Friday night
Limousines club scenes money that keeps rollin' in
Cameras at every block
Gossip that will never stop
That's the lifestyle of success

Tell me tell me tell me
Are you ready tell me tell me
Tell me tell me tell me
(Success) Are you with it tell me tell me
Tell me tell me tell me (success)
Get into it tell me tell me
Tell me tell me tell me (success)
Tell me tell me tell me
Tell me tell me tell me are you ready
