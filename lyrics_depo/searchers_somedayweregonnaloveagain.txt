Someday we're gonna love again
Someday we're gonna love again
When we broke up I still wore a smile
I told myself you'd only gone for a while
But in my heart I grinned, I held up my chin
Because I knew someday we're gonna love again
Someday we're gonna love again
Someday we're gonna love again
Someday we're gonna love again
I didn't worry 'bout it when you left
I knew that I could take care of myself
You wouldn't be gone long and nothin' could go wrong
Because I knew someday we're gonna love again
Someday we're gonna love again
Someday we're gonna love again
Someday we're gonna love again
You just told me that your love hasn't changed
And that's why I'd like to arrange to see you again
I don't know when but I do know that someday we're gonna love again
Someday we're gonna love again
Someday we're gonna love again
Someday we're gonna love again
