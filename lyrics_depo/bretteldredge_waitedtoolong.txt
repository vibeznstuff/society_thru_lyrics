Mmmmm
I got my hands in my pockets cause it's been a cold walk home
I'm still a little shocked that you don't want me anymore
I was so foolish thinkin' you'd be
Happy just sittin' round waitin' on me
It really put me in my place
When you closed the door in my face

And I
I sure spent a lot of time
All makin' up my mind
Once I finally figured out where I belong
I waited too long
Yeah
I guess I waited too long

I could beg, I could cry but it won't change the circumstance
Cause the truth is I should've pulled the trigger when I had the chance
I was looking for something I already had
When I came back for it it was somebody else's
You used to give me all your lovin'
But now you say you've had enough

And I
I sure spent a lot of time
Oh makin' up my mind
Once I finally figured out where I belong
I waited too long
Yeah
I guess I waited too long

Oh waited, I waited

I got my hands in my pockets cause it's been a cold walk home
I'm still a little shocked that you don't want me anymore

And I
Sure spent a lot of time
Oh makin' up my mind
And once I finally figured out where I belong
Yeah once I finally figured out where I belong
I waited too long
Yeah I guess I waited too long
Waited, waited
Oh waited, waited too long
