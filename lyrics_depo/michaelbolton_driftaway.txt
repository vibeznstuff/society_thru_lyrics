Day after day I'm more confused
But I look for the light through the pourin' rain
You know that's a game that I hate to lose
I'm feelin' the strain
Ain't it a shame


Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Beginin' to think that I'm wastin time
And I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
I'm countin' on you to carry me thru



And when my mind is free
You know a melody can move me
And when I'm feelin' blue
The guitars comin' thru to soothe me

Thanks for the joy that you've given me
I want you to know I believe in the song
And rhythm and rhyme and harmony
You helped me along, you're makin' me strong
