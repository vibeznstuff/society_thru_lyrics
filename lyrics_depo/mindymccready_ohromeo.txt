Juliet waits at the border
Of a creek without a corner
Gazes into the dark
Was it the moon or only
Her fear of being lonely
That gave her leave of her heart?
Oh- oh-oh

Oh Romeo (Romeo)
Who would lay down her life? (Romeo)
Swallow the poison, pick up the knife
Maybe I cried (maybe I cried)
Just a teardrop or two (tear or two)
I would not die for you
I would not die for you

Just another romantic depressant
Giving in she becomes obsessive
Maybe this time I'll learn
Life's like a box of matches
Sometimes the whole thing catches
And all you can do is watch it burn
Oh-oh-oh

Oh Romeo (Romeo)
Who would lay down her life? (Romeo)
Swallow the poison, beck of the night
Maybe I cried (maybe I cried)
Just a teardrop or two (tear or two)
I would not die for you
I would not die for you

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

Juliet waits at the border
Contemplates the new world order

Oh Romeo (Romeo)
Who would lay down her life? (Romeo)
Swallow the poison, beck of the night
Maybe I cried (maybe I cried)
Just a teardrop or two (tear or two)
I would not die for you
I would not die for you

I would not die for you
Oh Romeo, oh Romeo, oh Romeo, oh Romeo
