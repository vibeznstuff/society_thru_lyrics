A PRISONER OF YOUR LOVE
ENTANGLED IN YOUR WEB
HOT WHISPERS IN THE NIGHT
I`M CAPTURED BY YOUR SPELL CAPTURED
OH YES I`M TOUCHED BY THIS SHOW OF EMOTION
SHOULD I BE FRACTURED BY YOUR LACK OF DEVOTION
SHOULD I, SHOULD I

OH YOU BETTER BE GOOD TO ME
THAT`S HOW IT`S GOT TO BE NOW
CAUSE I DON`T HAVE NO USE
FOR WHAT YOU LOOSELY CALL THE TRUTH
OH YOU BETTER BE GOOD TO ME
YES YOU BETTER BE GOOD TO ME

AND I THINK IT`S ONLY RIGHT
THAT WE DON`T MEET AT NIGHT
WE STAND FACE TO FACE
AND YOU PRESENT YOUR CASE
AND I KNOW YOU KEEP TELLING ME THAT YOU LOVE ME
AND I REALLY DO WANT TO BELIEVE
BUT DID YOU THINK I`D JUST ACCEPT YOU IN BLIND FAITH
OH SURE BABE ANYTHING TO PLEASE YOU
OH YOU BETTER BE GOOD TO ME

THAT`S HOW IT`S GOT TO BE NOW
CAUSE I DON`T HAVE THE TIME FOR YOUR OVER LOADED LINES
YES YOU BETTER BE GOOD TO ME
YES YOU BETTER BE GOOD TO ME

AND I REALLY DON`T SEE
WHY IT`S SO HARD TO BE
GOOD TO ME
AND I DON`T UNDERSTAND
WHAT`S YOUR PLAN
THAT YOU CAN`T
BE GOOD TO ME
