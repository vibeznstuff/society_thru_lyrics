I've got all this love,
Waiting just for you.
I just gotta know that your love is true.
Can't keep running, boy,
In and out my life.
Wanna be your girl not coz the mood is right.


If I let you come inside,
Tomorrow will you hide?
Will you be there for me when I need someone to hold?
Baby, don't misunderstand,
I still want you for my man.
I just need a little time before I invest my love.


Don't walk away, boy (Don't walk away).
My love won't hurt you (No, no).

Wanna feel your love, wanna be for sure.
That it's me, me, baby, each and every night.
