Go, go, go
It's time to make the move and we both know,
It's time to step it up a notch 
I'm ready to loose touch
baby boy, 
Go, go, go

This is the crossing at the main intersection,
Up is were we go from here,
Finest selection,
This can take us anywhere,
I don't want protection,
Life is better of the line, ine, ine...

I'm ready for the lift up,
Keep steady beat 
Coz I'm ready for the big jump,
Keep up with me,
If you lose me then you know, 
You're just a bit too slow, 
I only go up, up.
I'm ready to be in control 
And the ground isn't good enough for me,
I know where to find what I want and I'm gonna keep on, 
Keep on, up, up.

No turns now,
We're going straight,
You better hold on tight,
Coz if you fall you're on your own
Coz I'm gonna go on,
No, no, no turns now.

This is the final call for all destination,
This is were you're in or out,
No hesitation,
This is not the time for doubts,
Make your decision ,
Are you on or off the line?, ine, ine...

I'm ready for the lift up,
Keep steady beat 
Coz I'm ready for the big jump,
Keep up with me,
If you lose me then you know, 
You're just a bit too slow, 
I only go up, up.
I'm ready to be in control 
And the ground isn't good enough for me,
I know where to find what I want and I'm gonna keep on, 
Keep on, up, up.
