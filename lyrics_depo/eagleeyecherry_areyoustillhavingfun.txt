You are on your own
You do as you please
Having so much fun
Gone and lost your reason
After all is said and done
Are you still having fun?
How were you to know when youve gone astray?
That happiness would go like a lost emotion
You have always gone your way
Are you happy today?

Well you know when youve been defeated
You dont care and you thank no one
Feeling low you will always need it
Are youre having fun

You dont know what is it youve done
You dont know that...

This was your mistake with the master plan
With all the drugs you take, you can hardly stand
After all is said and done
Are you still having fun?

Well, you know when youve been defeated
You dont care and you thank no one
Feeling low you will always need it
Are youre having fun...
Are you still having fun?

You dont know what it is youve done
Just to show that youre having fun

You dont know what it is youve done
Just to show that...

I can set you straight if you let me stay
I hope Im not too late
No you wont regret it
I can show you the way
And make you happy today

Yes, you know when youve been defeated
You dont care and you thank no one
Feeling low you will always need it

Well, you know when youre being cheated
Yes, you know when youve been defeated
Feeling low you will always need it
Now you*re having fun...

And are you still having fun?
Are you still having fun?
Are you still having
