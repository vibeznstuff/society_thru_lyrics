She said she didn't know me 
Said I'm sweet 

She said she didn't know me 
Now I'm not so sweet 

And yeh yeh baby baby yeh 
Now I'm not so sweet 

Yeh yeh maybe baby yeh 
Set my baby free 

And now I'm looking for ya 
What it could be 

And now I'm looking for ya 
You wanna be with me 

Yeh yeh baby baby yeh 
Now I'm not so sweet 

Yeh yeh maybe baby yeh 
Set my baby free 

Take the long road and walk it 
Take the long road and walk it

Take the long road and walk it 
Take the long road and walk it
