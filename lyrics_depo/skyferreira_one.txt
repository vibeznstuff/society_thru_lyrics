You don't know just how to start me up, 
Don't know how to get me going now. 
(now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now) 

Something's wrong between the two of us, 
I'm not a robot but I feel like one. 
(one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one) 
One, two, three, four - 

Head to the ground, 
I don't ever want the beat to stop. 
(stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop) 
Speaking without a sound, 
You try to call me but you're breaking up. 
(up, up, up, up, up, up) 

And now all I can hear is one. 
(one, one, one) 
And now all I can hear is one. 
(one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one) 

Don't know how to shut you off, 
Don't know how to keep this going now. 
(now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now) 

I feel like I'm about to rust. 
Ruin my heart, I'll buy another one. 
(one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one) 
One, two, three, four - 

Head to the ground, 
I don't ever want the beat to stop. 
(stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop) 
Speaking without a sound, 
You try to call me but you're breaking up. 
(up, up, up, up, up, up) 

And now all I can hear is one. 

I just want to hear your heart. 
Wake me up or I will keep my - 

Head to the ground, 
I don't ever want the beat to stop. 
(stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop) 
Speaking without a sound, 
You try to call me but you're breaking up. 
(up, up, up, up, up, up) 

And now all I can hear is one. 
(one, one)
