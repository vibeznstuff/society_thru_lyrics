When I was an infant in my mothers arms
I would watch the starlight in her face
'Cause I was reaching out to understand the cosmic charm
I am just a starchild born in space.

Way up high above the sky
All that beauty passes by
Whole worlds still unknown
And out beyond the blue
There's a place for people too
It's time for us to go.

I have seen the sun shine bright in paradise
I have been there, I have seen it



We have time
(In my dreams)
Time and space
While we're young
(Floating free)
We can chase to the stars.

Searching for the magic in the universe
Guided by the stars that light my way
I have seen the sun shine bright in paradise
I am just a starchild born in space
