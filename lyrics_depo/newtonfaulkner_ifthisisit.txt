No one move,
No one speak,
Please don’t say that it’s just me.
It’s not just me.
And even though I won't forget,
Just don’t want this to end just yet.
Not just yet.

But if I had one chance to freeze time
And stand still and soak in everything,
I’d choose right now.
If I had one night where sunshine could break through
And show you everything,
I’d choose right now.

If this is it, all we have,
I know I’ve done all I can.
If this is it.
And we can't stop,
And start again,
We can't fast forward to the end.
This is it.

But if I had one chance to freeze time
And stand still and soak in everything,
I’d choose right now.
If I had one night where sunshine could break through
And show you everything,
I’d choose right now.
Before the fears that I once had start coming back…
And I can take the slings and stones and fire,
'Cause I know you'll make it all worthwhile
And everytime I fold, disolve, I'm lying on the ground,
You drag me up again
And again, Oh please come back again,
Oh please come back again.

And I’m so scared I might forget,
Just don’t want this to end just yet,
Not just yet.

But if I'd one chance to freeze time (And I can take the slings and stones and fire,)
And stand still and soak in everything, ('Cause I know you'll make it all worthwhile)
I’d choose right now. (And everytime I fold, disolve, I'm lying on the ground,)
(You drag me up again)
And if I had one night where sunshine could break through
(And I can take the slings and stones and fire,)
And show you everything, ('Cause I know you'll make it all worthwhile)
I’d choose right now, (And everytime I fold, disolve, I'm lying on the ground,)
(You drag me up again)
Before the fears that I once had start coming back… again.
