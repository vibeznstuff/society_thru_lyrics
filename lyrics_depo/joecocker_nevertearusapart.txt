Don't ask me what you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart
I was standing, you were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

We could live for a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears
I told you that we could fly
Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why

I was standing, you were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never, ever tear us apart

Don't ask me I was standing there
You know it's true you were there
Worlds collided, two worlds collided
We're shinning through
And they could never tear us apart

You don't ask me
You were standing
You know it's true
I was there, worlds collided
Two worlds collided
Were shinning through
And they could never tear us apart
