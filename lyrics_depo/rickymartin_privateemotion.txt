Every endless night has a dawning day 
Every darkest sky has a shining ray 
And it shines on you baby can't you see 
You're the only one who can shine for me

 It's a private emotion that fills you tonight 
And a silence falls between us 
As the shadows steal the light 
And wherever you may find it 
Wherever it may lead 
Let your private emotion come to me 
Come to me

When your soul is tired and your heart is weak 
Do you think of love as one way street 
Well it runs both ways, open up your eyes 
Can't you see me here, how can you deny



Every endless night has a dawning day 
Every darkest sky has a shining ray 
It takes a lot to laugh as your tears go by 
But you can find me here till your tears run dry
