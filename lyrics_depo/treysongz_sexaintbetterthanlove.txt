Sex Ain't Better Than Love (Ohhhhh)
Sex Ain't, Sex Ain't (ohhhh) 
Better Than Love


I been outchea in these streets and I done learned
Every girl I gave my loving too was only a substitute
I been outchea in these streets and I done learned
Even though she's in my arms this ain't where my heart belongs
Sex in the air no lovin' here 
Soon as I get through, I'm outta there
And it feels so bad but it feels so good
Wishing I could care girl I never could
But then I fell into your love
Didn't let me touch the ground
Now I see it clear that your heart is there
And all these other women they just can't compare...
Girl I know


Sex Ain't Better Than Love

Sex Ain't Better Than Love

Sex Ain't Better Than Love
Girl you've been my teacher and I've learned that
Sex Ain't Better Than Love
Sex Ain't, Sex Ain't...Sex Ain't better than love


Feelings I thought that I would never have
Oh I'm so open and I got it bad
I gotcha now and Imma make it last
She says my baby she can't wait to have 
Love in the air never been so clear
So beautiful, bring yo body here
Let me fall into your love
I wanna hear the lovely sound
Let me take my time while we in this bed
You were made for me and I don't wanna share...
