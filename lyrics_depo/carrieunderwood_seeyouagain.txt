Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 

Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone
Faded into the setting sun,
Slipped away
But I won’t cry
Cause I know I’ll never be lonely
For you are the stars to me,
You are the light I follow


I will see you again, whoa
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 

I can hear those echoes in the wind at night
Calling me back in time
Back to you
In a place far away
Where the water meets the sky
The thought of it makes me smile
You are my tomorrow


I will see you again, whoa
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again


Sometimes I feel my heart is breaking
But I stay strong and I hold on cause I know

I will see you again, whoa
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, yeah, yeah


I will see you again, whoa
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again.

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 

'Til I see you again,
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
'Til I see you again, whoa
'Til I see you again,

Said goodbye turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone.
