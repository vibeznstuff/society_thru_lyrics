After the glow, the scene, the stage
The sad talk becomes slow but there's one thing I'll never forget
Hey, you gotta pay your dues before you pay the rent
Over the turnstiles and out in the traffic
There's ways of living, it's the way I'm living, right or wrong
It's all that I can do and I wouldn't want to let you be

I want a range life if I could settle down
If I could settle down then I would settle down
I want a range life if I could settle down
If I could settle down then I would settle down

Run from the pigs, the fuzz, the cops, the heat
Pass me your gloves, this crime it is never complete
Until you snort it up or shoot it down, you're never going to feel free
Out on my skateboard the night is just humming
And the gum smacks are the pulse I'll follow if my walkman fades
Well, I got absolutely no one, no one but myself to blame
Don't worry, we're in no hurry, school's out, what did you expect?

I want a range life if I could settle down
If I could settle down then I would settle down
I want a range life if I could settle down
If I could settle down then I would settle down, yeah

Out on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins
Nature kids, I, they don't have no function
I don't understand what they mean and I could really give a fuck
Stone Temple Pilots, they're elegant bachelors
They're foxy to me, are they foxy to you?
I will agree they deserve absolutely nothing, nothing more than me
Dreaming, dream, dream, dream, dream
