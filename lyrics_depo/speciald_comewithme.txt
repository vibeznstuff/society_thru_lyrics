At the end of every week each one of us becomes a freak.
Tonight the DJ makes us move under the sweat drops from the roof.
Each time you let the bass beat hard to know we all spend now apart.
Just activate your energy lets sing the song and come with me.

Just activate your energy lets sing the song and come with me.

The speaker system brings the sound,
And light effects are spinning round
All the people on the floor they shake their bodies cry for more.
Never let this feeling go and let the music take control.
Forget your problems and be free,
Enjoy this moment, come with me!

Turn it up!
(That is it)
