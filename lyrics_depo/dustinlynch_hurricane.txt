I knew when she blew in she wouldn't stay
Every now and then God makes one that way
A red head, wild child with storms in her eyes
I knew I'd never be the same


That's the thing about a hurricane
She's all lightning and wind and rain
Get too close and you're swept away
Better hold on till it breaks
Cause it's a hell of a ride if you can just survive the pain
But that's the thing about a hurricane

She said she was running from her past
And every breath she stole felt like my last
Her kiss told me better get on out of here
But I was too far gone to care




Even in blue skies there ain't no forgettin'
Is it any wonder they name 'em after women
