During reconstruction time they were folks who have been promised 40 acres and a mule.
And they were told a man with their legal papers could be expected on a train from Washington.
They were folks who waited for him and there are folks still waiting for him.
But you can't depend on the train from Washington, it's 100 years overdue…

You can depend on the stars and planets yeah
They'll always tell you the truth
You can depend on the 15th of April Yeah
Somehow it always gets through
You can depend on the daily paper's calls
They surely bring you the blues
But don't depend on the train from Washington 
It's one hundred years overdue

I see people, dragging on their own
I see them standing  
Anxious near the tracks
I see people, a long long way from home
Wondering how they'll ever get back

You can depend on the politicians yeah
Always got a point of view
They are contemporary court magicians yeah
Sleight of mouth will dazzle you
You can depend on the repositions from them
Changes that you've got to go through
But don't depend on the train from Washington 
It's one hundred years overdue

I see people, on their way to work
I see factories bursting at the seams
I see people listening for the whistle
On the train that will carry their dreams

I see people, on their way to work
