Every breath I take is heavy with the thought of you
The moment I awake I'm chasing signs
Never give up, I never give up
It's never enough, it's never enough
You're not the one that's scared that the sun won't shine on me

I've been holding on for some kind of miracle
I'll be right there if you're ever alone
Holding on for some kind of miracle
I'll be right there if you're ever alone

Every step I take is heavy with the thought of you
The moments I delay will make you mine
Never give up, I never give up
It's never enough, it's never enough
You're not the one that's scared that the sun won't shine on me

I've been holding on for some kind of miracle
I'll be right there if you're ever alone
Holding on for some kind of miracle
I'll be right there if you're ever alone

If you're ever alone...

And I'm holding
And I'm holding on
And I'm holding
And I'm holding on
And I'm holding
And I'm holding on
