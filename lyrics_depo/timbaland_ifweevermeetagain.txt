What's somebody like you doing in a place like this?
Say, did you come alone or did you bring all your friends?
Say, what's your name, what are you drinking?
I think I know what are you're thinking
Baby, what's your sign? Tell me yours, and I'll tell you mine
Say what's somebody like you doing in a place like this?

(come on!)


I'll never be the same, if we ever meet again
Won't let you get away say if we ever meet again
This free fall's got me so
Kiss me all night don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same, if we ever meet again

Oh, oh, say if we ever meet again

Do you come here much? I swear I've seen your face before
Hope you don't see me blush but I can't help, but want you more, more
Baby, tell me what's your story? I ain't shy, donâ€™t you worry
I'm flirting with my eyes, wanna leave with you tonight
Do you come here much? I've gotta see your face some more
(some more 'cause, baby...)



If we ever meet again
I'll have so much more to say
If we ever meet again

If we ever meet again, again
I won't let you go away
If we ever meet again

If we ever, ever meet again
I'll have so much more to say
If we ever meet again
If we ever, ever meet again
I won't let you go away
