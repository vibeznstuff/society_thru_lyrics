When she said that you were through
I thought that there was nothing that I could do
Just because she ran right here
Doesn't mean I interfered
Now I'm wondering of we can feel the same
Cause she keeps whispering your name
She keeps on whispering your name
Like she's just waiting

She once told me how she felt
Didn't just want me to hear it from someone else
There were unknowns she couldn't know
But she hoped you two would grow
And when you didn't she was brought to me in pain

And she keeps whispering your name
She keeps on whispering your name
Like she's just waiting

If it's just a little fling a simple thing
I'll try not to pretend
If it's just for jealousy she's using me
That might be hard to mend

Oh what else can I do
But try to give her more than she got from you
And when she wakes up suddenly and she says you name to me
I'll just hope its force of habit and not need

Cause she keeps whispering your name
She keeps on whispering your name
Like she's just waiting

Oh tell me what is fair
When nothing's wrong
And she just stares
Like she's just waiting
