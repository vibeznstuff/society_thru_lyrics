The hot Sunni sun 
passes Moaning Mosque Spire.
B-company's pinned down
and under heavy fire.
Underneath the palms
there's improvised bombs.
Because Jihad Johnny
Knows - Yankee is a liar.


An eye for an eye.
And blood for Texas Tea.
At the call to prayer
Al Queda's on his knees.
Isac versus Ishmael. 
Allah versus Christ.
Zarqawi's on the offense 
picking up the beat.

There's celebratory fire
And a purple thumb vote.
Tom cruise is on a sortie
from a gulf love boat.
Smart bombs are coming, 
See the children running.
The dead, they are all laughing, 
But we don't get the joke.



They lost another friend today.
It's getting rough over there.
They say the whole things fucked.
I wish the boys were back.
At least I know they're still alive.
Another letter from Iraq.

Presents full of Christmas loot.
All that's left of Bullet Billy- 
is a pair of bloody boots. 
His mom is on the phone,
His girl is all alone.
We all stand in the rain 
for a twenty-one gun salute.
