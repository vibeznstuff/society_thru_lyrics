Sometimes you don’t know what you got until it’s gone
Sometimes it’s hard to believe I could have been that wrong
And I finally figured it out as she was driving away
And now I’m living with the fact that out there today


Somebody somewhere is saying those things I know I should have said
Somebody somewhere ain’t gonna let her go quite as easy as I did
I hope that she’s happy as much as it hurts me to see it all go down from here
Ya there’s somebody out there holding my somebody somewhere

Took some time but I get along fine all by myself
And looking around but I still haven’t found anybody else
Sometimes I let myself wonder what she’s doing right now
Even though I know there’s a pretty good chance 
That she’s already found



Maybe on a beach in Mexico
Maybe parked in the shade on an old dirt road
Ya I don’t know
I don’t wanna know



I hope that she’s happy
As much as it hurts me to see it all go down from here
Ya there’s somebody out there
Oh there’s somebody out there
Ya there’s somebody out there holding my somebody somewhere

Somebody somewhere
