There's a tangled mess of sheets on the bed
A lack of sleep poundin' in my head
We both regret some of the things we said
But we love the way it ends

Sometimes I think
We hurt each other just because of where it'll lead
Sometimes I think
We're fighting just to be lovers and all so needlessly


Good as we are at gettin' it on
How come we just can't get along?
The way we love, it don't seem right
The way we fuss, the way we fight
I got a crazy idea, how 'bout maybe tonight
We make up without a fight


They say don't go to bed angry, that's true
But it's really something when we do
(Madder you make me, the more I want you)
Girl, I admit


Sometimes I think
It couldn't be any better
(And I couldn't want you more)
And sometimes I think
We don't belong together
Confusing love and war


Good as we are at gettin' it on
How come we just can't get along?
The way we love, it don't seem right
The way we fuss, the way we fight
I got a crazy idea, how 'bout maybe tonight
We make up without a fight


We ain't givin' up without a fight
We can make up without a fight
(No, we ain't givin' up, we can make up)


Good as we are at gettin' it on
How 'bout maybe tonight
We make up without a fight
