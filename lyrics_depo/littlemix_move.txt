Mmh 


Hey baby (mmh )
Tell me your name
I got a fever for you
I just can't explain
But there's just one problem
I'm a bit old school
When it comes to lovin'
I ain't chasing you
Ain't waiting
I'm on a roll
You've got to let yourself go


Oh (talk to me)
You know that I've been waiting for you (and I noticed you, too)
Don't leave me standing all by myself (I won't leave you standing all alone)
'Cause I ain't looking at no one else (oh, baby)


Hey,
Get your back off the wall
Don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot,
I think that I might fall (woo!)
Feeling like it's my birthday
Like Christmas day came early
Just what I want
So when we move
You move


Hey
Get your back off the wall
Don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot
I think that I might fall
Feeling like it's my birthday
Like Christmas day came early
Just what I want
So when we move
You move


Oh silly
Why you afraid?
Don't be a big baby
Quit playing games
And put your arms around me
You know what to do
And we can take it down low


Oh
You know that I've been waiting for you (for you!)
Don't leave me standing all by myself (myself!)
Cause I ain't looking at no one else (looking at no one else, looking at no one else)
(hey yeah oh)

Hey
Get your back off the wall
Don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot
I think that I might fall
Feeling like it's my birthday
Like Christmas day came early
Just what I want
So when we move
You move

Get your back off the wall
Don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot (yeah!)
I think that I might fall
Feeling like it's my birthday
Like Christmas day came early (early! Yeah)
Just what I want
So when we move
You move


I know that you wanna
But you can't cause you gotta
Stay cool in the corner
When the truth is that you wanna move
So move
I know that you wanna
But you can't cause you gotta
Stay cool in the corner
When the truth is that you wanna move
So move


Move it baby, oh!
You know that I've been waiting for you (ooh!)
Don't leave me standing all by myself
Cause I ain't looking at no one else
Looking at no one else
Looking at no one else


Hey! Hey!
I'm ready, hey!
Boy come and get me
Don't be scared
Show me what you do
Don't you know a girl
Like a boy who moves?
Hey! Hey!
I'm ready, hey!
Boy come and get me
Don't be scared
Show me what you do
Don't you know a girl
Like a boy who moves?

Hey,
