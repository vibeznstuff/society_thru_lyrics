I never thought there would be a time
When all you'd wanna do is fight
It's made me suffer lonely days
And I'm waitin for the evenings sun
To come along and calm me down
Can't you see that on my face
Without me you would be nowhere
All alone I've cared
You owe it all to me
Without me you would be nowhere
All alone I've cared
You owe it all to me
I know, it seems to you sometimes
When we're alone I tend to hide
Leave my feelings locked behind a door
As I watch the wind cut through the trees
I never wanted you to leave
I only wish I'd told you this before
Without me you would be nowhere
All alone I've cared
You owe it all to me
Without me you would be nowhere
All alone I've cared
You owe it all to me
What kinda life am I to lead
With this love you've given me
I thought you were a friend of mine
But everyday you're someone new
And that's the one I've got to lose
Why do you make it so hard to fight
Without me you would be nowhere
All alone I've cared
You owe it all to me
Without me you would be nowhere
All alone I've cared
You owe it all to me
