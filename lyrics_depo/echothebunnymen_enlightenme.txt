It was cheap at half the price
Took a shovel where a spoon would suffice
Now I can't see you
Now I can't see you

Regimental in my way
Detrimental at the end of the day
But you won't be told
No, you won't be told

I will be, I will be
I won't be frightened
I will be, I will be
I'll be enlightened

Would it pain you so to say
There's a splinter in your
Splendour today
I could believe you
I would believe you

There's a world inside your world
There's a glass house where the insults are hurled
But you won't be told
No, you won't be told

I will be, I will be
I won't be frightened
I will be, I will be
I'll be enlightened

Took a chainsaw to my mind
Did a rain check,left this sad world behind
But all will be fine
Yes, all will be fine

I will be, I will be
I won't be frightened
I will be, I will be
I won't be enlightened

I will be, I will be
(You're shy) 
I won't be frightened
(You try but still the words won't come)
I will be, I will be
(You're shy) 
I won't be enlightened

I will be, I will be
(You're shy)
I won't be frightened
(You try but still the words won't come)
I will be, I will be
(Your chance had turned) 
I won't be enlightened

I will be, I will be
I won't be frightened
I will be, I will be
I won't be enlightened
