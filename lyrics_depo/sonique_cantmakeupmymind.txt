I cannot make up my mind


Feelings deep inside of me, I know it's there and it wants to be free
But I'm not sure.
These emotions, I have a little fear, but I'll find strength in my ideas
I don't know who is wrong, so I will just sing this song


I cannot make up my mind,
Should I be good or bad,
Should I go with the flow,
Or will I take control?
It cannot be up to me, it must be up to you,
I don't know what to do, maybe I'll follow you
Oh Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


I feel as light as a feather
My heart is broken 
Should I move on? I'm not sure (you make it all seem so real)
These emotions, I have a little fear, but I'll find strength In my ideas.
I don't know who is wrong, so I will just sing this song



Yeah, yeah

I just don't know, yeah 



Yeah 

I Call on you, it's never hard on you
