This must be my house, ‘cause the key fit,
But it don’t look like it did when I left this morning
There were pictures by sofa that seem to be missing.
Yes, I better check the bedroom, damn, it’s empty
I guess I should have listened when she said she wasn’t happy.

She didn’t even leave a note goodbye
Right now I could crawl in a bottle and die.

Thank God she left the whiskey,
I’m gonna need it to get it through this.
If I’m gonna make it past her
Pack it up and the bottle just might be strong enough
To make me believe that there’s a chance
She might miss me.
Thank God she left the whiskey.

Well, she must have had it all planed,
‘cause there’s no way she just woke up
And said “today’s the day”
She was leaving ‘cause a heart takes a long time
To find the pieces.
I never took the time to worry about
How it feel without her, but I’m worrying now.

Thank God she left the whiskey,
I’m gonna need it to get it through this.
If I’m gonna make it past her
Pack it up and the bottle just might be strong enough
To make me believe that there’s a chance
She might miss me.
Thank God she left the whiskey.

She talked about the leaving,
I just never thought she would.
And now I’m hurting like I’m never thought I could.

Thank God she left the whiskey,
I’m gonna need it to get it through this.
If I’m gonna make it past her
Pack it up and the bottle just might be strong enough
To make me believe that there’s a chance
She might miss me.
There’s a chance she might miss me.
Thank God she left the whiskey.
