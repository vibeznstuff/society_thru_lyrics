I live my life walking down this street
I meet the faces of the people I see
All the time I see your reflection
All the time I see your reflection
It's okay to feel alone
It's okay to be alone
All the time I see your reflection
All the time I see your reflection

Cause when I'm with you
It seems so easy
It seems so easy
My best days are with you
They are so easy
They are so easy

Yeah, I don't like giving up
Cause giving up is easy
And I'll see you again
Just tell me where you'll meet me

When I'm with you
It seems so easy
It seems so easy
My best days are with you
They are so easy
They are so easy, yeah!

When I'm with you
It seems so easy
It seems so easy
My best days are with you
They are so easy
They are so easy, yeah!
