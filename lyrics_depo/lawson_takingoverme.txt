Whoo-uuh-uuh 

My heart is racing
She puts her hands in mine
I feel them shaking
I look into her eyes
And I tell her that it's gonna be alright
And I'm never ever gonna make you cry

I'll fix your broken heart
I'll make it beat again
I'll never let you down
On me you can depend
And I'll tell her that we'll always be this way
Every day that she's the one that makes me wanna say

Whoo-uuh-uuh you're taking over me
Whoo-uuh-uuh I'm in ecstasy
Whoo-uuh-uuh I just can't believe the love, love, love is taking over me
Love, love, love is taking over me

If I close my eyes
I can see your smile
I can hear the laugh I love and I can't get enough
I can pull you close in a moment just like this
I can stop the world with only just your kiss

Whoo-uuh-uuh you're taking over me
Whoo-uuh-uuh I'm in ecstasy
Whoo-uuh-uuh I just can't believe the love, love, love is taking over me
Love, love, love is taking over me
(Taking over me, taking over me)

Touch my skin with your body
Love is taking over me

Whoo-uuh-uuh it's taking over me
Whoo-uuh-uuh I'm in ecstasy
Whoo-uuh-uuh I just can't believe the (love), love, (love), love is taking over me

Whoo-uuh-uuh it's taking over me
Whoo-uuh-uuh I'm in ecstasy
Whoo-uuh-uuh I just can't believe
The (love), love (love), love it's taking over me
(Love), love, (love) love, (love) it's taking over me

Touch my skin with your body (Whoo-uuh-uuh)
Love is taking over me (Whoo-uuh-uuh)
Touch my skin with your body (Whoo-uuh-uuh)
Love is taking over me (Whoo-uuh-uuh)
