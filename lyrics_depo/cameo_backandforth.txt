There's a special kind of person
sometimes she's not all she seems
you only see what she wants you to see
and before you really know it always seems to go

Back &amp; forth 
(Our love goes)

Take your chances if you will (those looks can kill)
It'll make you go round &amp; around
You got to know it by now
that the truth is you just can't win 
loves funny like that
It'll make you blow your cap
sacrifice everything and money
love has no guarantee's
It'll always really be

Back &amp; forth 

Take stabs dip and dab
forever tryin to find your way
it's a sellers lament 
for all the love you spent
you must have thought it was a bottomless pit
you can't do it like that
love will show you where it's at
what you put up you'll surely get back
cause there's no other way
if you play you'll pay

Back &amp; forth 

Love has no guarantee's
It'll always really be

Back &amp; forth
