Baby don't you want me to go 
So honey, why don't you beg me to stay 
For love, and talk the way we used to talk 
Till we both know what we've lost 
Never say the words we did before 
When it was over 

Love ain't here anymore 
Love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away, to a town called yesterday 
Love ain't here anymore 

Listen, oh listen, I don't wanna let go 
So maybe we can change the way we feel 
For love, and open up the way we did before 
Now is the right time 
And I'm sure you'd never say the words you did 
Until you knew it was over 

Love ain't here anymore 
Love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away, to a town called yesterday 
Love ain't here anymore 

And when I find a place for me to keep my sweet love 
Then I will leave it there forever more, yeah 
And when I find someone to share I'll never give up 
I will hold you and believe that this life leads to more 

Love ain't here anymore 
Love ain't here anymore 
It's gone away, to a town called yesterday 
Love ain't here anymore
