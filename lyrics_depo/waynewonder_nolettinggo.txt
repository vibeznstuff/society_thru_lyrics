Got somebody she's a beauty
Very special really and truly
Take good care of me like it's her duty
Want you right by my side night and day


No lettting go No holding back
Because you are my lady
When I'm with you its all a that 
Girl I, am so glad we've made it
No letting go No holding back
No holding Back no
When I'm with you it's all a that
All a that


They say good things must come to an end
But I'm optimistic about being your friend
Though I made you cry by my doings
With Keisha and Anisha but that
Was back then


No lettting go No holding back
Because you are my lady
When I'm with you its all a that 
Girl I, am so glad we've made it
No letting go No holding back
No holding Back no
When I'm with you it's all a that
All a that


Really appreciate you loving me
After all that we've been thru
Really appreciate you loving me
All times,time


Got somebody she's a beauty
Very special really and truly
Take good care of me like it's her duty
Want you right by my side night and day


No lettting go No holding back
Because you are my lady
When I'm with you its all a that 
Girl I, am so glad we've made it
No letting go No holding back
No holding Back no
When I'm with you it's all a that
All a that
