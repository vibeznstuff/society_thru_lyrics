Who you trying to get crazy with, ése?
Don't you know I'm loco?

To da one on da flam
Boy it's tough
I just toss that ham on the fryin pan
Like spam
It's done when I come in slam
Damn, I feel like the son of sam
Don't make me wrek shit
Wit a automatic got me goin' like general electric
Damn
The lights are blinkin' I'm thinkin'
It's all over when go out drinkin'
OH makin' my mind slow,
that's why I don't fuck with the big four-oh
Bro, I got ta' maintain
Cuz a nigga like me is goin; insane


Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Crazy insane, got no brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!


Do my shit undercover, now it's time for the blubba
Blabber, to watch that belly get fatter
Fat boy on a diet, don't try it
I'll jack yo' ass like a looter in a riot
My shit's fat, like a sumo, slamming dat ass
Leavin your face in the grass
Cause you know, I don't take a duro, lightly
Punks just jealous cause they can't outwrite me
Or kick that style, wicked, wild
Happy face nigga never seen me smile
Rip that mainframe, I'll explain
A nigga like me is going insane


Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Crazy insane, got no brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!


Like Louie Armstrong, played the trumpet
I'll hit that bong and break you off something
Soon I got to get my props
Cops, come and try to snatch my crops
These pigs wanna blow my house down
Head underground to the next town
They get mad when they come to raid my pad
And I'm out in the nine-deuce Cad'
Yes I'm the pirate, pilot
Of this ship if I get with the ultraviolet dream
Hide from the red light beam
Now do you believe in the unseen?
Look, but don't make you eyes strain
A nigga like me is going insane


Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Crazy insane, got no brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
