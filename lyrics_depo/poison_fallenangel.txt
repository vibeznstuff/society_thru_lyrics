She stepped off the bus out into the city streets
Just a small town girl with her whole life
Packed in a suitcase by her feet

But somehow the lights didn't
shine as bright as they did
On her mama's TV screen

And the work seemed harder
And the days seemed longer
Than she ever thought they'd be

But you know you got to stick to your guns
When it all comes down
Cause sometimes you can't choose
It's like heads they win
Tails you're gonna lose


Win big--Mama's fallen angel
Lose big--living out her lies
Wants it all--Mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life

Now she found herself in the fast lane living day to day
Turned her back on her best friends, yeah
And let her family slip away

Just like a lost soul
caught up in the Hollywood scene
All the parties and the limousines

Such a good actress hiding all her pain
Trading her memories for fortune and fame

Just a step away from the edge of a fall
Caught between heaven and hell
Where's the girl I knew a year ago



Too much too soon
Or just a little too late
Cause when her ship came in
She wasn't there and it just wouldn't wait
