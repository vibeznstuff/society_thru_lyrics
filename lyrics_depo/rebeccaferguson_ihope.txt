I used to hate you so easily
Look into your eyes so eagerly
And where there was cold
I wouldn't walk away
'Cause when there's money love is blind
He's so blind

But after a time
I realized that for me to grow
I've got to let go

I hope life treats you good
I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope life treats you well
I hope she treats you well
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope that she is kind
I hope that she is kind
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope

'Cause after a time you realize that it ain't easy
'Cause after a time you realize that you should've believed me

I hope life treats you good
I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope

Loving ourselves comes so easily
Forgiveness was like the biggest sin to me
And where there was war
I wouldn't walk away

But after a time
I realized that for me to grow
I've got to let go

I hope life treats you good
I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope life treats you well
I hope she treats you well
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope that she is kind
I hope that she is kind
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope

Hope life treats you good
I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope

Right now, I have taken all that I am
And I forgive you, and I forgive you
For all that you are

I hope that life is good in a way you haven't been good
I hope that she is kind even though you haven't been kind

'Cause I'll forgive, 'cause I'll forgive you, 'cause I'll forgive you
Yeah I'll forgive, I'll forgive you, I'll forgive you
