A betting fool, a gambling man
No sooner up you're down again
Mama said you won't get hurt
Don't play the cards, you won't get burned
But there's a place where I still win
But there's no money in this thing
The game of hearts puts me in spades
The only game I got it made

Oh, I'm lucky in love!
Yes, I've got the winning touch
Lucky in love!
Suddenly, I'm dangerous

I'm betting on a filly down at the track
A natural-born winner, that's a fact
A hundred yards from the winning post
The horse fell down, must seen a ghost
But there's a place where I still win
That is still my sure-fire thing
I will play the jack of spades
You play the queen, I'll play the knave

Oh, I'm lucky in love!
Yes, I've got the winning touch
Lucky in love!!
Suddenly, I'm dangerous

I know it's a mystery when the numbers come up
'Cause mathematics is Greek to me
But I'm lucky, I'm lucky, I'm lucky in love

Yeah, Las Vegas at night at the roulette wheel
Yeah, Monte Carlo try to cut a deal
Atlantic City, I lose at craps
Back in London try to win in back
And late at night I lay in bed
With a pistol to my head
Swear I couldn't take no more
And in she walks right through my door

Oh, I'm lucky in love!
When I think I've had enough
Lucky in love!
Yes, I've got the winning touch

Suddenly, I'm dangerous

Yes I'm lucky, Yes I'm lucky
Yes I'm lucky, yes I'm lucky
Yes I'm lucky, yes I'm lucky
Lucky with the ladies
Thank God for the ladies
Otherwise, I'd go, I'd go crazy
How about a line of credit
For say, ten thousand dollars?
Eighteen on the red
Put me, put me home to bed

Yes I'm lucky, yes I'm lucky
Yes I'm lucky, yes I'm lucky
Yes I'm lucky, yes I'm lucky
Lucky with the ladies
I'm sitting here with a full house
I just can't believe I'll lose out on this
Okay! Okay! Your ten thousand and ten thousand more
You want to raise me, you want to raise me? How about this?
Twenty thousand and twenty thousand more
Okay! You want to see me? Well I got, I got a full house
What's that? A royal flush?
Well, ain't that a bust, I'm broke!
