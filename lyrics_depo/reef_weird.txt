In my arms, and my legs,
And my hips, and my shoulders,
And my neck, to my feet,
In my brain, let's-

Must I shout, to be heard;
Heard by you, and your kind,
In your offices, all around,
Listen up, for a-

Ohh, it's a weird feeling friend.
Ohh, I can't understand it at all.

Speak of me, when I'm dead,
with your hand, on my face.
All those memories that besot you,
Where's your life? Loosen-

Ohh, and I don't wish it upon no one, yeah, come on.

Ohh-
Yeah, say come on now.
Ohh-
Listen up now.

In the morning, when we wake,
We go down, to the place.
When we get there, we kick a ball,
We kick a ball, in the car.

Said it'd make me feel alright.
Feel alright.
Put a little smile on my face
