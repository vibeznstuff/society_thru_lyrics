Remembering the first time we made love
Remembering the first time we made love
I was just recalling

Sitting here glad as I am
With your photograph, I hold it in my hands
Aching for a vision of you, you're right in front of me
Looking at the photograph, and the way you were looking at me

I was just remembering the first time we made love
I was just recalling
Remembering the first time we made love
Remembering the first time we made love
I was just recalling
Remembering the first time we made love

Sitting here looking at the table
It's just like a photograph
There's you and me, fruit, drink, good food
Oh the things we did, the things we did
From the shower we took to the very first look

Remembering the first time we made love
I was just recalling
Remembering the first time we made love
Remembering the first time we made love
I was just recalling
Remembering the first time we made love

You're rich, you're beautiful, you're in love
How wonderful life can be
Just the way you wanted it to be
Yet I am the colour of the night
I am the colour of the night
If you could only make it right
If you could only make it right

Remembering the first time we made love
I was just recalling
Remembering the first time we made love
Remembering the first time we made love
I will never forget you girl
Remembering the first time we made love
Remembering the first time we made love
Love you, love you, love you girl
Remembering the first time we made love
