Feel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are
Dancing on the walls.
Is this dream or is it now
Is this a vision or normality I see
Before my eyes.

I wonder why I wonder how
That it seems the powers getting stronger
Every day
I feel a strength an inner fire
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore

There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying.

Just by looking through your eyes
He could see the future penetrating right
In through your mind
See the truth and see your lies
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise

There's time to live and time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying...
...and reborn again??
