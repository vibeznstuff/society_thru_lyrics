You... 
Don't wanna hear your name
Don't wanna see your smile
'Cause baby, I'm still crying

And go, it's time for you to get out
I'm sick of standing my ground
'Cause I just stand up running
And I go to sleeping believing in tomorrow
But I wake up screaming, halfway through the night

You know I can't get over
And I don't know why
You know I can't get over
No matter how I try
And I don't know why

We...
Will always be the same
You say it's time for a change
But I can't see one coming

So I climb out of the darkness of your lovin'
But I end up falling back into your arms

You know I can't get over
And I don't know why
You know I can't get over
No matter how I try
And I don't know why

From beginning to end once again
Right back to where we started
I know, I'm right 
We were wrong all along

You know I can't get over
And I don't know why
You know I can't get over
No matter how I try

You know I can't get over
And I don't know why
You know I can't get over
No matter how I try
And I don't know why

You know I can't get over
