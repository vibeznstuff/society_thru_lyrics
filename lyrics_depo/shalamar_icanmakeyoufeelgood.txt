Are you the kind to put your heart on the line
Or one who stays out of reach
'Cause unlike other guys I won't waste your time
I just wanna practice what I preach

Girl, love can be such a challenge
A game where there can be two winners
Unlike any sport
It depends on the prize
And knowing where the real thing lies
To make a long story short

Baby, I can make you feel good
I can make you feel good
Let me lay this good love on you
Baby, I can make you feel good
I can make you feel good
You can say I really want you
Oh, it's so good

There's guys that offer you diamonds and pearls
Those are the ones without the need
Other guys say that they can give you the world
But a world of love is what you'll get from me

Girl, those material things
Been born to me before the day I found you
Now I truly believe
All the money in the world
Can't comfort you the way I wrap my arms around you
And I'll always be there

Baby, I can make you feel good
I can make you feel good
Let me lay this good love on you (Whoa? whoa?)
Baby, I can make you feel good
I can make you feel good
You can say I really want you

Let me make you feel good
I can make you feel good
Oh...
I can make you feel good
I can make you feel good
Oh...

Oh, it's good, oh, baby
Oh, so good
Let me lay it on you, baby
Oh, so good

Let me make you feel good
I can make you feel good
Let me make you feel good
I can make you feel good

Are you the kind to put your heart on the line
Or one who stays out of reach
'Cause unlike other guys I won't waste your time
I just wanna practice what I preach

'Cause love can be such a challenge
A game where there can be two winners
Unlike any sport
It depends on the prize
And knowing where the real thing lies
To make a long story short

Baby, I can make you feel good
I can make you feel good
So forget about what he did wrong
Baby, I can make you feel good
I can make you feel good
With a love that is, oh, so strong

I can make you feel good
I can make you feel good
Won't you let me make you feel good
I can make you feel good
Baby, I can make you feel good
I can make you feel good
Let me lay this good love on you
Oh, oh, I can make you feel good
I can make you feel good
