 "You are not a God." 
 "Why don't you pull the trigger and find out" 

I wake up in the morning 
And I raise my weary head 
I've got an old coat for a pillow 
And the earth was last night's bed 
I don't know where I'm going 
Only God knows where I've been 
I'm a devil on the run 
A six gun lover 
A candle in the wind, yeah 

When you're brought into this world 
They say you're born in sin 
Well at least they gave me something 
I didn't have to steal or have to win 
Well, they tell me that I'm wanted 
Yeah, I'm a wanted man 
I'm a colt through your stable 
I'm what Cain was to Abel 
Mister catch me if you can 

I'm going down (down) in a blaze of glory 
Take me now but know the truth 
I'm going out (out) in a blaze of glory 
And Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood 
I'm no one's son, call me young gun 

You ask about my conscience 
And I offer you my soul 
You ask if I'll grow to be a wise man 
Well I ask if I'll grow old 
You ask me if I've known love 
And what it's like to sing songs in the rain 
Well I've seen love come, I've seen it shot down 
I've seen it die in vain 

Shot down (down) in a blaze of glory 
Take me now but know the truth 
'Cause I'm going down (down) in a blaze of glory 
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood 
I'm the devil's son, call me young gun, na... yeah 



Each night I go to bed 
I pray the Lord my soul to keep 
No I ain't looking for forgiveness 
But before I'm six foot deep 
Lord, I gotta ask a favor 
And I hope you'll understand 
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest 
Let this boy's die like a man 
Staring down a bullet 
Let me make my final stand 

Shot down (down) in a blaze of glory 
Take me now but know the truth 
I'm going out (out) in a blaze of glory 
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood 
I'm no one's son, call me young gun 
I'm a young gun, yeah 
Young gun, yeah..., Young gun
