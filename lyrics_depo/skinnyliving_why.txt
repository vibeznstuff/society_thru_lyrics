I was high I was hiding
You were knocking on the door
And I was standing behind it
Keeping quiet in the hall

Could've walked, could've turned
Your eyes away
Nobody would've blamed you

I was cold on the concrete
I'd mistaken the truth for a lie
You were there and you saved me
And I don't know why

I was cracked I was hollow
Dried tears in my blood red eyes
But you cared and you saved me
And I don't know why

How many suffer in silence
Cuz real men don't cry
It's not enough to cover your eyelids
A soul won't go blind
No lie

Could've walked, could've turned
Your eyes away
Nobody would've blamed you

I was cold on the concrete
I'd mistaken the truth for a lie
You were there and you saved me
And I don't know why

I was cracked I was hollow
Dried tears in my blood red eyes
But you cared and you saved me
And I don't know why

Lost my head in all those ideal places
No vital signs
But you got me just in time

I was cold on the concrete
I'd mistaken the truth for a lie
You were there and you saved me
And I don't know why

I was cracked I was hollow
Dried tears in my blood red eyes
But you cared and you saved me
And I don't know why

No I don't know why
