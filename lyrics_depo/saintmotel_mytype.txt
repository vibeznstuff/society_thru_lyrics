Take a look around the room,
Love comes wearing disguises.
How to go about and choose.
Break it down by shapes and sizes.
I'm a man who's got very specific taste.

You're, You're, You're just my type.
Oh, You got a pulse and you are breathing.
You're, You're, You're just my type.
Ooh, I think it's time that we get leaving.
You're, You're, You're just my type.

When there's loving in the air,
Don't fight it just keep breathing.
I can't help myself but stare.
Double check for double meanings.
I'm a man who's got very specific taste.

You're, You're, You're just my type.
Oh, You got a pulse and you are breathing.
You're, You're, You're just my type.
Ooh, I think it's time that we get leaving.
You're, You're, You're just my type.

You're, You're, You're just my type.
Oh, You got a pulse and you are breathing.
You're, You're, You're just my type.
Ooh, I think it's time that we get leaving.
You're, You're, You're just my type.
