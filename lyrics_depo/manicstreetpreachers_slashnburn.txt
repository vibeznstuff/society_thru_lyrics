You need your stars, even killers have prestige
Access to a living you will not see
24 boredom, I'm convicted instantly
Gorgeous poverty of created needs

Slash and burn
Kill to live
Kill for kicks
3rd world to the 1st
Kill to live

Worms in the garden more real than a McDonalds
Drain your blood and let the Exxon spill in
Look around here, you see nothing is very real
Chained to economy now famine has been

Slash and burn
Kill to live
Kill for kicks
3rd world to the 1st
Kill to live

That's all you need
That's all you need
That's all you need
That's all you need

Madonna drinks Coke and so you can too
Taste's real good not like a sweet poison should
Too much comfort to get decadent
Politics here's death and God is safer sex

Slash and burn
Kill to live
Kill for kicks
3rd world to the 1st
Kill to live
Kill for kicks

Slash and burn
Kill to live
Kill for kicks
3rd world to the 1st
Kill to live

That's all you need
That's all you need
That's all you need
That's all you need
