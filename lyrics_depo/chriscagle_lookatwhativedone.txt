I saw it in her eyes
When I was sayin' goodbye
That girl, she ain't gonna be alright
'Cause I could tell
She'd be goin' through a livin' hell
And I wouldn't be there by her side

And lord I felt so bad as I sat and watched her cry
Thinkin' I was movin' on and she was barely gettin' by

Look at what I've done to her
Look at how I made her feel
I gave back her heart, the broken part
She got the wrong end of the deal
And look at what it's done to me
You gotta know it tears me up
I gave it everything I had, and
Lord, it just wasn't enough
And hurtin' her like this seems so wrong
Yeah, look at what I've done to her
Now she's alone

I saw her out last night
And she was havin' a good time
That girl, it looks like she's doin' fine
But then I saw a man
Walk up and take her by the hand
And I, oh god, I almost died

And then it hit me, she didn't really need me
I just sat there for a while, until I finally smiled

Look at what I've done to her
Look at how I made her feel
She's found somebody new
And look who took the time to heal
And look at what it's done to me
You gotta know it tears me up
To have walked away from the love we made
And just leave it in a cloud of dust
And now it's got me thinkin' maybe I was wrong
After all the things I've done to her
Now she's strong

I walked up and said hello
She said, "it's goo to see ya
But hey, I've gotta go"

Look at what I've done to her
Look at how I made her feel
She's standin' tall, she's got it all
Got the world at her heels
And look at what it's done to me
Look at how it makes me hurt
If I could go back now
I swear somehow
I'd find a way to make it work

Ain't life funny
Now I'm the one alone
Look at what I've done to me
She's gone
