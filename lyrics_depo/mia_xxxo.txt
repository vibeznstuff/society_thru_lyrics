Time after time
You been coppin' mine but
Can I have a good time at yours tonight

'Cause everytime we try to get close
There is always something big I'm thinking about

(You want me)
XXXO
XXXO
(You want me)
XXXO
XXXO
(You want me)
XXXO
XXXO
(You want me)
XXXO
(You want me)
XXXO

You want me to be
Somebody who I'm really not
You want me to be
Somebody who I'm really not
You want me to be
Somebody who I'm really not
You want me to be
Somebody who I'm really not

A knock at the door
Then we hit the floor
And all I know is that you leave me wanting more

I don't let it show
But I think you know
'Cause you're tweeting me like Tweety Bird on your iPhone

(You want me)
XXXO
XXXO
(You want me)
XXXO
XXXO
(You want me)
XXXO
XXXO
(You want me)
XXXO
(You want me)
XXXO

You want me to be
Somebody who I'm really not
You want me to be
Somebody who I'm really not
You want me to be
Somebody who I'm really not
You want me to be
Somebody who I'm really not
