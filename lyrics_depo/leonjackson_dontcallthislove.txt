Cry in the rain 
Nothing to say 
Lately I wonder 
Who you are today 
I know all about you 
But I don't understand 
Why you won't see me 
Why things have changed 

Oh baby something is going on 
God knows I know 

Cus you can't keep nothing from me 
Cus I know what I've seen now 
You can try your best to deceive 
But I know where you've been now 
And you can cry your heart out to me 
But it's hard to believe 
Don't call this love 

I might be no good 
In your eyes only 
But one day you'll see that 
I was good for you honey 
You need to grow up 
Get your life together 
We can't go on now 
Doing this to each other 

Oh baby something is going on 
God knows you know 

Cos you can't keep nothing from me 
Cos I know what I've seen now 
You can try your best to deceive 
But I know where you've been now 
And you can cry your heart out to me 
But it's hard to believe 
Don't call this love 

Listen to me 
Baby, don't call this love 

Cos you can't keep nothing from me 
Cos I know what I've seen now 
You can try your best to deceive 
But I know where you've been now 
And you can cry your heart out to me 
But it's hard to believe 
Don't call this love 

I said, don't call this love 
Don't call this, this love 
Don't call it love
