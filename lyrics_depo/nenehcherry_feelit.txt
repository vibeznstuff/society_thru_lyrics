Luck has been on your side boy, 
And life is what you made it
As you've done what you can do
People say
People say that your the only one
Time keeps slipping thru the hour class
You're living in the future boy
But there something inside
Something to hide
In too much pride
Maybe you cried
Wondering why
You know you've got to feel it
Feel it over you, under you
Talking to your little sister now
Tell her how you turned to liquid love
Don't get beaten by the tide boy
You've got so much to give of yourself
Some of the things you said
Been living in your head you know
And what you feel
Are just trade marks of your suffering
But you're looking for a reason for everything
'Coz you know that there has to be something in
Every little thing that you're
Feeling feeling feeling feeling, over you
Voices on your shoulder
Pounding in your temple
Like a bullet in your head
Waiting for release
Your simplistic measures
Your holistic treasures
What you want and what you need
What you feel in your dreams
Been around and fought a lot of wars
Before you could walk
But then again you walked
A lot of miles before you could talk
And now you know that you feel it
What you gonna 
Can you can you 
Feel it, feel it, feel it
Over you, 
Can you can you feel it
Feel it, feel it, over you
Can you can you feel it
Feel it...
