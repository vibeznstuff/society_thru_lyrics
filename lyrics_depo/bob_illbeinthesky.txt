I'll be in the sky
I'll be there
Ooh all right


I'll be in the sky

Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
Yea
I'll be in the sky


Remember when I leave,
That the one in the mirror ain't me,
It's just someone that I call B.O.B,
It's kinda me but it's not,
It's just a mask that I got,
So that I can rap and get off my block,
Reminiscin' my past when I was a toddler,
Sittin in grass and playin with blocks,
Then failing my classes now I'm on lockdown,
Now writin and readin alot,
Money and weed is in my shoe box now,
While I'm tryina get me a glock,
Cause I thought I was at the end of my line,
Then I find out it was all in my mind,
That's why I'm here to end all the fear,
We all gon die and leave from here like

I was a man with no name,
Now I'm attributing mo fame,
But all of this ain't gonna matter when I a die and say good bye so long,
Sayonara I'll have to catch you tomorra' maybe, cause baby,

I'll be in the sky
I'll be there
Ooh all right


I'll be in the sky

Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
Yea
I'll be in the sky


Everybody here gonna die one day,
So while I'm here I'm a find my way,
That's my forte,
That's why I'm here,
Shit to open up your ears,
And speak this real.

Beatin' down your block with the truth,
The gold teeth don't really match with the suit,
Nowadays folk would rather rap than go to school,
Cause they feel that if they black then they gotta have it too,
But ya'll don't really seen that there,
After all everybody wanna kick back,
They wanna sit back,
They wanna sip Goose,
They wanna get down,
They wanna get loose,
They wanna get blown,
They wanna see the truth,
They wanna get old just like you,
But since they ain't nobody gon be responsible,
I'm a gonna have to be the one to show,

I was a man with no name,
Now I'm attributing mo fame,
But all of this ain't gonna matter when I a die and say good bye so long,
Sayonara I'll have to catch you tomorra maybe, cause baby,

I'll be in the sky
I'll be there
Ooh all right


I'll be in the sky

Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
Yea
I'll be in the sky


I'll be there
Ooh all right
I'll be there

I'll be there
Ooh all right
I'll be there

I'll be there
Ooh all right
I'll be there

I'll be there
Ooh all right
I'll be there.
