I need your arms around me,
I need to feel your touch,
I need your understanding, I need your love,
So much, 

You tell me that you love me so,
You tell me that you care,
But when I need you, (BABY)
Baby, (You're never there), 

On the phone,
Long long distance,
Always through such,
Strong resistance, 

When first you say,
You're too busy,
I wonder if you,
Even miss me, 

Never there,
You're never there,
You're never, ever,
Ever ever there, 

A golden bird that flies away,
A candle's fickle flame,
To think I held you yesterday,
Your love was just a game, 

A golden bird that flies away,
A candle's fickle flame,
To think I held you yesterday,
Your love was just a game, 

You tell me that you love me so,
You tell me that you care,
But when I need you, (BABY)
Baby, 

Take the time,
To get to know me,
If you want me,
Why can't you just show me, 

We're always on,
This roller coaster,
If you want me,
Why can't you get closer, 

Never there,
You're never there,
You're never, ever,
Ever ever there, 

Never there,
You're never there,
You're never, ever,
Ever ever there
