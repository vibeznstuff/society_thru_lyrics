If I said you were evil
You'd knock me off my feet
If I said you're a good girl
You'd bore me off my seat
You'll never see me walking
Down a guilty middle-class street
I'm frequently appalled
By them pretending to be poor men

I'd give you all I can now
I don't have enough arms for you
Ask the people with the real cash
Institutions who are taking yours and mine

I won't feel guilty, I won't feel bad
I won't feel guilty, I won't feel bad

It's written in the books
In the literature that I've read
Temporary blindness
Breezing through the fog again
You'll never see me walking
Down a guilty middle-class street
I'm frequently appalled
By them pretending to be poor men

I'd give you all I can now
I don't have enough arms for you
Ask the people with the real cash
Institutions who are taking yours and mine

I won't feel guilty, I won't feel bad
I won't feel guilty, I won't feel bad

I never get enough of it

I won't feel guilty, I won't feel bad
I won't feel guilty, I won't feel bad

Bad Bad Bad!!!
