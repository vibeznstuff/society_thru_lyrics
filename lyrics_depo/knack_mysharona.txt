Hoo, my little pretty one, my pretty one
When you gonna give me some time, Sharona?
Hoo, you make my motor run, my motor run
Gun it comin' off of the line, Sharona

Never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind
I always get it up for the touch of the younger kind
My, my, my, aye-aye, woo!

M-m-m-my Sharona

Come a little closer, huh, a-will ya, huh?
Close enough to look in my eyes, Sharona
Keepin' it a mystery, it gets to me
Runnin' down the length of my thigh, Sharona

Never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind
I always get it up for the touch of the younger kind
My, my, my, aye-aye, woo!

M-m-m-my Sharona
M-m-m-my Sharona (Yeah!)

When you gonna give to me, g-give to me
Is it just a matter of time, Sharona?
Is it d-d-destiny, d-destiny
Or is it just a game in my mind, Sharona?

Never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind
I always get it up for the touch of the younger kind
My, my, my, aye-aye, woo!
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-my, my, my, aye-aye, woo!

M-m-m-my Sharona
M-m-m-my Sharona
M-m-m-my Sharona
M-m-m-my Sharona

Hoooooo-ohhh, my Sharona
Hoooooo-ohhh, my Sharona
Hoooooo-ohhh, my Sharona
