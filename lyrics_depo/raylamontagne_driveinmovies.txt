I spent all my childhood years wishin' that I looked like a Movie-Star
A cigarette behind my ear, leanin' up against a muscle car

Wanna know all the things that I shouldn't know
I got smokes that I stole from the Seven-L
Everybody's at the Drive-In, wanna go?

I wanna be the guy who doesn't like to fight, but who could kick your ass if you
touch his girl
I wanna be the guy who breaks all the rules, but the cops let him off cause they
think he's cool

Wanna know all the things that I shouldn't know
I got smokes that I stole from the Seven-L
Everybody's at the Drive-In, wanna go?

Drive-In Movies
Drive-In Movies

Grew up fast in that Nebraska town, nothin' goin on and even less to do
Mom's at work, and Dad's never around, so me and the guys we're skippin' school

Wanna know all the things that we shouldn't know
We got smokes that we stole from the Seven-L
Everybody's at the Drive-In, wanna go?

Drive-in Movies
Drive-in Movies

I wanna be Brando in the Wild One
I wanna be somethin' to someone
Cause nothin' ever happens in this Town,
The same old crew, hangin' around
Jus' waitin for some shit to go down
But we love our Drive-in Movies

Now I'm grown, kids of my own, I never thought I could be a Dad
Me and my girl, we're goin' strong, still the best friend that I ever had

Now I know all the things that I didn't know
I got smokes, but I buy em' now, I guess I'm old
Drive-in's just an empty lot that no one mows

I miss those Drive-in Movies
I spent all my childhood years, wishin' that I looked like a Movie-Star
