Now that you got it, what you gonna do about it?
Now that you got it, what you gonna do about it?

Now that you got it, what you gonna do about it?

All the stars I was reachin' for you had in the palm of your hand
&amp; if for just once I would let the
padlock on the door be open
Well, dammit, just get on over here
This better be the best thing I ever felt
My days, they better be sunny
It better be nothing but all that I want


Now that I'm your baby, the things you promised me now I want
Now that you got it, what you gonna do about it?
Now that you got it, what you gonna do about it?
If I'm really your baby then share with me your secrets &amp; all
Now that you got it, what you gonna do about it?
What you gonna do about it? What you gonna do about it?

I'm the raddest queen of them all
I could have anyone, so what I want?
Perfect, get it right, never wrong
So you gonna step it up? Or you gonna be gone
Not like the rest (not this), nothing is typical (ain't nothing is typical)
This is not a test (no test), this is a for sure (it's all gotta be for sure)


Now that I'm your baby, the things you promised me now I want
Now that you got it, what you gonna do about it?
Now that you got it, what you gonna do about it?
If I'm really your baby then share with me your secrets &amp; all
Now that you got it, what you gonna do about it?
What you gonna do about it? What you gonna do about it?

(Yo Gwen whatcha make 'em do?)
Well, I'd train him like a marine corps
Boot, camp, make him like a superhero (yes ma'am)
That always better be his response
Or I don't give a dog a bone
Attention! Show me your skeletons, let's not play games
We can be closer than sharing last names (gimme my award)
The award is a purple heart, it could be yours
If you earn that medal, yeah you could be my boy

Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh


If I'm really your baby then share with me your secrets &amp; all
Now that you got it, what you gonna do about it?
What you gonna do about it? What you gonna do about it?
