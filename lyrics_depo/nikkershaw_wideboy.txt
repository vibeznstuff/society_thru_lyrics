He made a record
It made him famous
Yes it made him a star
The life and soul of the party
He rocks, he shocks
You never know where you are with him

He got no sense but he got money
He got no sense but he got overnight success
Exceed excess, exceed excess
He no big deal, he just a wide boy
He no big deal he's just an ordinary guy
Oh me, oh my, oh me, oh my

He made a movie
He played the driver of a big yellow car
He is super fab and groovy
He struts he crows
You never know where you are with him

He got no sense but he got money
He got no sense but he got overnight success
Exceed excess, exceed excess
He no big deal, he just a wide boy
He no big deal he's just an ordinary guy
Oh me, oh my, oh me, oh my

And with your symmetry teeth and your California tan
I'm here to tell you that you ain't no Superman
You just a wide boy

Wide boy
