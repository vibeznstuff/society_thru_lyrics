Gold mouth lady mix a drink for me
Lay beside me a solid company
You move on up, you move on back
Your laser love is like a heart attack
Lean clean woman lay a kiss on me
My love is strong like a raging sea
You move on up, you move on back
Your laser love is like a heart attack
Dance dance dance till the crack of dawn
Dance dance dance till your shoes are worn
You move on up, you move on back
Your laser love is like a heart attack
You move on up, you move on back
Your laser love is like a heart attack
