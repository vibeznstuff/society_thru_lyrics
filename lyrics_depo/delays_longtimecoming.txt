Tore it up and walked away
Why'd you wanna go do that for?
Threw your Lego in 
The lake
Why'd you wanna go do that for?

And you're a long time coming
A long time 
Coming home
Do you see me reeling off the lines
I've seen your, I've seen your 
Eyes

How can you grow old
You were my triumph?
How can you grow old
You were my 
Triumph?

Turned your face into the squall
Why'd you wanna go do that for?
You carved 
Your name into the wall
Why'd you wanna go do that for?

And you're a long time 
Coming
A long time coming home
Do you see me reeling off the lines
I've seen your, I've 
Seen your eyes

How can you grow old
You were my triumph?
How can you grow old
You were 
My triumph?
