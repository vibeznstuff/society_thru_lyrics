I know
that's just the way it goes
and you ain't right
for sure
you turned your back on love
for the last time
it won't take much longer now
time makes me stronger, well
there's nothing more to say

One day in your life
said love would remind you
how could you leave it all behind
one day in your life
it's gonna find you
with the tears that left me cry
and baby I'm stronger then before
you gotta play it on the line
maybe one day in your life

My love
did you think I'd break down
and cry
this thing we had
it mean the world to me
guess I was blind
it won't take much longer now
see time makes me stronger, well
and I know you'll be coming round some day

One day in your life
said love would remind you
how could you leave it all behind
yeah
one day in your life
it's gonna find you
with the tears that left me cry
and baby I'm stronger then before
you gotta play it on the line
maybe one day in your life

You called me in the midnight hour
with your velvet lights
so many sleepless nights, I wonder
is it time to say goodbye?
oooh yeah

One day in your life
said love would remind you
baby
how could you leave it all behind
could you leave it all behind
yeah
one day in your life
it's gonna find you
with the tears that left me cry
and baby I'm stronger then before
you gotta play it on the line
maybe one day in your life

ooooooooone day

One day in your life
said love would remind you
yeah yeah yeah
how could you leave it all behind
oh oh oh yeah
one day in your life
it's gonna find you
with the tears that left me cry
and baby I'm stronger then before
you gotta play it on the line
maybe one day in your life
