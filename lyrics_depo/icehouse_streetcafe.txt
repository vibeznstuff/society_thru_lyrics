If there were no tomorrows
If there was just one more chance
I'd take it again
You know I'd take it again
You turn and it's gone forever
In time you forget
You know that's love
It's only love
And no matter where the days have left you
Every day ends at the street cafe
The street cafe
And no matter where the road may take you
Every time it brings you back to the street cafe
It's where you have to be
Well the people may come and go but
Here the street and the scene is just
The way that it was
The way that it was
No nothing will ever change here
Maybe a smile reminds you
Now and again
You wonder now and again
When another night will take you nowhere
You go down to the street cafe
And any time you know the crowd can hide you
The days end at the street cafe
Yeah the street cafe
You turn and it's gone forever
In time you forget
You know that's love
You know it's only love
But no matter where the days have left you
Every day ends at the street cafe
The street cafe
And no matter where the road may take you
Every time it brings you back to the street cafe
Yeah the street cafe
Oh no no no
No matter where the road may take you
We'll meet again someday
You know we'll meet someday
Someday at the street cafe
