Have you seen a mother
Kiss her son goodbye.
Have you seen a dark cloud?
Fly so high.
I have seen a loved one
Telling me lies

Promise like a boomerang
A feeling deep inside.

They not know
What to think about you.
You don't know
What to think about me.
They not know
What to think about me

But if we really feel...

We are ali-i-i-ve...
Take a break
We are ali-i-i-ve...
Take a deep breath
We are ali-i-i-ve...
Take a break
We are ali-i-i-ve...
Take a deep breath

We're alive

Put me on an aeroplane
Let's fly up to the sky
Help me, love will be
The foolest game to get me high.
Let's drown out this highway,
Give out free champagne.
Let this twist and wanna love you so,
Here we go.

You don't know
What to think about me.
I don't know
What to think about you.
You don't know
What to think about me.

But let's enjoy the view...

We are ali-i-i-ve...
Take a break
We are ali-i-i-ve...
Take a deep breath
We are ali-i-i-ve...
Take a break
We are ali-i-i-ve...
Take a deep breath

Don't take yourself too seriously.
Relax, release the heat

We may wear different clothes,
Pray to God, different robes.

But we're not alone.

We are alive...

We are ali-i-i-ve...
Take a break
We are ali-i-i-ve...
Take a deep breath
We are ali-i-i-ve...
We are alive, we're alive yeah
We are ali-i-i-ve
We are alive
We are alive
Take a deep breath
Take a deep breath
Take a deep breath
Take a deep breath
