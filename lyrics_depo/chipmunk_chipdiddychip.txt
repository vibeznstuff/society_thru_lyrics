Dear, I love music baby
There goes the kiss because shes my lady
But everybody wants to try me lately
So I'm eazin of the bus n peddle biking lately
See music it brings me haters
Haters got wifeys they bring me papers
And the mummys do love these MC
So the apple doesnt fall to far from the tree
I'm movin up so I'm celebratin
The girls of the brain but I'm educated
Thanks for always I'm elevatin
So me n roll hype get segregating
I live a love with a best it's blatent
Ma watch sed ther ain't time for haters
So if u look for trouble no I ain't into that
I'm just a cool dude out for papers

Ah haaah
My names chip diddy chip
I don't ever tolerate lip diddy lip
I don't play around I'm just trying to do ma music
But say the wrong thing n I'll flip diddy flip
Some say it's luck but I don't give a shit
Wave to ma haters like see you at the top
I'm the best in the bizz rite next to the kid
Everybody say ma name now Chip Diddy Chip

There like chips hes a swagger done
Enoys the haters like a tag along
E2 cause he noes I'm not havin none
If your cool I'm cool we can get along
Diferent day same issue you no what I'm on
No one ain't eatin if chippy ain't gettin none
They can have half a pie if I'm gettin one
But once iv ate mine everybodys getin sum
Cause u no just how I stay
If you help me eat mine you get paid
A new law over time you no what they say
Chipmunks to cold no you don't say

I drink tea like music pays
It's like more more money more haters hate
I'm in the studio from day to day
It's like work work work they can't knock the raise
A clever man tryd bumpin me
But ain't stupid you can count ma ass

Yo class let me have your attention
Settle down everyone to thier seats
Calm down, calm down, calm down
I've got your test results
Some of you hace done very well
You with the bunches straight A star
Some of you have done very badly
Rech 32 out of a 100 son
Chipmunk what have you got to say for your self

I don't watch face but everybodys flockin me
Yes I am chipmunk there's no other me
See me n it look like I'm talkin to my self
Look I'm only spittin bars man please don't bother me
Once a son ain't nobody hot for me
Past the moon ain't a star that's the other me
The other stars make room
When I'm coming through beside bars
I'm in controll of the galaxy
I don't play no games so don't challenge me
These youths are just nokin ma salary
I love bars like I need more calouries
It's kinder garden anz same ain't ready for the paroply
Ye look the stars ere plz
Ps give me a drum roll please
