Trying to forget the thrill of holding you
Will I ever stop thinking of happiness we knew
Who are you thinking of in your dreams at night
Who are you longing for when you hug your pillow tight.

But I'll forget, I'll forget, 
I know I will
Maybe I will find a heart 
That's true and a love that's real.

Trying to forget the times you broke my heart
Remembering how happy you made me at the start
Please won't you listen I want you to know though you 
have hurt me I still love you so...
