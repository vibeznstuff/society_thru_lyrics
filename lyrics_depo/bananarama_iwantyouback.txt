The room has suddenly grown cold 
And outside in the street it's raining 
You packed your bags and said goodbye 
You took my heart without explaining 

How could you go 
How could you go 
We had a love most people never know 
Ooh stop before you break my heart 

I want you back, don't care what I have to do 
I want you back back back
I want you back, gotta get it through to you 
I want you back back back

If I can make you see 
Only you can fill the need in me 
If you walk away 
You'll regret it some day 
Please stay 

This room is full of memories and 
Shadows of the past remind me 
Of all the love I gave in vain and 
All the hurt I feel inside me 

I want you back 
I want you back 
We had a love most people never know 
Ooh stop before you break my heart 

I want you back, don't care what I have to do 
I want you back back back
I want you back, gotta get it through to you 
I want you back back back

If I can make you see 
Only you can fill the need in me 
If you walk away 
You'll regret it some day 
Please stay 

I want you back
I, I want you back

I want you back
I, I want you
I want you back
We had a love most people never know 
Ooh stop before you break my heart

I want you back, don't care what I have to do 
I want you back back back 
I want you back, gotta get it through to you 
I want you back back back

If I can make you see 
Only you can fill the need in me 
If you walk away 
You'll regret it some day 
Please stay 

I want you back, don't care what I have to do 
I want you back back back 
I want you back, gotta get it through to you 
I want you back back back
