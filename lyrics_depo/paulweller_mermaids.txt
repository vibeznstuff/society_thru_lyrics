She's in my head
She's in my mind
And I'm all she says
Yes she knows me well
As well as you can
She's on my side
I often hide
In her magic hair
And there I learn again - the joy of life
The wonder of it all
And this I feel - that through her I learn
Another way to be

You take my breath, I feel consumed
Take it all - I want to know
What lies behind - your smiles and shells
Wish I knew you well

Come in my head
Come in my mind
You can only love, when you open up
To be yourself
