I saw you talking on the phone,
And know that you were not alone.
But you're stealing my heart away,
Yeah you're stealing my heart away.


You're acting like you're on your own,
But I saw you standing with a girl (hmmm)
Stop tryin' to steal my heart away
Stop tryin' to steal my heart away


I don't know where we going
I don't know who we are


I can feel your heartbeat
I can feel your heartbeat (he said to me)
I can feel your heartbeat (running through me)
Feel your heartbeat
(She said:)

I can feel your heartbeat (she said to me)
I can feel your heartbeat (she said to me)
I can feel your heartbeat (running through me)
Your heartbeat, feel your heartbeat


Maybe it's the way you move,
You got me dreaming like a fool.
That I could steal your heart away,
I could steal your heart away.


No matter what it is you think
I'm not the kind of girl to blink,
And give my heart away
Stop trying to steal my heart away


I don't know where we going
I don't know who we are


I can feel your heartbeat (he said to me)
I can feel your heartbeat (he said to me)
I can feel your heartbeat (running through me)
Your heartbeat
Feel your heartbeat
(She said:)

I can feel your heartbeat (she said to me)
I can feel your heartbeat (she said to me)
I can feel your heartbeat (running through me)
(Feel your heartbeat)


Stop stealing my heart away
Stop stealing my heart away
Stop stealing my heart away
You're stealing my heart away


I don't know where we're going
I don't know who we are
It feels like we are flowing
High above the stars (stars, the stars, the stars, the stars...)

Ooooooo;
Ooooooo

Heartbeat, heart-heartbeat


I can feel it, I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it, I can f..


I can feel your heartbeat (he said to me)
I can feel your heartbeat (he said to me)
I can feel your heartbeat (running through me)
Your heartbeat
Feel your heartbeat
(She said:)

I can feel your heartbeat (she said to me)
I can feel your heartbeat (she said to me)
I can feel your heartbeat (running through me)
(Your heartbeat, feel your heartbeat-beat-beat)


Stop stealing my heart away (Just tell it to me girl)
Stop stealing my heart away (Ooo) (Give it to me boy)
Stop stealing my heart away (Just say it to me girl)
You're stealing my heart away

Stop stealing my heart away (I can feel your heartbeat)
Stop stealing my heart away (I can feel your heartbeat)
Stop stealing my heart away (I can feel your heartbeat)
Your heartbeat, your heartbeat.
