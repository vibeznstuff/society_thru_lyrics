So, there was this DJ
He was like, kicking off
I don't know what he was doing
But it was sick, man
Like, he was like, hands in the air, like, penis out, like fucking
So, like, this clown started covering us in silly string
And we were all like, writhing around on the floor, at least I thought we were
And then this cat walked in, you know, not like a cat, like a feline cat, like a real, like, you know, like, you know what I'm saying dawg?
Like cats and dogs
It was raining, it wasn't raining, we were raving
I ate her, man
Not like eight, like nine
Like, I ate her she was fine, man
Like, you know, like, eatin' and sleepin' and ravin' repeatin', you know.
There were people dancing I think, or maybe they were cops
I think they might of been cops
Well, anyway, like, I was just dancing and dancing,
Oh, no, they were cops
Shit
And this fucking cop just looked at me
And I don't know whether he was really saying it, but all he kept saying was

Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat


Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat,
Sleep,
Rave,
Repeat.


Suddenly I think I'm on the phone
Suddenly I think I'm telling a story,
But I'm not
I'm just dancing,
I'm just dancing,
I'm just sleepin'
I'm just eatin'
I'm just ravin'
I'm just repeatin'
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
I felt this thud, it was a bassline, like, boom fucking boom, man
Sorry dude, I thought you were a object
I went into this diner, and the guy was, like, fucking you wanna buy something?
I'm like no, I'm just dancing to the hum of your fridge
He's like then get the fuck out of my restaurant,
I'm like, I like it here, I like the lighting
Besides I like your waitress, she looks pretty hot
So I got her by the arm, and I dragged her onto the street, and I gave her to the homeless guy
He gave me all his crack
And all he kept saying was


Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat


'Til like John called me the next morning,
Dude, like, where were you last night?
I was like, I was there
He was like, oh, yeah
And then he was like, fucking, remember that tune they were playing?
I'm like, I don't remember fucking anything, man
I mean, I have like, vague recollections and like, a general feeling of happiness
And he was like, no that fucking song, man!


Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat


Eat,
Sleep,
Rave,
Repeat


So I came out of the club, there was dark, and there was night and there were street lamps
I was pretty, like, I dunno
So I went in to this diner and I ordered some food, and suddenly it was tomorrow and then tomorrow was today,
And then I found this club and I went into the club and the club was banging and the music was like, really loud, I was ravin' and suddenly I was savin' this girl from this dude and suddenly he was being rude and all she kept saying was
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
All she kept saying was
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
All they kept saying was
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
All I kept thinking was
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat


She said yo, I'm a artist
And then she just started
To make this thing out of cocaine,
And I swear to god it said

Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat

Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
