Sitting in the sun waiting for a senorita to show,
He just playing melodies from Spain and Mexico,
Soft wind blowing the smell of sweet roses to, each and every one,
Happy to be on an island in the sun,

Mothers with their children waiting in the cool of the shade,
And thirsty be por coming from the fields to drink, tea and lemonade,
Old man urging, his days going, his, working days done,
He's happy to be on an island in the sun,

All the stars come out and shine so bright,
It's so romantic to be in that moon leads paradise,
Love is going to shine a welcoming light when I,
Looking to the eyes of the senorita tonight,

Sitting in the sun waiting for a senorita to show,
He just playing melodies from Spain and Mexico,
Soft wind blowing the smell of sweet roses to, each and every one,
Happy to be on an island in the sun,

Happy to be on an island in the sun,
La la la la la la...
