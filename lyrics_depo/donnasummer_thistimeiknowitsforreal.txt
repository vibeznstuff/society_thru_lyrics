What would I have to do
To get you to notice me too
Do I
Stand in line
One of a million
Admiring eyes

Walk a tightrope way up high
Write your name across the sky

I'm going crazy just to let you know
You'd be amazed how much I love you so baby
When I get my hands on you I won't let go
This time I know it's for real

Should I write or call your home
Shout it out with a megaphone
Radio, TV news
Got to find a way
To get my message to you

To say I love you with a neon sign
Anything to make you mine

I'm going crazy just to let you know
If I wait too long for you I might explode baby
I've been around the block enough to know
That this time I know it's for real

Oh baby
This time, this time, this time, this time
Oh baby
This time, this time

Walk a tightrope way up high
Write your name across the sky

I'm going crazy just to let you know
You'd be amazed how much I love you so baby
When I get my hands on you I won't let go
This time I know it's for real

I'm going crazy just to let you know
If I waited too long for you I might explode baby
I've been around the block enough to know
That this time I know it's for real
