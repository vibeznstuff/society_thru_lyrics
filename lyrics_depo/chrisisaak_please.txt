I keep listening, very quietly.
You're discussing, your philosophy.
There's a long list, of what's wrong with me.
And you go on talking endlessly.... now

What's the problem?
What's the question?
What's the answer?
Where's this heading?

You keep talking.
Where's it going?
If there's an answer I don't know it...

Please
You're killing me.
Please
You're killing me with all these questions.

I've been trying to get along with you.
Doesn't matter what I try to do.
Once you start in
there's no stopping you... now

What's the problem?
What's the question?
What's the answer?
Where's this heading?

You keep talking.
Where's it going?
If there's an answer I don't know it...

Please
You're killing me.
Please
You're killing me with all these questions.

You're explaining, very patiently.
I'm a problem, what to do with me.
I keep listening, but i just don't see now.

What's the problem?
What's the question?
What's the answer?
Where's this heading?

You keep talking.
Where's it going?
If there's an answer I don't know it...

Please
You're killing me.
Please
You're killing me with all these questions.
Please, Please, Please
Please, Please
You're killing me.
You're killing me
