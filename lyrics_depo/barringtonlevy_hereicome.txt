On the intercom, Rosie tell me to come
Cause she didn't have a daughter

She said the lift doesn't run
Run up the stairs and come

You not gonna see your son
So I grab a bunch of roses
And I started to run

Two months later she said come and get your son
Cause I don't want your baby to come tie me down
