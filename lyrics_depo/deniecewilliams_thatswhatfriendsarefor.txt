While you're gone boy
Do you wonder how I spend my day
Thinkin' 'bout you
And maybe in a special way
I can show you how I miss you more and more
'Cause after all
That's what friends are for

Are you tired?
Do you think that you would like to nap?
By the fire
I will hold you gently in my lap
And I'll count the minutes till you sleep no more
Cause after all
That's what friends are for

All I want to do
Is to make life a little better for you
So I try so hard to keep what's ours together
There never could be
Another for me

Are you hungry?
Think that you could use some wine
And the music takes you
Have a certain thing in mind
Dinner, wine and music starts to bore
Fluff the pillows on the floor and more
'Cause after all
That's what friends are for
'Cause after all
That's what friends are for
