I heard you saw her last night
at that dive down in Jamestown
I haven't seen her since the 4th of July
Did you get a chance to talk, did she mention me at all
Was she there alone or with some other guy

Well, I'm dying to know 
but I'm scared of the truth
So before you say a word
Consider what this heart's been through, and

And lie - don't tell me that she looked amazing
Just lie - if she's with someone else I just can't take it
Tell me she looked sad and lonely
Tell me she's been missing me like crazy
Yeah, just look me in the eye and lie

Was she over by the jukebox
playing songs we used to dance to
Staring at the door sipping makers on the rocks
Did she ask you where I've been
Was she hoping I'd walk in
Just take her by the hand
and pick up right where we left off

Well, I know shes moving on and its killing me to see
And the words you want to say are strong enough to be the death of me, 

So lie - don't tell me that she looked amazing
Just lie - if she's with someone else I just can't take it
Tell me she looked sad and lonely
Tell me she's been missing me like crazy
Yeah, just look me in the eye and lie

Cause I cant throw away the dreams we've shared
Ive tried reaching out but she don't care
It's pretty clear, but I ain't ready to let go,

So lie - don't tell me that she looked amazing
Just lie - if she's with someone else
then lie - don't tell me that she looked amazing
Just Lie - if she's with someone else I just can't take it
Tell me she looked sad and lonely
Tell me she's been missing me like crazy
Yeah, just look me in the eye and lie
