You keep telling me you want me
Hold me close all through the night
I know!! that deep inside you need me
No one else can make it right
Don't you try to hide the secret
I can see it in your eyes
You said the words without speaking
Now I'm gonna make you mine!

Give me just one night, una noche!
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, una noche!
I'll give you the time of your life!
(the time of you life, ooooh)
(I'll give you the time of your life)
(oooh baby yeah!)

Your eyes of passion make me crazy
Your existence makes me wild
I wanna loosen up your feelings
see what's hiding inside

Just give me one night, una noche!
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, una noche!
I'll give you the time of your life
(the time of your life oooooh ooh yeah)
(oooh baby)

Aye que rico  
me pone loca  
como te mueves  
como me toca  
tu movimiento  
tu sentimiento  
si yo te quiero  
te doy la noche  
toda la noche  
Aye, vamos!  

Give me just one night!
(Give me one night baby)
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night
(Ahh Just one night ohh baby)
I'll give you the time of your life
(I'll give you the time of your life)
Give me just one night

Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side
(A moment to be by your side)
Give me just one night, una noche (ohh yeah)
I'll give you the time of your life

(Come on come on come on now baby)

Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side
(A moment to be by your side)
Give me just one night, una noche
I'll give you the time of your life
