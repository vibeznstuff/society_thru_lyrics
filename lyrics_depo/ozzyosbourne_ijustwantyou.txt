There Are No Unwinnable Wars
There Are No Unrightable Wrongs
Or Unsingable Songs

There Are No Unbeatable Odds
There Are No Believable Gods
There Are No Unnameable Names,
Shall I Say It Again, Yeah

There Are No Impossible Dreams
There Are No Invisible Seams
Each Night When Day Is Through
I Don't Ask Much

I Just Want You
I Just Want You

There Are No Uncriminal Crimes
There Are No Unrhymable Rhymes
There Are No Identical Twins
Or Forgivable Sins

There Are No Incurable Ills
There Are No Unkillable Thrills
One Thing And You Know It's True
I Don't Ask Much

I Just Want You
I Just Want You
I Just Want You
I Just Want You

I'm Sick And Tired Of Bein' Sick And Tired
I Used To Go To Bed So High And Wired
Yeah  - Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I Think I'll Buy Myself Some Plastic Water
I Guess I Should Have Married Lennon's Daughter

There Are No Unachievable Goals
There Are No Unsaveable Souls
No Legitimate Kings Or Queens,
Do You Know What I Mean? Yeah

There Are No Undisputable Truths
And There Ain't No Fountain Of Youth
Each Night When Day Is Through
I Don't Ask Much

I Just Want You 
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I Just Want You
I Just Want You
Hey, Yeah,
I Just Want You

I Just Want You,
Hey
I Just Want You
