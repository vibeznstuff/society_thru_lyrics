Oww!
(Ahh)

Friends say it's fine, friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
Yeah!
I move like a cat, charge like a ram
Sting like a bee, babe, I wanna be your man, hey!

Well, it's plain to see you were meant for me, yeah
I'm your boy, your 20th century toy
Yeah!

Friends say it's fine, my friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
Fly like a plane, drive like a car
Bawl like a hound, babe, I wanna be your man, hoo!

Well, it's plain to see you were meant for me
And I'm your toy, your 20th century boy

20th century toy, I wanna be your boy-ah
20th century toy, I wanna be your boy
20th century toy, I wanna be your boy
20th century toy, I wanna be your boy

Friends say it's fine, friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood, nah, nah
Move like a cat, charge like a ram
Sting like a bee 
Oh, oh, babe, I wanna be your man
And, um, and, oh, oh

Well it's plain to see you were meant for me
And I'm your toy, your 20th century boy

20th century toy, I wanna be your boy
20th century toy, I wanna be your boy
20th century toy, I wanna be your toy
20th century boy-ah, I wanna be your toy

Yeah-ah
Ah, oh, oh, yeah
My friends say it's fine, they say it's good
I don't believe it's like Robin Hood
I'm like a car, I drive like a plane
I wanna hang your head in the falling rain
Ah, oh yeah
Wow!
