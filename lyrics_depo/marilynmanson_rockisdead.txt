All simple monkeys with alien babies 
Amphetamines for boys 
Crucifixes for ladies 
Sampled and soulless 
Worldwide and real webbed 
You sell all the living 
For more safer dead 

Anything to belong 


Rock is deader than dead 
Shock is all in your head 
Your sex and your dope is all that were fed 
So fuck all your protests and put them to bed 

God is in the T.V. 

1,000 mothers are praying for it 
We're so full of hope 
And so full of shit 
Build a new god to medicate and to ape 
Sell us ersatz dressed up and real fake 

Anything to belong 

Rock is deader than dead



God is in the T.V.
