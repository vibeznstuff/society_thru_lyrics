Just one step at a time 
And closer to destiny 
I knew at a glance 
There'd always be a chance for me 
With someone I could live for 
Nowhere I would rather be 

Is your love strong enough 
Like a rock in the sea 
Am I asking too much 
Is your love strong enough? 

Just one beat of your heart 
And stranger than fantasy 
I knew from the start 
It had to be the place for me 
Someone that I would die for 
There's no way I could ever leave 

Is your love strong enough 
Like a rock in the sea 
Am I asking too much 
Is your love strong enough? 

Is your love strong enough? 
Just one beat of your heart 
Is your love strong enough? 
Is your love strong enough? 
Is your love strong enough? 
Is your love strong enough? 
Is your love strong enough? 

Just one beat of your heart 
Strong enough? 
Strong enough? 
Just one beat of your heart 
Strong enough? 
Strong enough? 
Just one beat of your heart 
Strong enough? 
Strong enough? 
Just one beat of your heart 
Strong enough? 
Strong enough? 
Just one beat of your heart 
Strong enough? 
Strong enough? 
Just one beat of your heart
