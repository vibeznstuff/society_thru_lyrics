You been showing me signs
You been blowing me kisses
You been trying to be mine
Girl, I'm down if you're with it
But you know I got a girl
And I know you got a man
But there's one thing you need to understand
I don't give a damn about how he feels
You shouldn't give a damn about how she feels
'Cause you and me know what we got is real
So we should quit playing, and close the deal

Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it
And you know that I like it I like it I like it
Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it
And you know that I like it I like it I like it

So I'ma get what I want
I ain't worried about nobody but you, girl
Come and get what you want
Ain’t no need to fight it at all

Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it
And you know that I like it I like it I like it
Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it
And you know that I like it I like it I like it

I like the way you comb your hair
I like those stylish clothes you wear
It's just the little things you do
That show how much you really care

My girl she been playing them games
And you been dealing with a lame
We both be feeling the same
Fuck what she saying, fuck what he saying
Swerving, switching lanes.
Stead on up to the bank,
Counting the money we make.

Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it
And you know that I like it I like it I like it
Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it
And you know that I like it I like it I like it

So I'ma get what, I want
I ain't worried about nobody but you, girl
Come and get what you want
Ain’t no need to fight it all

Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it
And you know that I like it I like it I like it
Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it
And you know that I like it I like it I like it

I like the way you comb your hair
I like those stylish clothes you wear
It's just the little things you do
That show how much you really care

Even though you got you someone
And I got someone
I can give you more, more
I can't stop thinking about you
Girl I want you
Tell me, am I wrong, wrong?
Girl, Cause I been hoping, I been praying, I been wishing
That you say you love me, are you loving this decision
Girl I know you like it, and I like it
Let's not wait no more.

So I'ma get what, I want
I ain't worried about nobody but you, girl
Come and get what you want
Ain’t no need to fight it all

Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it
And you know that I like it I like it I like it
Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it
And you know that I like it I like it I like it

You know I like it
