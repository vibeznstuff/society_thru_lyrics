You twisted a nerve you, put your hand on your heart. 
You said 'hey don't worry, you're fit woman, that's all that counts now'
I ignored all the usual signs, not really knowing quite why. 
Let you decide yeah, aint it funny how I'm finding out now,
It makes me laugh how I let you have your way and your say,
I've got it now, so I'm asking you babe, 
Did I ever even cross your mind? 
Cause it's not a game of who is under the thumb, 
I think you took me for a ride,
But I didn't see, 
I didn't even realise, boy, that we were playing games of under the thumb, 
I think you took me for a ride, 
What a waste of me, oh oh oh.
A pro at the sweet talk, back into your bedroom again like, 
A fool I went blindly as soon as I got the invite, yes. 
I ignored all the usual signs, 
Swallowed it down with my pride, 
Let you decide, yeah, aint it funny how I'm finding out now, 
It makes me laugh how I let you have you say and your way, 
I've got it now, so I'm asking you babe, 
Did I ever even cross your mind?
Cause its not a game of who is under the thumb, 
I think you took me for a ride, 
But I didn't see, 
I didn't even realise, boy, that we were playing games of under the thumb, 
I think you took me for a ride, 
What a waste of me, oh oh oh.
What a waste of me, oh oh oh.
Boy I thought you were for real, 
So I could give you more, 
But now I want you on your knees begging on the floor.
Did I ever even cross your mind?
Cause its not a game of who is under the thumb, 
I think you took me for a ride, 
But I didn't see, 
I didn't even realise (didn't even realise), boy, that we were playing games of under the thumb, 
I think you took me for a ride, 
What a waste of me, yeah.
Did I ever even cross your mind?
Cause its not a game of who is under the thumb, 
I think you took me for a ride, 
But I didn't see, 
I didn't even realise, boy, that we were playing games of under the thumb, 
I think you took me for a ride, 
What a waste of me, oh oh oh.
