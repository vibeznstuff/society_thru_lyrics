Better run for cover
You're a hurricane full of lies
And the way you're heading
No one's getting out alive

So do us all a favor
Would you find somebody else to blame
'Cause your words are like bullets and I'm the way your weapons aim


I guess I could fill a book with things that I don't know about you baby
You're not misunderstood but you got
You got to go


(Lies)

Living in a fantasy

(Lies)

Don't even know reality

(Lies)

When you start talking I start walking

(Lies)

Lies
Lies
Lies


Don't even wanna know the truth

(Lies)

The devil has his eye on you girl

(Lies)

When you start talking I start walking

(Lies)

Lies
Lies
Lies

Yeah, Yeah

So don't forget your seatbelt
Don't you think of picking up the phone
Better say your prayers 'cause you're never gonna make it home

Did you miss the stop sign
That last decision was your last
'Cause you can't come back once you're lying in the broken glass


And I hope you get to hear me say, "Who gets the last laugh now"

No more excuses
No more running
Only God can save you now
(God can save you now)
'Cause I know the truth
Time is running out




And I'm just one drink away
And I'm back in Wonderland like it was yesterday
And I hope you get to hear me say, "Who gets the last"
"Who gets the last"
"Who gets the last laugh now"
