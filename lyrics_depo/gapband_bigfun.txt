If you want my love
Come and get it
Girl

And if you want me for a toy
Do I have a choice?
I don't know! 
If you want my love
Come and get it
Girl

And if you want to be my friend through thick and thin

You can fill in
That's no sin
Having big fun.

Because I'm gonna love you
Each and every day

No more work
Just a lot of play

Having big fun under the sun.
