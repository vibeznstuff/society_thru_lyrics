It's in your eyes, a color fade out
Looks like a new transition
The starting up and shaking your ground
Turning your head to see a new day calling

Does it feel like a head to lean on?
A snapshot from where you were born
I'm looking for your hand in the rough
You're caught in the wire
Well, I'll lift you up

Leading on the action
Caught in a cell phone's rays
Bleeding on a sofa
Staring at the wayside
He's coming and she knows it
Even though she knows why
Footsteps in the hallway
Girl, you haven't got time

You gotta get out
Go far away
You gotta get out
Go far away

Darkness in the bedroom
Maybe she is resting up
Maybe she was outraged
Just come back from the club
I can't hear her breathing
Something doesn't seem right
Killer in the hallway
We're living on a set time

We gotta get out
Go far away
We gotta get out
Go far away
