I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow where you be

And I'm wishing on all the rainbows that I see
Wishing on all the people, uh, we've been
And I'm wishing on tomorrow, when it'll come
And I'm wishing on all the lovin' we've ever done

I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I never thought I'd see
A time when you would be

So far away from home
So far away from me

Just think of all the moments that we'd spent
I just can't let you go, from me you were meant
I didn't me to hurt you and I know
That in the game of love you reap what you sow

I feel it's time for us to make up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh, baby
When we're together, oh, whether or never

I feel it's time for us to make up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh, baby
When we're together, yeahhhh... whether or never

And I'm wishing on a star...


And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
Wishing on all the people,uh, we've ever been
And I'm wishing on tomorrow, when it'll come
And I'm wishing on all the lovin' we've ever done

And I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are (oh rich out)
(I'm) wishing on a dream
To follow where you be

I'm wishing on a star...
