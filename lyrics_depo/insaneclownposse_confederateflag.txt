I'm in an old station wagon deep in alabama
Wipe the sweat outta my eyes, cocked the hammer

I see a pickup truck with a rebel flag window
A skinny redneck with one of his kinfolk
I pull up along side and blast the passenger
Blood, feathers and bone, a massacre
I kept shootin, hit the driver
He fell on the horn stuck
Threw a molotov cocktail and blew up the truck


I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
Out here pretending like you ain't offendin'
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
You redneck judges with racist grudges
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
If you gotta tattoo, I'm aimin' at you
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
You get punched in your faces reppin' the racists

Confederate Flag
F-f-f-f-fuck you
Confederate Flag
f-fuck you-f-f-fuck you
Confederate Flag
F-f-f-f-f-fuck you
Confederate Flag
f-f-fuck you, fuck you


The judge, grandpa, dad and three sons
All of em' KKK, they can't run
I blew the hair clean off and both still in the hood
The headless horseman fell dead in the woods
The rest of the clans man ran cause' they were scarey
It was Tim the baker and the bar bellary
They all pussies, threw off there hoods and cried please
But they were devils, so I capped their knees


I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
That shit represents, a hateful sense
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
If it's in your back pockets, I'm aimin' my rockets
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
That's what you wanna wave? I stick you in your grave
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
Stick your fucking flag pole right up your fag hole

Confederate Flag
F-f-f-f-fuck you
Confederate Flag
f-fuck you-f-f-fuck you
Confederate Flag
F-f-f-f-f-fuck you
Confederate Flag
f-f-fuck you, fuck you


Rednecks call it pride
Pride for what?
White pride for slavery it sickens my gut
I see that flag as a challenge that you want to fight
You don't care who it offends
You say it's your right
Well it's my right to sock you dead in your lip
Put a foot on your neck, until you eat up a dick (bitch)
No matter where you live, you should hate that flag
'Cause it represents evil bigots, tell em' shaggs


One, two, three rednecks on a ladder
Hangin' up a rebel flag
It don't matter how many of ya
Because we don't love ya
Stick you in the dirt, tombstone above ya
It's juggalos all over the south, that don't wave it
Proud of where they're from but that flag, they hate it
Cause they understand it's a symbol of slavery
One flag reps us all, it means bravery


I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
I turn a redneck into a deadneck
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
Cut the head off a chicken, get from an ass kickin'
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
The holes in your t-shirt, fill them with pee squirt
I SAY FUCK YOUR REBEL FLAG
Redneck fuckin' meth head, tuck you in your death bed

Confederate Flag
F-f-f-f-fuck you
Confederate Flag
f-fuck you-f-f-fuck you
Confederate Flag
F-f-f-f-f-fuck you
Confederate Flag
f-f-fuck you, fuck you
