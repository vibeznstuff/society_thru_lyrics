Changing Your Strut When You Know I'm Behind You
Changing Your Ways Cause You Don't Know What To Do
I Only Wanna Tell You
How I Feel Inside
If Only You Could Listen
Try To Change Your Mind

So I Walk Right Up To You
And You Walk All Over Me
And I Ask You What You Want
And You Tell Me What You Need
Can't You Feel It All Come Down
Can't You Hear It All Around
At The Place Where Lost Is Found
That Great Love Sound

Talking To You Makes Me Wanna Shake And Shout
Touching You Makes Me Wanna Come Right Out
You Could Never Want Me
The Same Way I Want You
I'm Love Tornado Struck
I Don't Know What To Do
