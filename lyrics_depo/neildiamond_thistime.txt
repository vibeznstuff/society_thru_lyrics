If there was time enough for me
To do it all, again
I promise you, that I would find
A way to make it right,
This time

This time I'd love you even more
I never thought, I could
But now I know, that I would find
A way to make it right
This time

Over again, I closed my eyes,
And I keep reliving it over again
It's over but then
I've got my dream
Don't no one dare tell me no

And you'd be mine this time for sure
Only got to show I care the way I do
And I'd be there this time for you.

If there was time enough to say
The things I feel inside
I promise you, I'd find a way
A way to say them right
This time

Over again, I closed my eyes
And I keep reliving it
Over again
It's over but then
I've got my dream
Don't no one dare tell me no

And I'll be there this time for sure
'Cause I'm not the same man
That I was before
And I'm nothing at all
If I'm not yours
I only got to show I care the way I do
And I'll be there this time for you
Yes, I'll be there this time for you
