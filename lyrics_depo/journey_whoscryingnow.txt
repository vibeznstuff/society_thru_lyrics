It's been a mystery
And still they try to see
Why somethin' good can hurt so bad
Caught on a one-way streets
The taste of bittersweet
Love will survive somehow, some way

One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
Wonder who's cryin' now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
Wonder who's cryin' now

So many stormy nights
So many wrongs or rights
Neither could change
Their headstrong ways
And in a lover's rage
They tore another page
The fightin' is worth
The love they save

One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
Wonder who's cryin' now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
Wonder who's cryin' now

Only so many tears you can cry
'Til the heartache is over
And now you can say your love
Will never die

Whoooooa-oh-whoa
Whoooa-oh
Ooooooh-whoa, ooh-whooa

One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
Wonder who's cryin' now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
Wonder who's cryin' now
