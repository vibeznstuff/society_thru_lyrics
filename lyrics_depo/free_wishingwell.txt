Take off your hat
Kick off your shoes,
I know you ain't going anywhere.
Run 'round the town
Singing your blues
I know you ain't going anywhere.

You have always been
A good friend of mine
But you're always saying farewell
And the only time that you are satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well.

Throw down your gun
You might shoot yourself,
Or is that what you are tryin' to do,
Put up a fight
You believe to be right
And someday the sun will shine through.

You have always got
Something to hide
Something you just can't tell
And the only time that you are satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well.

Oh!
But I know what you're wishing for
Love and a peaceful world
Yeah
Love and a peaceful world
Oh! Yeah
Love and a peaceful world

You have always been
A good friend of mine
But you're always saying farewell
And the only time that you are satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing....well.

Yes
I wish you well
I wish you well
Everybody has a wish
Everybody has a dream
I wish you well.
