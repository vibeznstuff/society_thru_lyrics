We don't like you, we just want to try you
I'm tired of runnin', the feeling ain't comin'
This all could be simpler, it all could be simpler
But all this is sickness, the feeling ain't in this

We don't know where to stop
We don't know where to stop
I try and I try, but I can't get enough
I won't fail you, but you won't bleed for me

Have I been sinful, have I been sinful
It's all been nothin', you're good ain't for nothin'
It's hard not to die when your time has been killed off
But I have been grateful you know this could take hold

We don't know where to stop
We don't know where to stop
I try and I try, but I can't get enough
I won't fail you, but you won't bleed for me

Try keep your head up high
Time burns so deep inside you 
Rips your throat out

We don't like you, we just want to try you
I'm tired of runnin', the feeling ain't comin'
This all could be different, it all could be different
But all this is sickness, the feeling ain't in this

We don't know where to stop
We don't know where to stop
I try and I try, but I can't get enough
I won't fail you, but you won't bleed for me
