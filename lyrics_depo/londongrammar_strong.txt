Excuse me for a while
While I'm wide-eyed
And I'm so damn caught in the middle
I've excused you for a while
While I'm wide-eyed
And I'm so damn caught in the middle

And a lion, a lion roars would you not listen?
If a child, a child cries would you not forgive them?

Yeah, I might seem so strong
Yeah, I might speak so long
I've never been so wrong
Yeah, I might seem so strong
Yeah, I might speak so long
I've never been so wrong

Excuse me for a while,
Turn a blind eye
With a stare caught right in the middle
Have you wondered for a while
I have a feeling deep down
You're caught in the middle?

Might never been so wrong
