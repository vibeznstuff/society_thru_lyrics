You put the drops on the paper
You said it would bring us closer to nature
And it did

So we got lost in the desert
Even though it was your best friend's bedroom
By ourselves

We did it all, babe
Yeah, we did it all and then some
I wish everything in life could be this random

We were the last ones
Yeah, we were the last ones standing
Never knew this party could be so demanding

Turn this song up loud
When the party dies down
And everyone's passed out

Play this song right now
If you're feeling yourself
And wanna let it all out

A sunset in a private jet
While having sex could be the best
End to a night

Success leads to happiness
At least that's what you said
But all it did was take your time

'Cause we had it all, babe
Yeah, we had it all and then some
Wish I could freeze time and keep this moment

The last ones
Yeah, we were the last ones standing
Never knew that life would end up being so random

Turn this on up loud
When the party dies down
And everyone's passed out

Play this song right now
If you're feeling yourself
And wanna let it all out
