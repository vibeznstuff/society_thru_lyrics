Ooh, ooh

Some people put in all their time
Some people suffer once in thrie life
Some people would surrender their last dime
For a loving affair
Don't matter if your close in time
Don't matter if your sharp and wide eyed
Don't matter if the stars are shining bright
Cos it'll be alright

So if you feel like your going no where
(going nowhere)
I'm going to show you things that we could share



Whenever your thinking that loves unkind
Follow me
We'll go walking in paradise
(Follow me, Follow me)
Whenever your looking for peace of mind, baby
We can make it happen just close your eyes and i'll be there

It could of been the way you smiled
It could have been the things you said last night
It could have been the secrets in your eyes
That put love in the air

So any time your all alone (all alone)
And anytime you feel you can't go on
Anytime you need a helping hand
I got something for you



(I will be there) If your hurting inside
(I will be there) If your're reading my mind
(There you will find) I'm the reason you have to believe
Just understand (understand) you've got to hold out your hand
