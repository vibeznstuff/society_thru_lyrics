You said you'd be there for me
In times of trouble when I need you and I'm down
And likewise you need friendship
It's from my side pure love but I see lately things have been changing

You have goals to achieve but the roads you take abroad and heartbeats
That wants you make another way
You throw stones, can you see that I am human?
I am breathing but you don't give a damn

Can you feel my heart is beating?
Can you see the pain you're causing?
Can you feel my heart is beating?
Can you see the pain you're causing?

Blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood
Blood keeps rushing

And now the world is asleep, how will you ever wake her up
When she is deep in her dreams wishing?
And yet so many die, and still we think
That it is all about us, it's all about you

You sold your soul to the evil and the lust
And the passion and the money and you
Innocent ones die, people hunger for decades
Suffer under civilized armed robbers, slaveholders

Can you feel my heart is beating?
Can you see the pain you're causing?
Can you feel my heart is beating?
Can you see the pain you're causing?

Blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood
Blood keeps rushing

Evaded, eliminated, erased, interrogated
Our tradition, our love for our fellow countrymen
Our property, our resources, our pride

Can you feel? Can you feel my heart beating?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You don't, don't, don't

Can you feel my heart is beating?
Can you see the pain you're causing?
Can you feel my heart is beating?
Can you see the pain you're causing?
