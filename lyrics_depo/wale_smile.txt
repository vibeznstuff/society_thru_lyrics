I got my family
And I got my squad
And as long as they got me
Then I'll be just fine
So I give God the glory
Cause I have my child
And America don't want me
That's when I realized
That we all need, yeah
A reason to smile
I said we all need, yeah
A reason to smile
Said about to be O.D.'d, yeah
But we gon' survive
That's why we all need
A reason to smile

And a possible bigot slash misogynist is 'bout to run the whole damn thing
(Bout to run the whole damn thing)
And the ballot my sister filled in
In another city didn't do a God-damn thing

Shit I'm a go crazy yeah
I'm a go crazy yeah
I'm a go crazy yeah
But I gotta do my God-damn thing

The Alt Rights hate us
Some black baby mommas hate us
We only learn half of the drama, other side crazy
On behalf of Charlamagne I'm sure he ain't trading sides
Maybe I should meet Tomi Lahren, I'll Lauryn Hill her
Train her; she miseducated anyway
Prolly hate the color of my face
I'm just a young black rapping ass African
Ain't never wanted to have it and now he has it his own way
I'm smoking purple, the law enforcement be murking brothers
The moon lit and I'm Cottonmouth like Mahershala
Its like you got a curse if your currency low
The world is a dirty fucking experiment
They don't care if its hurting us
Black lives matter, 'cause black lives target practice
Can't even imagine what would happen with no phone cameras
Black lives matter, black love the dopest ever
Just wanna remind you, I think it's time that we show it better

I got my family
And I got my squad
And as long as they got me
Then I'll be just fine
So I give God the glory
Cause I have my child
And America don't want me
That's what I realized
That we all need, yeah
A reason to smile
I said we all need, yeah
A reason to smile
Said about to be O.D.'d, yeah
But we gon' survive
That's why we all need
A reason to smile

Giving knowledge and uplifting our brothers and daughters
Is how this whole thing change
(Is how this whole thing change)
But the power that's in the pussy or the dollar
Is enough to make us all insane

Shit I'm a go crazy yeah
I'm a go crazy yeah
I'm a go crazy yeah
But I gotta do my God-damn thing


And I've been living like I got one
A couple hundred on me, still in the gold shotgun
You do the most, stop son
Our people not exempt
They in the land of the free
You in the land of free to an extent
Fuck that, I'm a ruffle some feathers
Mess with the temperature, shuffle the weather
Fuck whoever 
Beef is whatever
Kill me, you die and I live forever
When you live without fear
It don't get much better
Naw, hmm
Look at how far that we've come
Look at the world we inspired
And look at the stars that we brung
They think that when that literal big wig starts that we done
They think because Hillary lost the cards will be Trumped
You out you mind nigga


I got my family
And I got my squad
And as long as they got me
Then I'll be just fine
So I give God the glory
Cause I have my child
And America don't want me
That's what I realized
That we all need, yeah
A reason to smile
I said we all need, yeah
A reason to smile
Said about to be O.D.'d, yeah
But we gon' survive
That's why we all need
A reason to smile
