Remember I'm the one who didn't have a lot to say
I was trying to find the courage, but I let you walk away
And I can't forget your face, y'know it haunts me all the time
And it seems to me you're living in a dream 


Wish we could run away, and we could be alone together
Far away, and leave the world behind
Runaway, what I want to say is
You're a part of me, let me be a part of you 

Want to tell you what I'm thinking, but the words get in the way
When I'm sitting here alone I find the things I meant to say
If I wrote them in a letter, would you read between the lines
Would you understand how much I really care 



(I) I love you
(Need) I need you
(You) Don't want to live without you 

If I'm backward counting forward, would you help me realize
All the answers to the questions I've been asking with my eyes
I could hand you all the cliches, but you've heard them all before
And I want to say I love you in my own way 



And could we run away...
