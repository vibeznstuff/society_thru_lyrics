Out of control
Out of control
Out of control

Sometimes I feel that I'm missunderstood
The rivers run and deep right through my thought
Your naked body lying on the ground
You always get me up when I'm down

And it always seems we're runnin' out of time,
We're out of control
Out of Control
Out of control

Maybe I'm just scared of losin' you
Or maybe it's the things you make me do
It seems to me we both should hang around
And raise the population of this town

And it always seems we're runnin' out of time,
We're out of control
Out of Control
We're out of control
Out of Control

But It doesn't mean we're too far down the line
We're out of control
Out of Control

The record player keeps on turning round
It could be stuck or maybe it's a sound
All the time I should be there with you
But maybe I'm just searchin' for the truth
Or maybe I'm just searchin' for the truth

And it always seems we're running out of time.
We're Out Of Control
Out Of control
We're Out Of Control
Out Of control

But It doesn't mean we're too far down the line
We're Out Of Control
Out Of control
We're Out Of Control
Out Of control

Could be that I'm just losing my touch
Or maybe you think my moustache is too much
Satellite is out of control
But you and I are brothers of the soul
And you and I will come in from the cold

Out of control, Out of control
We're out of control
Out of control
