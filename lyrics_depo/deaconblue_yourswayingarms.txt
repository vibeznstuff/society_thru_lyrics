Send me back all the thing she ever wrote
Tell me secrets of her days when she was young
Show me nights when she laughed
So innocent
I'll be happy
Waiting till they come

Love the people that she smiled upon
Walk with me in streets
Where she once stood
Say if it could be that we once passed like strangers
Long before the love we ever new

'Cause I've been longing
For a new world waiting
I've been hoping
To be sent
I've been picking up
All the love we squandered
Until you
Hold me in your swaying arms again

One day I can see us walking
Arm and arm in sheltered Kelvin way
Talking and tripping and teasing
And heading for the best part of the day

When your head
Falls softly on my pillow
No fear will make you cry or turn you grey
And we will wake
So early in the morning
Knowing you'll never
Never
Never go away
