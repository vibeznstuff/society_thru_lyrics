I love you from the bottom of my pencil case 
I love you in the songs I write and sing 
Love you because you put me in my rightful place 
And I love the PRS cheques that you bring 

Cheap, never cheap 
I'll sing you songs till you're asleep 
When you've gone upstairs I'll creep 
And write it all down
Down, down, down...

Oh Shirley, oh Deborah, oh Julie, oh Jane 
I wrote so many songs about you 
I forget your name (I forget your name) 
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue,
Deborah, Annabel, too (I forget your name)
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue,
Deborah, Annabel, too (I forget your name)

I love you from the bottom of my pencil case 
I love the way you never ask me why 
I love to write about each wrinkle on your face 
And I love you till my fountain pen runs dry 

Deep so deep, 
The number one I hope to reap 
Depends upon the tears you weep,
So cry, lovey cry 
Cry, cry, cry 

Oh Cathy, oh Alison, oh Phillipa, oh Sue 
You made me so much money, 
I wrote this song for you (I wrote this song for you)
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, 
Deborah, Annabel, too (I wrote this song for you)
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, 
Deborah, Annabel, too (I wrote this song for you)

Oh Cathy, oh Alison, oh Phillipa, oh Sue 
You made me so much money, 
I wrote this song for you (I wrote this song for you)
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, 
Deborah, Annabel, too (I wrote this song for you)
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, 
Deborah, Annabel, too (I wrote this song for you)

For you, for you... I wrote this song for you

So let me talk about Mary, a sad story,
I turned her grief into glory
So let me talk about Mary, a sad story,
I turned her grief into glory
Late at night, by the typewriter light
She ripped his ribbon to shreds
Late at night, by the typewriter light
She ripped his ribbon to shreds

So let me talk about Mary, a sad story,
I turned her grief into glory
So let me talk about Mary, a sad story,
I turned her grief into glory
Late at night, by the typewriter light
She ripped his ribbon to shreds
Late at night, by the typewriter light
She ripped his ribbon to shreds

So let me talk about Mary, a sad, sad, sad story,
I turned her grief into glory
So let me talk about Mary, a sad story,
I turned her grief into glory
Late at night, by the typewriter light
She ripped his ribbon to shreds
Late at night, by the typewriter light
She ripped his ribbon to shreds

I wrote this song for you
