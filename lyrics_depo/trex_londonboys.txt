Oh yea we're the London boys
Oh yea we're the London boys
Oh yea we're the London boys
Oh yea we're the London boys
Do you remember
Going to Petticoat Lane
With all the conceptions
Moving in your brain
Oh yea we're the London boys
Oh yea we're the London boys
Don't you remember that we're just the London boys
Oh yea we're the London boys
Mighty mean mod king
Dressed like fame
London to Brighton
And then back again
Changing life's patterns
To get to the top
And when you get up there
You don't know if you're there or what
