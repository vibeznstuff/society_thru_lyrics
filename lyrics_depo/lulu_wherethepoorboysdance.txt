Believe life's a journey
Which road will you travel on
One road leads to heaven
One road only leads you wrong

How come it don't make no sense
Where did my contentment go
Is this a loss of innocence
Heaven only knows

Take me where the poor boys dance
Back to where it all began
I need to find out who I am

Something that'll live back there
Out there in the cool night air
I just need to know that someone cares
(Oh, do you still care for me)

Sometimes, in the morning
I can still remember dreams
When I really listen
Understand just what they mean

I gotta cut the ties that bind
Let the riches go
How can I ignore the signs
Calling me back home

Take me where the poor boys dance
Back to where it all began
I need to find out who I am
Something that'll live back there
Out there in the cool night air
I just need to know that someone cares

Sometimes, I'm lost in a separate world
But the ghosts of the past
Just won't let me go

So take me where the poor boys dance
Take me where the poor boys dance

(Oh, I'm going home) I'm finally coming home
(Where the poor boys dance) don't let go
I'm finally coming home (where the poor boys dance)

(Ohh, I'm going home)
Where the poor boys dance
