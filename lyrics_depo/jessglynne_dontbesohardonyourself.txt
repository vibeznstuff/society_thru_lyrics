I came here with a broken heart that no one else could see
I drew a smile on my face to paper over me
But wounds heal and tears dry and cracks they don't show
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

Let's go back to simplicity
I feel like I've been missing me
Was not who I'm supposed to be
I felt this darkness over me
We all get there eventually
I never knew where I belonged
But I was right and you were wrong
Been telling myself all along

Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

I'm standin' on top of the world, right where I wanna be
So how can this dark cloud be raining over me
But hearts break and hell's a place that everyone knows
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

Let's go back to simplicity
I feel like I've been missing me
Was not who I'm supposed to be
I felt this darkness over me
We all get there eventually
I never knew where I belonged
But I was right and you were wrong
Been telling myself all along

Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

Oh, oh, oh, I
I learned to wave goodbye
How not to see my life
Through someone else's eyes
It's not an easy road
But no I'm not alone
So I, I won't be so hard on myself no more

Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
