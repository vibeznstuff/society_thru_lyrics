As long as you got me you won't need nobody
You want it, I got it. Go get it, I'll buy it
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet



Shawty you the hottest. Love the way you drop it.
Brain so good could've sworn you went to college.

And everybody know it ain't tricking if you got it
You ain't never ever gotta go in your wallet.
Long as I got rubber band banks in my pocket.
5 6 rides with rims and a body kit.
You ain't gotta downgrade you can get what I get
My chick can have what she want.
And go in any store for any bag she wants.
I know you ain't never had a man like that.
To buy you anything your heart desire like that.

I want your body, I need your body.
Long as you got me, you won't need nobody.
You want it, I got it. Go get it, I'll buy it.
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet.

Let me put this big boy in your life. that's right.

I want your body, I need your body.
Long as you got me, you won't need nobody.
You want it, I got it. Go get it, I'll buy it.
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet.
