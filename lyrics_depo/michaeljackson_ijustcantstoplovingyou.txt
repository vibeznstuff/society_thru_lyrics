I Just Want To Lay Next To You
For Awhile
You Look So Beautiful Tonight
Your Eyes Are So Lovely
Your Mouth Is So Sweet
A Lot Of People
Misunderstand Me
That's Because They Don't
Know Me At All
I Just Want To Touch You
And Hold You
I Need You
God I Need You
I Love You So Much


Each Time The Wind Blows
I Hear Your Voice So
I Call Your Name . . .
Whispers At Morning
Our Love Is Dawning
Heaven's Glad You Came . . .

You Know How I Feel
This Thing Can't Go Wrong
I'm So Proud To Say
I Love You
Your Love's Got Me High
I Long To Get By
This Time Is Forever
Love Is The Answer


I Hear Your Voice Now
You Are My Choice Now
The Love You Bring
Heaven's In My Heart
At Your Call
I Hear Harps,
And Angels Sing

You Know How I Feel
This Thing Can't Go Wrong
I Can't Live My Life
Without You


I Just Can't Hold On


I Feel We Belong


My Life Ain't Worth Living
If I Can't Be With You


I Just Can't Stop Loving You
I Just Can't Stop Loving You
And If I Stop . . .
Then Tell Me Just What
Will I Do


'Cause I Just Can't Stop
Loving You


At Night When The
Stars Shine
I Pray In You I'll Find
A Love So True . . .


When Morning Awakes Me
Will You Come And Take Me
I'll Wait For You


You Know How I Feel
I Won't Stop Until
I Hear Your Voice Saying
"I Do"


"I Do"
This Thing Can't Go Wrong


This Feeling's So Strong


Well, My Life Ain't
Worth Living


If I Can't Be With You
I Just Can't Stop Loving You
I Just Can't Stop Loving You
And If I Stop . . .
Then Tell Me, Just What
Will I Do


I Just Can't Stop Loving You


We Can Change All The World
Tomorrow


We Can Sing Songs Of
Yesterday


I Can Say, Hey . . .Farewell
To Sorrow


This Is My Life And I,


Want To See You For Always
I Just Can't Stop Loving You


No, Baby


Oh!


I Just Can't Stop Loving You


If I Can't Stop!


And If I Stop . . .


No


Oh! Oh! Oh . . .Oh . . .


What Will I Do? Uh . . .Ooh . . .
(Then Tell Me, Just What
Will I Do)


I Just Can't Stop Loving You


Hee! Hee! Hee! Know I Do
Girl!


I Just Can't Stop Loving You


You Know I Do
And If I Stop . . .


Then Tell Me, Just What
Will I Do 


I Just Can't Stop Loving You
