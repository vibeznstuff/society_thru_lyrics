Everybody was talkin' to me like I was a child
In their words I could hear them saying it's just a matter of time
Any way it's a long, long race been run
Anyway it's a sad, sad song been sung

Dear John goodbye she said, sometimes it's hard she said
Dear John I've broken away

Vanity is a hard old lady, you can't read her mind
I'm a fool but I don't fool easy while you're foolin' around
Anyway I can hold my own tonight
I admit I was wrong and you were right

Dear John goodbye she said, sometimes it's hard she said
Dear John I've broken away
