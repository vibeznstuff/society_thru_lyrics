Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well, I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool

My mu√±equita,
My Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove, yeah.


And if you said, "This life ain't good enough."
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth


And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well, that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth, yeah.
Gimme your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it

Well, I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it'd be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out

Out from the barrio,
You hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you 'round and 'round







Or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Oh, let's don't forget about it
(Gimme your heart, make it real)
Let's don't forget about it (hey)
Let's don't forget about it (no oh no oh)
Let's don't forget about it (no no no oh)
Let's don't forget about it (hey no no oh)
Let's don't forget about it (hey hey hey)
