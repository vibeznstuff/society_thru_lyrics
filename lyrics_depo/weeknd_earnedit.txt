You make it look like it's magic, oh, yeah
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused
Hey, hey
I'm so used to being used

So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah

'Cause, girl, you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause, girl, you earned it,
Shit
Girl, you earned it,
Yeah

You know our love would be tragic, oh, yeah
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind
We live with no lies
Hey, hey
You're my favorite kind of night

So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah

'Cause, girl, you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause, girl, you earned it
Shit
Girl, you earned it,
Yeah

On that lonely night
We said it wouldn't be love
But we felt the rush
It made us believe it was only us, only us
Convinced we were broken inside, shit, inside, shit

'Cause, girl, you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause, girl, you earned it
Shit
Girl, you earned it
Yeah
