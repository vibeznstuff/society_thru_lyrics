To the dancefloor, tonight
Let love start

Calling all party people in the place to be
We gonna celebrate tonight
And rock out with the family
Here we go

Calling all hearts (to the dancefloor)
Tonight, let love start
On the dancefloor, tonight
Let's go

I got a feeling everybody need a reason to shout
Leave all your problems and your drama at the door and get down
This is where we all unite
If we get it right, we gonna light up the sky
At this place, in this time
We gotta let go, 'cause it's alright

Calling all hearts (to the dancefloor)
Tonight, let love start
On the dancefloor, tonight

Go a little harder with your partner
Heat it up in this place
It's ok to make up
If you take up, put a smile on your face
This is where we all unite
We gonna groove
We gonna move into the night
Have this amazing time, yeah
You gotta let go cause it's alright

Calling all hearts (to the dancefloor)
Tonight, let love start
On the dancefloor, tonight

If the feeling's tonight
Then I'm calling all hearts, you can call in all hearts, yeah
A celebration of love
Then I'm calling all hearts, you can call in all hearts, yeah

One, two, three, go
Shake it, shake it down tonight
That's right
Shake it down, shake it down, that's right
Shake it, shake it down tonight
That's right
Shake it down, shake it down, that's right

Oh, dance a little bit more (just dance a little bit more)
Come all night (come together, hey)
Move a little bit more
Come all night, oh yeah

Calling all hearts
To the dance floor
You gotta let it stop
(You gotta let it stop, you gotta let it sto!)
Back to the dance floor tonight
To the dance floor
Then I'm calling all hearts
(I'm calling everybody, I'm calling everyone
I'm calling everybody, get you)
Tonight is the night, tonight is the night
I'm calling all hearts, I'm calling all hearts
I'm calling all hearts, I'm calling all hearts

I rock tonight
Calling all hearts
Calling all hearts, hearts, hearts
