when i see her eyes
look into my eyes
then i realize that
she could see inside my head
so i close my eyes
thinking that i could hide
disassociate so i don't have to lose my head
this situation leads to agitation
will she cut me off?
will this be amputation?

i don't know if i care
i'm the jerk
life's not fair

fighting all the time 
this is out of line
she loves me not
do you realize I won't compromise
she loves me not

over the past five years
i have shed my tears
i have drank my beers and watched my fears fly away
until this day
she still swings my way
but it's sad to say sometimes
she says she loves me not
i hesitate
to tell her i hate
this relationship 
i want out today 
this is over 

line for line 
rhyme for rhyme
sometimes we be fightin' all the goddamn time -it's making me sick
relationship is getting ill
piss drunk stupid 
mad 
on the real 
could you feel what I feel
what's the deal girl
we're tearing up each other's world
we should be in harmony 
boy and girl
that is the promise we made
back in the day
we told each other things wouldn't be this way
i think we should work this out
it's all right baby we can scream and shout

life's not fair

i'm the jerk

she loves me not
