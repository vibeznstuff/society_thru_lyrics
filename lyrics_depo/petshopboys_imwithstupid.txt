Oh-oh, I'm with Stupid
Oh-oh, I'm with Stupid

See you on the TV
Call you every day
Fly across the ocean
Just to let you get your way
No one understands me
Where I'm coming from
Why would I be with someone
Who's obviously so dumb?
Love comes 
Love grows
Every time you rise to meet me
Take my hand to greet me
Love comes 
Love grows
And power can give a man
Much more than anybody knows

Oh-oh, I'm with Stupid
Oh-oh, I'm with Stupid
Oh-oh, I'm with Stupid
Oh-oh, I'm with Stupid

Before we ever met
I thought like everybody did
You were just a moron
A billion-dollar kid
You flew up all the way
Like a hawk chasing a dove
I never thought that I would be
A sacrifice in love
It comes
It grows
And now we're tied together
Everybody knows

Oh-oh, I'm with Stupid
Oh-oh, I'm with Stupid
Oh-oh, I'm with Stupid
Oh-oh, I'm with Stupid

Is stupid really stupid
Or a different kind of smart?
Do we really have a relationship 
So special in your heart?

Oh-oh, I'm with Stupid
Oh-oh, I'm with Stupid

I have to ask myself
Like any lover might:
Have you made a fool of me?
Are you not Mr. Right?
You grin
I pose
It's not about sincerity
Everybody knows

Oh-oh, I'm with Stupid
Oh-oh, I'm with Stupid
Oh-oh, I'm with Stupid
Oh-oh, I'm with Stupid

Is stupid really stupid
Or a different kind of smart?
That's how you stole my heart
I'm with Stupid
