Disrupt and keep dividing
The government is lying
I'm not gonna be a Pharisee of this society
Turn off your TV station
That's not real information
Trying to define the human mind
It's like puppetry
And they've got you by your strings
Playing God for money
A sorry sad charade
You can see right through it

Don't wait for anyone
To say it for you
Say it for yourself
What if God was the beggar in disguise
Would it make any difference
Would you open your eyes?

Suspend your disbelief
Are you paying close attention
If you blink then you might miss
Their tricks and their deception
Destruct and disobey their lies they say
Cause all the world's a stage
And if you choose to read the news
Then you must question everything
And they've got you on your knees
They've got your milk and honey
Then we put them on the parade
And celebrate what's coming

Don't wait for anyone
To say it for you
Say it for yourself
What if God was the beggar in disguise
Would it make any difference
Would you open your eyes?

No kings
No queens
No justice
No peace
Dig deep, believe
The truth will set you free
No kings
No queens
No justice
No peace
Dig deep and see
The government is lying

Don't wait for anyone
To say it for you
Say it for yourself
What if God was the beggar in disguise
Would it make any difference
Would you open your eyes?

No kings
No queens
No justice
No peace
Dig deep, believe
The truth will set you free
No kings
No queens
No justice
No peace
Would it make any difference
Would you open your eyes?
