Cos I've been sitting back, no chance of falling, hoping that nothing ever blows (no, no)
Boy, did you ever think that loving would be nothing more than walking me home? (no, no)
Cos I've been sitting back, no chance of falling, hoping that nothing ever blows (yeah, yeah)
Boy, did you ever think that loving would be nothing more than walking me home? (no, no)


Did you tell him? No, no, no
Give him kisses? No, no, no
Whisper honey? No, no, no
You're god delicious? Hell no!

Were you dancing? No, no, no
Sweet as toffee? No, no, no
Get his number? No, no, no
Get him out of coffee? Hell yeah!



I can't deny the way my 
d-d-dirty mind is saying
"Lover, come and get me!" (get me)

But for a while I bought that d-d-dirty style, 
when I discovered that it's sexy, sexy!


But you're knock knock knoking again, boy
Whoa oh, couldn't be good enough,
Gonna keep you waiting
Knock knock knocking again, boy
Whoa oh, get your sugar
Rush and do a little chasing




From top to bottom,
I'm the woman sunshine
He knows that reason will believe in my side


I give you nothing 'til you show me
Something, something, something
Cos damn good loving's what I'm really
Wanting, wanting, wanting


I can't deny the way my 
d-d-dirty mind is saying
"Lover, come and get me!" (get me)

But for a while I bought that d-d-dirty style, 
when I discovered that it's sexy, sexy!
