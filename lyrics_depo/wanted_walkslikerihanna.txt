Have you seen that girl?
Have you seen her?
She’s the freakiest thing, you gotta meet her
You do whatever it takes to get her by your side

It’s not the way she smiles with a little laugh
It’s not the way she looks in a photograph
But all the boys – they crowd around

She can’t sing, she can’t dance
But who cares – she walks like Rihanna!
She can’t sing, she can’t dance
But who cares – she walks like Rihanna!

Have you seen that girl?
Have you seen her?
With the way she moves you wanna kiss her
She’ll be the girl of your dreams if you can close your eyes

You can feel that beat when she’s in the room
You can feel your heart going boom boom
And all the boys – they crowd around

She can’t sing, she can’t dance
But who cares – she walks like Rihanna!
She can’t sing, she can’t dance
But who cares – she walks like Rihanna!

She walks like Rihanna!
She walks like Rihanna!

Our hearts go boom boom boom boom boom 
(she walks like Rihanna!)

She can’t sing, she can’t dance
But who cares – she walks like Rihanna!

She can’t sing, she can’t dance
But who cares – she walks like Rihanna!
She can’t sing, she can’t dance
But who cares – she walks like Rihanna!

She walks like Rihanna!
She walks like Rihanna!

Our hearts go boom boom boom boom boom 
(she walks like Rihanna!)
