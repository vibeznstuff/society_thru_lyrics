You say I ain't the man you fell in love with
Well, you know I can't say that ain't true
You used to love everything about me
Now you hate everything that I do

Yeah, we channeled all our energies and passion
That we used to use tryin' to make up
Now they're all empty words and endless fightin'
That we use as an excuse to not make love

Let's just let go, tryin' to hold on
And we both know we're already gone
Everyone knows once love goes bad
You can want it but you're never ever gonna get it back
Why should we fight and waste one more night?
Let's just let go

Girl, you know that it ain't that I don't love you
And deep down, I know you love me too
It's just we can't bridge this gap that's come between us
What's the use in tryin', we both know the truth

Let's just let go, tryin' to hold on
And we both know we're already gone
Everyone knows once love goes bad
You can want it but you're never ever gonna get it back
So why should we fight and waste one more night?

We could walk away right now and never stop
To look back
And all that we had

We could let go of our foolish pride
Forgive one another, give us one more try
'Cause everyone knows once love goes bad
You can want it but you're never ever gonna get it back
Why should we fight and waste one more night?
Let's just let go
