Yes, I know you
Sometime she talks to him
Sometimes when she's only dreaming
Then when she wakes up
Somehow she still believes him

Yes, I know you
Tho we've been out of touch
Yes, I know you
To be continued, it's too much baby

I can't wait... I can't wait
Well, I've got to know when I can see you again, now baby
I can't wait... I can't wait
Am I wasting my time while you make up your mind
Well, I can't wait... I can't wait
Yes, I know you
Tho we've been out of touch
I can't wait... I can't wait
What can I do when I'm crazy for you

She wonders how many more hours
Her heart will feel broken
In secret she says she needs to see him
But no words are spoken

She dances around in a circle
Well she's got that feeling now
Blame it on something at first sight
Put the blame on me if you want to
To be continued

I can't wait... I can't wait
Am I wasting my time while you make up your mind
Well, I can't wait... I can't wait
I got to know when I can see you again
Well, I can't wait... I can't wait
I can't wait... I can't wait
I can't wait... I can't wait
How will we feel 20 years from now
