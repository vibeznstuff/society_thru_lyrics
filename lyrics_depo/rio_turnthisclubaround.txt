Turn this club around
Ayo ayo
Ayo ayo

If you want more
Just check my swagger out there on the dance floor
Yeah all the ladies gonna knock on my door
Gonna be the time of your life
We gonna do it tonight
Do it tonight

Something's heatin' up, heatin' up
Go check my floor
Hey, meet me up, meet me up
On the V.I.P. floor
DJ speed it up, speed it up
Play it loud
We gonna turn this club around

We gonna make our bitches working on the floor
Wanna see my sexy ladies screaming "gimme more"
Yeah, we can turn this club around,
Gonna burn it, burn it down, singing:
Ayo ayo, ayo ayo!

Come on and rock that booty, make me lose my mind
My rock is slowly with champagne every Saturday night
Yeah, we can turn this club around,
Gonna burn it, burn it down, singing:
Ayo ayo, ayo ayo!

(Let's go)

I got no time for intellectual romance
I'm going crazy watching you the way you dance
Gonna be time of your life
We gonna do it tonight
Do it tonight

Something's heatin' up, heatin' up

Hey, meet me up, meet me up
On the V.I.P. floor
