You are the sun
You are the only one
My heart is blue
My heart is blue for you
Be my, be my, be my little rock and roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock and roll queen

You are the sun
You are the only one
You are so cool
You are so rock and roll

Be my, be my, be my little rock and roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock and roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock and roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock and roll queen

You are the sun
You are the only one
You are so cool
It's all so rock and roll
