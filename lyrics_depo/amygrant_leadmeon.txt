Shoulder to the wheel
For someone else's selfish gain
Here there is no choosing
Working the clay
Wearing their anger like a ball and chain
Fire in the field
Underneath the blazing sun
But soon the sun was faded
And freedom was a song
I heard them singing when the day was done
Singing to the holy one


Lead me on
Lead me on
To a place where the river runs
Into your keeping, oh
Lead me on
Lead me on
The awaited deliverance
Comforts the seeking...lead on

Waiting for the train
Labelled with a golden star
Heavy hearted boarding
Whispers in the dark
"Where are they going-is it very far?"
Bitter cold terrain
Echoes of a slamming door
In chambers made for sleeping
Forever
Voices like thunder in a mighty roar
Cry to the lord



Man hurts man
Time and time, time again
And we drown in the wake of our power
Somebody tell me why
