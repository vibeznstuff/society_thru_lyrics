Come on baby, doo doo doo doo doo
Ooh, yeah, come on

Now baby he keeps on saying that
He tells you you’re the only one
But everybody knows he’s out there having fun
Behind your back and that’s a fact and it ain’t right
‘Cos he’s a fly guy acting alike a gentleman
But back in the day I can still remember when
He’d just turn around, wouldn’t look twice at you
And I’m just being straight with you
‘Cos he takes you for a fool
So you should be on your guard
When he thinks you don’t have a clue
And I think if the truth be known
That you’ll end up all alone when
He gets everything he wants
So girl open up your eyes and see with me

What you see is what you get
Ain’t no hidden agenda
So girlfriend when he’s playing around you’d do well to remember


Now lady when he tells you
That he loves you and won’t give you up
Take your car and it’s your money that be filling it up
Look at what he’s got, think he’s hit the jackpot and it ain’t right
‘Cos your connections keep him sweet and that’s so typical
He’s only in it for himself and that’s so cynical
He’d be out of sight girl if you lost it all
So I feel so bad inside when he’s cruising in your ride
‘Cos I know baby late at night
There’s some other girl by his side
And I wanna let you know that he really ought to go 
And you should belive in me
‘Cos I care baby can’t you see with me



Now baby girl when he does you wrong
I’ll make sure you’re alright, yeah
I just wanna be your friend
‘Cos there’s no reason to pretend
And that’s the difference with me oh girl
