We'll be passing by, and they'll be wasting time
Just waiting for news,
And while they're chasing darts, we'll be dancing in their dust
Cause we're coming through
Whenever you need me, I'm behind
And I'll promise to take you up to the highs

When you feel you've had enough, and you've wasted all your love
I'll be here for you, here for you
When the dog has left his bone, and you've run away from home
I'll be here for you, here for you

I'm here for you, I'm here for you, you, you
I'm here for you, yeah, I'm here for you, you, you

And while they're on the ground, we'll be looking down
'Cause we've found the truth
And the fire in our hearts, we'll be blowing up the stars
Now we're coming through, yeah
Whenever you feeling down inside
I'll promise to take you up to the highs

Ah yeah, I'm here for you
And when you feel you've had enough and you've wasted all your love
I'll be here for you

I'm here for you, I'm here for you, you, you
I'm here for you, yeah, I'm here for you, you, you
