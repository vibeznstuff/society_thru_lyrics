Stop me if you've heard it all before, girl
Stop me, there'll be no more to say

I'd give you the world if the world was mine to give, mmm-mmm
I would hold you dear for as long as I live
Oh, darling you and I, oh, we could light up the world
Yeah, an ordinary guy and a wonderful girl, yeaheah

Richer we can be, richer than a millionaire, mmm
We have everything money just couldn't buy
Yeah! Fancy diamond rings and a place in society
Oho, that don't mean a thing, so, my love, we'll get by
(We'll get by, we'll get by, we'll get by)

But stop me if you've heard it all before, girl
Stop me, all you've gotta do is say
If your love is still unsure, love
Then stop me, there'll be no more to say

There's no guarantee I will find a pot of gold, mmm-mmm
Who can ever tell where that rainbow will end, oho
Just put your trust in me and together all our love, yeah
Because on my word you can always depend ('Till the end, 'till the end)

But stop me if you've heard it all before, girl
Stop me, all you've gotta do is say
If your love is still unsure, love
Then stop me, there'll be no more to say

Oho, stop me if you've heard it all before, girl
Stop me, all you've gotta do is say
If your love is still unsure, love
Then stop me, there'll be no more to say

(Stop me, you can stop me) Oh (Stop me), yeaheah
There'll be no more to say
(Stop me, you can stop me)
There'll be no more to say
