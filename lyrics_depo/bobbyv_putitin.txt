I don't usually say this
Yea do just play it
Let me see wussup
Well now something got me loose, fill it up
We can go all night long
I love bumping, not talking bout the iPhone
Look right girl I know you down
Turn it from around

Swing em up, baby you'll be saying don't stop
And when we bout to finish you tell me get on top
Be real, we are
Girl I gotta get 5 stars, no playin
Just talkin to you got me sayin

I'm a put it in, p-p-put it in
I'm a put it in, I ain't jokin girl why you playin?
I'm a put it in, p-p-put it in
I'm a put it in, I ain't jokin girl why you playin?

See I don't usually say this
Hold your hands, we gon get x rated
See this song tonight's for a special guy
This right here song the next you write
I'm a change it up
Instead of talking I'm gon show it
Put your hands on my thighs
We go all night in slow motion
We speed it up
Just a part like ladies club
Make moves, come back to my place
And let's do something on that straight laze
We go all night all night all night
I'm just saying
Uu stop tripping, I rewind, you're playin

I tell you put it in, p-p-put it in
I tell you put it in, I ain't jokin boy why you playin?
I tell you put it in, p-p-put it in
I tell you put it in, I ain't jokin boy why you playin?

I wanna make love to you, wanna make love to you, wanna make love to you
Boy I wanna make love to you, wanna make love to you, wanna make love to you
Let's go

Cause when I'm up in it you'll be saying don't stop
I'm gon have you begging for more
Cause girl I wanna give it to you
Boy I wanna give it to you
I'm a freak that body all night

I'm a put it in, p-p-put it in
I'm a put it in, I ain't jokin girl why you playin?
I tell you put it in, p-p-put it in
I tell you put it in, I ain't jokin boy why you playin?
I tell you put it in, p-p-put it in
I tell you put it in, I ain't jokin boy why you playin?
