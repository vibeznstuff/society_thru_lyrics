Philosophy gives itself freely to all of our minds
You have yours and I have mine
I'll do you a favour completely free of charge
And tell you you're wrong and I'm right

If you'd think it over maybe you'd come round to seeing reason
Think it over it's something that's out of your hands

Well I'm going right out of my head
It's just a matter of time
Is there something that I could have said
That would make you change your mind
Or is it just the way your mind works

I wish I could conjure up something more pointed to say
But I'm just trying to tell you as a friend
Think it over think it over think it over again
You don't have to borrow in order to lend

If you'd think it over maybe you'd come round to seeing reason
Think it over it's something that's out of your hands

I'm going right out of my head
It's just a matter of time
Is there something that I could have said
That would make you change your mind
Or is it just the way your mind works
