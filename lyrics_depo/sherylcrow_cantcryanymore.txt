Took your car
Drove to Texas
Sorry, honey
But I suspected we were through
And I can't cry anymore
Since I left
Been feelin' better, cause that's
What you get when you
Stay together too long
And I can't cry anymore


Wouldn't it be good if
we could hop a flight to anywhere
So long to this life
So much for pretending
Bad luck's never-ending
And now I know that

Money comes in
But the fact is
There's not enough to
Pay my taxes
And I can't cry anymore
Well, got a brother
He's got real problems
Heroin - no
There's just no stopping him tonight
And I won't cry anymore



It's never ending

It could be worse
I could've missed my calling
Sometimes it hurts 
But when you read the writing on the wall
Can't cry anymore



And too much time I've been spending
With my heart in my hands 
Waiting for time to come and mend it

I can't cry anymore
