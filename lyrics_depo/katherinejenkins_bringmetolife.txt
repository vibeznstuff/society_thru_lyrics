How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core where I've become so numb, 
Without a soul
My spirit sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back... home

Wake me up inside
Wake me up inside
Call my name and save me from the dark
Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
Save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life

Wake me up inside
Wake me up inside
Call my name and save me from the dark
Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
Save me from the nothing I've become

(Bring me to life)
(Bring me to life)

Frozen inside without your touch, without your love, darling
Only you are the life, among the dead

Ah... Ah... Life! 

(Wake me up inside)
(Wake me up inside)
Call my name and save me from the dark
Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
Save me from the nothing I've become, bring me to life!
