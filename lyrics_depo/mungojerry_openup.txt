I said, "Open up your ears
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Take your body by surprise, by surprise"

When you're feeling down
Does the rain fall
Heavy all around
Flashing through the storm?

I said, "Open up your ears
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Take your body by surprise, by surprise"

Put your mind at ease
Get out, get in
Yeah, it's all agreed

I said, "Open up your ears
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Take your body by surprise, by surprise"
Oh yeah

Think about today
Not about the past
Open up your head
Yeah, the thoughts come fast

I said, "Open up your ears
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Take your body by surprise, by surprise"

Oh yeah come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I said, "Open up your ears
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Take your body by surprise"

Open up your ears
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Take your body by surprise

Open up your ears
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Take your body by surprise

Open up your ears
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Take your body by surprise

Open up your ears
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Take your body by surprise

Open up your ears
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Take your body by surprise

Open up your ears
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Take your body by surprise

Open up your mind
Take your body by surprise.
