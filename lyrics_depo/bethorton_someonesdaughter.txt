I wanna sit and talk and laugh with you as the day ends
I wanna see your smiling face before the new day begins
You'll never know what it means
To see the sunlight in your hair and dancing everywhere

I wanna shout about it
But I keep quiet about it
I wanna laugh about it
But I don't joke about it
I wanna live without it
But I can't do without it

I'm someone's daughter
Are you somebody's son?
Can I ease your pain till the morning comes
I'm no one's daughter
I belong to the sun
Gonna ease your mind till the morning comes

Keep looking for the reason
High and low to let it go
Keep losing my mind
Looking for the peace that I just don't find
I wanna know how it feels
To be the sunlight in your hair and dancing everywhere

I wanna shout about it
But I keep quiet about it
I wanna laugh about it
But I don't joke about it
I wanna live without it
But I can't do without it

I'm someone's daughter
Are you somebody's son?
Can I ease your pain till the morning comes
I'm no one's daughter
I belong to the sun
Gonna ease your mind 'til the morning comes
