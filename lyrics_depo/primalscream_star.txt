Are you solid, are you solid as a rock
Have you a strong foundation or can your soul be bought
It ain't true that, everybody's got a price
I sing this song for everyone who stands up for their rights

Every brother is a star, every sister is a star
Every brother is a star, every sister is a star

Sister rose, Malcom X and Dr. King
Showed us we got power, showed what changes we could bring
To change society you have gotta change the law
Their bodies may be gone but their spirits still live on

Every brother is a star, every sister is a star
Every brother is a star, every sister is a star

Rebel souls... souls... souls...

For the dreamers, rebel souls and future days
Be brave and strong, keep keeping on, be conscious in the chaos
The queen of England there's no greater anarchist
One man's freedom tighter is another's terrorist

Every brother is a star, every sister is a star
Every brother is a star, every sister is a star
Every brother is a star, every sister is a star
Every brother is a star, every sister is a star
