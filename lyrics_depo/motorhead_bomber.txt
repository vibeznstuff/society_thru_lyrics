Ain't a hope in hell
Nothin' gonna bring us down
The way we fly
Five miles off the ground
Because, we shoot to kill
And you know we always will
It's a Bomber
It's a Bomber
It's a Bomber

Scream a thousand miles
Feel the black death rising moan
Firestorm coming closer
Napalm to the bone
Because, you know we do it right
A mission every night
It's a Bomber
It's a Bomber
It's a Bomber

No nightfighter
Gonna stop us getting through
Sirens make you shiver
You bet my aim is true
Because, we aim to please
Bring you to your knees
It's a Bomber
It's a Bomber
It's a Bomber
