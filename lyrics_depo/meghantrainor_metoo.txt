Who's that sexy thing I see over there?
That's me, standin' in the mirror
What's that icy thing hangin' 'round my neck?
That's gold, show me some respect

I thank God every day
That I woke up feelin' this way
And I can't help lovin' myself
And I don't need nobody else, nuh uh

If I was you, I'd wanna be me, too
I'd wanna be me, too
I'd wanna be me, too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me, too
I'd wanna be me, too
I'd wanna be me, too

I walk in like a dime piece
I go straight to V.I.P.
I never pay for my drinks
My entourage behind me
My life's a movie. Tom Cruise
So bless me, baby, achoo
And even if they tried to
They can't do it like I do

I thank God every day (thank God)
That I woke up feelin' this way
And I can't help lovin' myself
And I don't need nobody else, nuh uh

If I was you, I'd wanna be me, too
I'd wanna be me, too
I'd wanna be me, too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me, too
I'd wanna be me, too
I'd wanna be me, too

Turn the bass up
Turn the bass up
Turn the bass up
Let's go!

I thank God every day (say to thank God)
That I woke up feelin' this way
And I can't help lovin' myself
And I don't need nobody else, nuh uh

If I was you, I'd wanna be me, too
I'd wanna be me, too
I'd wanna be me, too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me, too
I'd wanna be me, too
I'd wanna be me, too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me, too
I'd wanna be me, too
I'd wanna be me, too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me, too
I'd wanna be me, too
I'd wanna be me, too
