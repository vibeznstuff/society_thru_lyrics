Last night my mother said to me
I'm sick of making history
There's got to be another way
But we've got all these bills to pay
And they ain't just gonna go away
Like a factory
about to be shut down
Sold - did you hear it - I'm Sold
Sold - did you hear it - I'm Sold
You're gonna like this one - I do
See if Mr Botha was a man
He'd tip the hat
he'd pass the can
But he dont talk for you and me
I saw him on the BBC
His eyes looked like a factory
With the lights out
About to be shut down
Sold - did you hear it - I'm Sold
Sold - did you hear it - I'm Sold
Last night my mother said to me
I'm sick of making history
There's got to be another way
for you to be
Last night my mother said to me
When you grow up
what will you be
If not the white minority
At least protect me
I'm not a factory about to be shut down
