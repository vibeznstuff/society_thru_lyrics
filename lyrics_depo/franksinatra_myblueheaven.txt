Whippoorwills call, evenin' is nigh
Hurry to my blue heaven
Turn to the right, there's a little white light
Will lead you to my  blue heaven

You'll see a smilin' face, a fireplace, a cozy room
Little nest that nestles where the roses bloom

Molly and me, and the baby makes three
We're happy in my, in my blue heaven



You're gonna see a smilin' face, fireplace, cozy room
And a little nest nestled where the roses bloom

Just molly and me, and the baby is three
We're so happy in my blue heaven
We're happy in my blue heaven
We're happy in my blue heaven!
