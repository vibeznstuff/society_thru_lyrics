It's raining so hard, looks like it's goin' rain all night
And this is the time, I love to be holding you tight
But I guess I'll have to accept, the fact that you're not here
I wish the night would hurry up and end, my dear

It's rainin' so hard, It's really coming down
Sittin' by my window, watching the rain falls to the ground
This is the time, I love to be holding you tight
I guess I'll just go crazy tonight

It's raining so hard, it brings back memories, of the time
When you were here with me
Counting every drop, about the blow in my top
I wish the rain would hurry up and stop

I got the blues so bad, I can hardly catch my breath
The harder it rains, the worse it's gonna get
This is the time, I love to be holding you tight
I gues I'll just go crazy tonight

I got the blues so bad, I can hardly catch my breath
The harder it rains, the worse it's gonna get
This is the time, I love to be holding you tight
I guess I'll just go crazy tonight...
