I didn't hear you leave
I wonder how am I still here
And I don't want to move a thing 
It might change my memory


Oh I am what I am 
I'll do what I want 
But I can't hide
I won't go 
I won't sleep 
I can't breathe 
Until you're resting here with me
I won't leave 
I can't hide 
I cannot be 
Until you're resting here with me

I don't want to call my friends 
They might wake me from this dream
And I can't leave this bed
Risk forgetting all that's been
