Some people wish
Some people dance
Some never take a chance
Some people steal
Just for the thrill
And some drink to get their fill
But I love you

Some people preach
Some people write
And some choose to just stay quiet
Some people teach
Some people roam
Some would rather be alone
But I love you, yeah

Some people hurt
Some people laugh
And some just don't know what they have
But I love you

Baby I love you, yeah
