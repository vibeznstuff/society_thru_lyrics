Ultimatum, badman nuh tek ultimatum,
go wey, yuh haffi stay


If I stay, would you put an end
to all the games you play
Can you promise me
that you will never stray
Has to be a new beginning from today,
only way I will stay
But if I go,
this will be the final curtain of the show
You have lost the best thing
that you ever known
Guess you have to learn
to make it on your own
Let me know stay or go


Before you go let's analyze the situation
I'm a typical Jamaican
why you laying your frustration on me
When we met it was a perfect combination
But you know my reputation
don't know what you were expecting (of) me
Fight back, you can fight
get things a go if yuh nuh like that
Cause I know that
when you (leave) you come right back
Your new found determination
sounds to me like desperation
There's no ground for termination


If I stay, would you put an end
to all the games you play
Can you promise me
that you will never stray
Has to be a new beginning from today,
only way I will stay
But if I go,
this will be the final curtain of the show
You have lost the best thing
that you ever known
Guess you have to learn
to make it on your own
Let me know stay or go


I must admit I have a weakness
for these women
Who a plot like them a villian try the best
to separate you from me
I don't understand
just why the hell your cousin
When you knew that she meant nothing
so what if she was your cousin
You say fight back,
how the hell could I resist
when she's dressed like that
Tell the truth I had to leave
but she came right back
Now you heard the explanation
taken to consideration
it was sexual frustration


If I stay, would you put a end
to all the games you play
Can you promise me
that you will never stray
Has to be a new beginning from today,
only way I will stay
But if I go,
this will be the final curtain of the show
You have lost the best thing
that you ever known
Guess you have to learn
to make it on your own
Let me know stay or go


(Goodbye my darling)
Baby baby tell me
why your in a hurry to leave
(Goodbye my darling)
See a lot I can't believe
that this is happening to me
(Goodbye my darling)
Yeah I know I made mistakes
but this is meant to be
(Goodbye my darling)
I promise I'll do better
baby stay with me


If I stay, would you put a end
to all the games you play
Can you promise me
that you will never stray
Has to be a new beginning from today,
only way I will stay
But if I go,
this will be the final curtain of the show
You have lost the best thing
that you ever known
Guess you have to learn
to make it on your own
Let me know stay or go
If I stay, would you put a end
to all the games you play
Can you promise me
that you will never stray
Has to be a new beginning from today,
only way I will stay
But if I go,
this will be the final curtain of the show
You have lost the best thing
that you ever known
Guess you have to learn
to make it on your own
Let me know stay or go
If I stay, would you put a end
to all the games you play
Can you promise me
that you will never stray
Has to be a new beginning from today,
