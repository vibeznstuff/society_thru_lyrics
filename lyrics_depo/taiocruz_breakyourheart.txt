Whoa whoa

Now listen to me baby
Before I love and leave you
They call me heart breaker
I don't wanna deceive you


If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start,
Baby from the start.

I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart. 

Whoa whoa

There's no point trying to hide it
No point trying to evade it
I know I got a problem
Problem with misbehaving



I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart. 

Whoa whoa 

And I know karma's gonna get me back for being so cold
Like a big bad wolf I'm born to be bad and bad to the bone
If you fall for me I'm only gonna tear you apart
Told ya from the start.

I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart. 

Whoa whoa whoa
