What if I told you about my little nothing town
The two room house where I came from
The man that I got my name from
I don't even know where he is now

What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you there is no fixing me
Cause everybody has already tried

Would you stay?
Would you leave?
I could wait
It'll all come out eventually

If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I've blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way?
Could you love me anyway?

What if I told you I don't plan on staying here
My dreams are a million miles away
And I know your family is gonna want you to stay
You know what I don't blame 'em

So I'll say
What I don't want to
And I'll just pray
You want what I do

If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I've blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way?
Could you love me anyway?
Aww, could you love me anyway?

So before we go any further here
Let a week turn into another year
There some things you probably don't wanna hear
But you have to

If I told you sometimes I get jealous
Sometimes I'm half crazy
Would you say the hell with me, the hell with me
If I told you I barely know what love is
But girl if that's what this is
I don't want to let it slip away
No, no, no

Could you love me anyway?
Please
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway? (Oooooh)
Could you love me anyway?
