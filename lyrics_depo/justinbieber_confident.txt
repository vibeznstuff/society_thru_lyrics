Don't do it to me 
Oh, no, no, Oh, no, no
Don't do it to me 
Oh, no, no, Oh, no, no


Focused, I'm focused
She got a body like that
I ain't never seen nothing like that (eh, eh, eh)
Like a fantasy in front of me
I think that something special is going down
That's right I think she foreign
I think she foreign, got passports
Mi amor started slow, got faster
She gon' work some more, work some more
No stopping her now, no stopping her now


Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, lipstick on my satin sheets
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident


Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
She's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
And I'm down with it
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
She's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room


She said it's her first time (oh, ya, ya)
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn (oh, ya, ya), and I don't know why
I'm addicted, something like an addict
Got me twisted (oh, ya, ya), but still I gotta have it
Explosive, explosive. I could still smell her perfume
It's not hard to notice that I'm open
Hypnotized by the way she moves


Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident


Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
She's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
And I'm down with it
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
She's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room


She said it's her first time
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn, and I don't know why (IEH)
I'm addicted, something like an addict (chance)
Got me twisted (the rapper), but still I gotta have it (IEH)


Tattoos, piercings and she just learned to twerk
She ain't got a heart or an ass, just her brains
Gotta ask cause her ass on a learning curve
And she love to hurn the berb, I mean burn the word
That's only legal with a doctors note
Real deep pockets like a doctors coat
Stay fitted like Diddy, here back tryna rock the boat
She the first mate wanna rock the boat
She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains and Icicles
It goes her, blank, blank, and rock &amp; roll
She say, "I know, honey bunny that's a funny thing."
Watch her twerk for a goodfella
She money down with The Money Team
(She's confident)
(ARGH!)


Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
She's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
And I'm down with it
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
She's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room


She said it's her first time
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn, and I don't know why
I'm addicted, something like an addict
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it

Still I gotta have it 
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no 
But still I gotta have it
