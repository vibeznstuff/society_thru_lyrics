She's into superstitions black cats and voodoo dolls. 
I feel a premonition that girl's gonna make me fall. 
She's into new sensations new kicks in the candle light. 
She's got a new addiction for every day and night. 

She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain. 
She'll make you live her crazy life but she'll take away your pain 
like a bullet to your brain. Come On! 


Upside, inside out she's livin la vida loca 
She'll push and pull you down, livin la vida loca 
Her lips are devil red and her skin's the color mocha 
She will wear you out livin la vida loca Come On! 
Livin la vida loca, Come on! 
She's livin la vida loca. 

Woke up in New York City in a funky cheap hotel 
She took my heart and she took my money 
she must've slipped me a sleeping pill 
She never drinks the water and makes you order French Champagne 
Once you've had a taste of her you'll never be the same 
Yeah, she'll make you go insane. 



She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain. 
She'll make you live her crazy life 
but she'll take away your pain like a bullet to your brain. Come On!
