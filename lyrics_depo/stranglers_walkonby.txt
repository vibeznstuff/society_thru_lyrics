If you see me walking down the streets
And I start to cry
Each time we meet

Walk on by 
Aahh walk on by 
Make believe
I can see the tears 
Now let me grieve in private 
Cause each time I see you 
I just want to cry
Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by

I just can't get over losing you
And so if I seem so broken in pieces 

Walk on by
Aah walk on by
With foolish pride
If I can't see the tears 
Let me hide
From the tears and the sadness 
You gave me
When you said goodbye

Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by
Just go for a stroll in the trees

Walk on by 
Aahh walk on by
And make believe
That I can't see the tears 
Now let me grieve in private
Cause each time I see you 
I break down and cry 
Walk on by
Walk on by
