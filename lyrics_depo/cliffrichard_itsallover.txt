It's all over, didn't even cry,
I just stopped living when you said goodbye.

It's all over, didn't feel a thing,
I just stopped living - couldn't stand the pain.

Heather grows like leaves in September
Looks as fresh in spring
Love that warms like summer sun
Shouldn't die when winter comes.

It's all over, didn't even cry,
I just stopped living when you said goodbye.
