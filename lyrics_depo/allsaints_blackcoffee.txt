Night Swimming
Beach walking
Always silent
Never talking
Then you call my name
And I know inside I love you

Sail away
I miss you more
Until you see the shore
There I will be waiting
Anticipating

Each moment is new
Freeze the moment
Each moment is cool
Freeze the moment

I wouldnt wanna be
Anywhere else but... here
I wouldnt wanna change
Anything at all 
(Anything oh I..)

I wouldnt wanna take
Everything out on... you
Though I know I do
(Although I know I do)
Everytime I fall

Day dreaming
Chain smoking
Always laughin
Always jokin
I remain the same
Did I tell you that I love you

Brush your teeth 
And pour a cup of black coffee out 
I love to watch you do that every day
The little things that you do

Each moment is new
Freeze the moment
Each moment is cool
Freeze the moment

I wouldnt wanna be
Anywhere else but... here
I wouldnt wanna change
Anything at all 
(Anything oh I..)

I wouldnt wanna take
Everything out on... you
Though I know I do
(Although I know I do)
Everytime I fall

Hmmmmmm 
Hmmmmmm
Each moment is cool
Freeze the moment

I wouldnt wanna be
Anywhere else but... here
I wouldnt wanna change
Anything at all 
(Anything oh I..)

I wouldnt wanna take
Everything out on... you
Though I know I do
(Although I know I do)
Everytime I fall
(Everytime I fall)
(Everytime I fall)

I wouldnt wanna be
Anywhere else but... here
(Anywhere but here)
I wouldnt wanna change
(I wouldnt wanna change)
Anything at all 
(Anything oh I..)

I wouldnt wanna take
Everything out on... you
Though I know I do
(Although I know I do)
Everytime I fall

Night swimming
Beach walking
Always silent
Never talking
Then you call my name
And I know inside I love you

Sail away
I miss you more
Until you see the shore
There I will be waiting
