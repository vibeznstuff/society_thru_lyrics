I've never been here before,
Didn't know where to go,
Never met you before,
I've never been to your home,
That smells not unknown,
Foot steps made of stone,
Walking feels familiar

You can do all the things that you like to do,
All around, underground, pick a part that's new,
You can do all the things that you like to do,
All around, upside down, pick a part that's new.

People drinking on their own,
Push buttons on the phone,
Was I here once before?
Is that my voice on the phone?
That last drink on my own,
Did I ever leave at all?
Confusions familiar

You can do all the things that you like to do,
All around, underground, pick a part that's new,
You can do all the things that you like to do,
All around, upside down, pick a part that's new.

You can do all the things that you like to do,
All around, underground, pick a part that's new,
You can do all the things that you like to do,
All around, upside down, anything that's new.
You can do all the things that you like to do,
All around, underground, pick a part that's new,
You can do all the things that you like to do,
All around, upside down, pick a part that's new.
So what's new to you?
What's new to you?
What's new to you?
