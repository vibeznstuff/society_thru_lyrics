If one day you should go away
I know you say you'll always stay
Oh, but life takes funny turns at times
And has a way of chaniging minds
Though I could never be your friend
To me the end would be the end
But we've shared so much happiness,
Just remember
I know you tell me every day

You'll love me till the end of time
I tell it you just in case
Someday you are no longer mine
There's just one thing I'll ask of you
Sonce both of us has so much to lose
For the things we've made it trough
Just remember, please remember

Remember me with love baby,
Remember me with love
No matter where or when,
If you think of me again
Remember me with love
Remember me with love baby,
Remember me with love
I know you care for me,
But if one day you set me free
Remember me with love

Seems like everywhere I go
Somebody else is breaking up
I know as far as I'm concerned
With you I'll always be in love
But if one day you feel differently
All you have to do is come to me
I will let you go so easily,
But remeber, please remember

Remember me with love baby,
Remember me with love
No matter where or when,
If you think of me again
Remember me with love
Remember me with love baby,
Remember me with love
I know you care for me,
But if one day you set me free
Remember me with love
