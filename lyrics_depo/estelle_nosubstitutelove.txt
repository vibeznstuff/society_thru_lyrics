Said boy I'm not your substitute lover 

I know it would have been nice if i could have had your body 
Knowing that everybody aint been with you

But now i know the games you play

Im not your substitue lover oh no 
Said boy oh boy im not your sub lover oh no 

You know theres gonna be a fight if these chicks keep calling you at night

Said boy oh boy im not your sub lover oh no

So you besta move on (move on) 
Because i couldnt be your sub anymore
