She's the kind of girl, makes you look twice
Makes the fell as nod their heads
So fine, that every man would wanna hold her hand
It's crazy (oh yeah)
Lookin so good to me, she was so tight
Simple words just can't describe
She was something like a beauty queen from a fashion magazine
(oh maria)

Deep inside, girl I can't deny it
What I feel, I can't really hide it
Mi amor, girl my heart is true for you
I need you Maria


Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-Maria
Finest of all the sweet senoritas
Lookin so good I would like to me ya (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-Maria
I get a chill whenever I see ya
Shorty I like the way that your booty rolls (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

She's a perfect ten and she knows it
From her head down to her toes
The kind that makes you want to settle down
And just get married (oh yea)
I would do anything to be near her
Give her all I have and more
Baby girl you are the one for me
You're my pin-up fantasy (oh Maria)

Deep inside, girl I can't deny it
What I feel, I can't really hide it
Mi amor, girl my heart is true for you
I need you Maria



Baby I need you endlessly
Cause with you is where I wanna be (oh oh oh)
