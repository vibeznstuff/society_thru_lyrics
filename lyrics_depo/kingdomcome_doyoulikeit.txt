Now is the time
That we'll give it to you
Slam out the beat
Until it's black and blue
We're ready to rock
'Til the morning light
Scream at the night
'Cause you feel alright

Do you like it
Do you like it

The fever is rising
We don't wanna stop
The power to take it to the top
Doing the things
That we all love to do
I know you can feel it
Inside of you

Do you like it
Do you like it

Now you know the time is right
And you want to rock tonight
If you want to touch the sky
We can do it, you and I
Do you like it

The fire's burning
It's out of control
The blazing heart of rock and roll
Feels so much better than it did before
Just can't get enough
Coming back for more

Do you like it
Do you like it
Do you like it
Do you like it

Now you know the time is right
And you want to rock tonight
If you want to touch the sky
We can do it you and I
