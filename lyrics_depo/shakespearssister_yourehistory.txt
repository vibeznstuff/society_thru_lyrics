Well
You made your bed
Better lie in it - get back to sleep!

You should see me when you're not around
I'm a genius in this town

I'm a queen bee when the coast is clear

Now I know I don't need you
Dear.
So leave your hand like a magic man and disappear!

You're history
Like a beat up car
No good for me
Like an old film star
You're history
That's what you are
Na na na na

You're history
You're history
No good for me
No good for me
You're history
You're history
Na na na na na

You should see me from your ivory tower
I'm the hero of the hour

I'm a close friend of destiny when you're not here to bother me.
Well
You made your bed
Better lie in it
Get back to sleep!

You're history
Like ancient Rome
No good for me
Like the Dead Sea Scrolls
You're history
Everybody knows
Na na na na

You're history
You're history
My enemy
My enemy
You're history
You're history
Na na na na na

So get on your bike and take a hike right out of here!

You're history
You're history
No good for me
No good for me
You're history
You're history
Na na na na

You're history
Like a worn-out shoe
My enemy
You're nothing new
You're history
You're history
Ooh-ooh-ooh

You're history
Like a beat up car
No good for me
Like an old film star
You're history
You're history
Na na na na

You're history
Sing it girl
Let me hear you
You're history
Na na na na

You're history
Hm - my enemy
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
You're history
So long
