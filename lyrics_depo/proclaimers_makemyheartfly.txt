Please don't go rushing by
Stay and make my heart fly
Please don't go rushing by
Stay and make my heart fly

'Cause I never seem to know the time
When you're with me
You can tell it to the birds
I'll tell the bees

Please don't go rushing by
Stay and make my heart fly

I can't do any more
To get inside your door
I can't do any more
Please, let me inside your door

'Cause I never seem to know the time
When you're with me
You can tell it to the birds
I'll tell the bees

Please don't go rushing by
Stay and make my heart fly

'Cause I never seem to know the time
When you're with me
You can tell it to the birds
I'll tell the bees

Please don't go rushing by
Stay and make my heart fly
Stay and make my heart fly
Stay and make my heart fly
