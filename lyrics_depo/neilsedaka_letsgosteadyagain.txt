Down down down rudup do, let's go steady again
Down down down rudup do, let's go steady again

Let's go steady again like we did before
Let's go steady again and be lovers once more
Wear my ring around your neck like you used to do
Don't you know it's wrong to break
Come on baby let's kiss and make up

Let's go steady again like in the past
Let's show all of our friends that our love can last
I don't care who was wrong come back here where you belong
Come on baby let's go steady again

Monday, we said goodbye
Tuesday, all I did was cry
Wednesday, I almost lost my mind
Thursday, I was feeling blue
Friday, was the same way too
Never had a day sad as Saturday
Even Sunday was no fun day

Let's go steady again like we used to do
Say you're ready and then we can start anew
For seven days we didn't speak
It's been a long and lonely week
Come on baby let's go steady again
