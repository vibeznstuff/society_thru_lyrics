She's the top, she's got the world on a string 
She makes me boogie, makes me do anything, yea yea 

Hey now, touch the sky 
You've got a certain kind of look in your eyes 

Well, she's a miracle, she's all that I need 
Like the water and the air that I breathe, yea yea 

Hey now, reach the sky 
There's a certain kind of look in your smile 

And I know what love can do 
Yes I know what hearts can do 

The big love is taking the wheel 
The big love goes head over heels 
The big lust, bring it into the small world 
The bigger, the better 

Big love, waiting to catch the big one 
Head over heels, the big one 
Bring it into the small world 
I'm building the big big love 
I'm building the big big love 

It's kinda strange, a bit mysterious 
I gotta take it oh so so serious, yea yea 

Hey now, touch the sky 
You've got a certain kind of look in your eyes 

It used to be so hard so lonely at night 
Well, she's my baby and I'm feeling allright 

Hey now, move the sky 
There's a certain kind of look in that smile 

When I'm making love with her 
When I'm making love to her, yea 

The big love is taking the wheel 
The big love goes head over heels 
The big lust, bring it into the small world 
The bigger, the better 

Big love, waiting to catch the big one 
Head over heels, the big one 
Bring it into the small world 
I'm building the big big love 
I'm building the big big love 

It has to be a big thing 
It's bringing me to my knees 
Has to be a big thing 
Big thing 

Ya know what I'm saying...
