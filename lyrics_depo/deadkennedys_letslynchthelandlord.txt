The Landlord's here to visit
They're blasting disco down below
Sez, "I'm doubling up the rent
Cos the building's condemned
You're gonna help me buy City Hall" 

But we can, you know we can
But we can, you know we can
Let's lynch the landlord man 

I tell them 'turn on the water'
I tell 'em 'turn on the heat'
Tells me 'All you ever do is complain'
Then they search the place when I'm not here 

But we can, you know we can
Let's lynch the landlord
Let's lynch the landlord
Let's lynch the landlord man 

There's rats chewin' up the kitchen
Roaches up to my knees
Turn the oven on, it smells like Dachau, yeah
Til the rain pours thru the ceiling 

But we can, you know we can
Let's lynch the landlord man
