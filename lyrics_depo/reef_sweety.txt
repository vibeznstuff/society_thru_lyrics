Often I listen when people are talking
I don't know what they mean
And if I ask them to explain
They end up looking wound up at me often when in a social situation

I was so longing
I was so longing
I want it all, I want it all, 

I don't know what to do
Its not that I'm feeling out of place
I'm just adjusting to something new

I was so longing
I was so longing
I want it all, I want it all, 

na na na...
