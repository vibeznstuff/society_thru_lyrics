Wild is the wind that strips away our sins
Yours is the night, but you don't know where to begin
But I heard you say
You've got a feeling that it's just around the bend
I heard you say
Sometimes you fall into the arms of no-one at all
I mean to say that that's alright
I did what I could! 
Oh, sometimes I run
Yeah, sometimes I fall
L O V E, I'll see you later
L O V E, I'll see you later 

Yours is the fire that gets in my head
Mine is desire, so let it burn down your bed
Cause I heard about those stories, yeah
I guess everyone has
I heard them say sometimes you fall
Just on your own with no-one at all
I mean to say that that's alright
I did what I could! 

Oh, sometimes I run
Yeah, sometimes I fall
L O V E, I'll see you later
L O V E, I'll see you later 

Oh, sometimes I run
Yeah, sometimes I fall
L O V E, I'll see you later
L O V E, I'll see you later
