Tougher than the letter good
I wanna say your last name
Here we playing by the rules
But you gon' change the whole game
I don't wanna suit and shade that cool
While until the love again
Danger when you make me ooh
But I think that's a good thing

Maybe that's a bad thing, bad thing
Maybe that's a bad thing, bad thing
I'mma feel for that thing, that thing
Maybe that's a bad thing, bad thing
Maybe that's a bad thing, bad thing
I'mma feel for that thing, that thing

I don't want to ever choose
Keep it jumping like a trampoline
No matter what you put me through
You always make it worth it
We go together me and you
Three box and hoop change
And after make me say I do
And I think that's a good thing

Maybe that's a bad thing, bad thing
Maybe that's a bad thing, bad thing
I'mma feel for that thing, that thing
Maybe that's a bad thing, bad thing
Maybe that's a bad thing, bad thing
I'mma feel for that thing, that thing


But in conclusion, is the only time we losing
We get deluded by these illusions, constant confusions
And every movement, any time that we do 
What could be a great 
Gets neglected, feel my solar plexus tryna get you back babe
Tell me where it's at, where it's at, at, at
Gotta pack of that yack, yack, yack
That'll probably snap that back
Hit the cat till it's cataracts
But you like the sound of that
Now bring it back, we the perfect match to start a culture, might start it happen
Don't get too attached, cause I adapt to change quick see
My way of living fast, be on my switchin' lanes shit
You're sick of all that anguish, cause you know how that game be
If you ain't speaking that dollar bill, then you ain't speaking that language
I'm, dancin' with this little devil
I, condescend when usually I'm on a higher level
Sip a little Red Bull
Now we growing wings, she's the girl of my dreams
I could, give her my last name but that's a bad thing

Maybe that's a bad thing, bad thing
Maybe that's a bad thing, bad thing
I'mma feel for that thing, that thing
Maybe that's a bad thing, bad thing
Maybe that's a bad thing, bad thing
I'mma feel for that thing, that thing
