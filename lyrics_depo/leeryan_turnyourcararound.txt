Well its not about them
Its all about us
Can you hear it again
and just take on trust
yeah you still got a way
to get out of this
One story town

So you swallow your pride
Whe you're fillin' with gas
and there aughin inside about you kicking your arse
And you gotta stand up, if you dont
then there just falling down

So why dont you
Turn your car around
Forget your way back home
cause its not me there anymore
Turn you car around
We're better off alone
I'll get myself up off the floor
So i'll tell you itsblack
but you know that its white
I say everythings cool and
you dont have to fight
and theres nothing outside
in the dark there
just waiting for you
and i wish it was true.
