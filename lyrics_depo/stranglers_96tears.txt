Too many teardrops for one heart to be crying
Too many teardrops for one heart to carry on

You're way on top now since you left me
You're always laughing way down at me
But watch out now I'm gonna get down
We'll be together for just a little while
And then I'm gonna put you way down here
And you'll start crying 96 tears

Cry, you're gonna cry

And when the sun comes up I'll be on top
You'll be right down there looking up

I'm gonna get to you but I know now
You're gonna cry 96 tears
You're gonna cry 96 tears

You're gonna cry 96 tears
You're gonna cry 96 tears
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry now
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry now

Too many teardrops, all night long
Too many teardrops

Cry, cry, cry, cry now
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry now
96 tears
All night long now

You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry now
96 tears
Cry, cry, cry now
96 tears
Cry, cry, cry now
96 tears

You're gonna cry 96 tears
You're gonna cry 96 tears
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry now
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry now
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry now
