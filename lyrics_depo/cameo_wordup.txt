Yo, pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show you so tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother, your sister and your mama too
'Cause we're about to throw down and you'll know just what to do

Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
Glide by the people as they start to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance quick, mama
Come on, baby, tell me what's the word

Word up (Up, up), everybody say
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway
Word up (Up, up), it's the code word
No matter where you say it you'll know that you'll be heard

Now all you sucker DJ's who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason and we know the reason why
You try to put on those airs and act real cool
But you've got to realize that you're acting like fools

Give us music, we can use it, we need to dance
We don't have the time for psychological romance
No romance, no romance, no romance for me, mama
Come on, baby, tell me what's the word

Word up (Up, up), everybody say
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway, ow

Ow, dial L for love

Ah, hey, hey
Ah, hey, hey
Now just come on, all you people say

(W-O-R-D up, W-O-R-D up) Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
(W-O-R-D up, W-O-R-D up) Oooh!
(W-O-R-D up) Hey, hey
(W-O-R-D up) He-hey

Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, oooh, oooh, oooh, woh
Tell me like that, like that

Say it like that, now, now, yeah
That's the word, everybody's got to know the word
Like that, come on

Ow, take me real low
