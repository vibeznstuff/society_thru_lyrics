You said your peace 
It's killing me 
I can't believe 
It's over, over, over

You're not the enemy
But underneath
You don't agree
Take comfort that 
It's over, over

Your hands tied
You feel shy
Believe I'm on your side
Now and forever
Over 

Jealousy won't get you anything that you lost 
Jealousy it will never be what it was 
Jealousy well I'm afraid of what I've become 
Jealousy it feels like everything's come undone 

You're not the enemy 
But underneath 
You don't agree 
Take comfort that it's over 
Over
There's an urgency 
A dire need For the remedy 
Take comfort that it's over
Over 

Jealousy won't get you anything that you lost 
Jealousy it will never be what it was 
Jealousy well I'm afraid of what I've become 
Jealousy it feels like everything's come undone 

No matter what the price, they can't take me 
No matter what the price, they can't take me
No matter what the price, they can't take me 
No matter what the price, they can't take me 
No matter what the price, they can't take me
