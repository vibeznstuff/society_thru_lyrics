I feel like the time has come
A fearless rescue from everyone
Who made you the master?
The lady caster, I found you looking for a good time
I was out in exile perfecting my style
I knew you wanted a reaction

Hit me! Harder! I’m getting re-wired
I flip the switch that make you feel electric
Even! Faster! Than before
I'm gonna light 'em up with you
I'm gonna light 'em up with you

Try to keep up, you scatter brain
She will enter through your vein
Who was your creator?
The one who made you, the flame I need to heat the silver
You’d bring Gods to their knees pick out the bad seeds
Relieve the generals of theirs duties

Hit me! Harder! I’m getting re-wired
I flip the switch that make you feel electric
Even! Faster! Than before
I'm gonna light 'em up with you
I'm gonna light 'em up with you

Who made you the master?
The Lady caster, I found you looking for a good time
Now this blood and glitter, it tastes so bitter
There’s no retreat for I surrender

Hit me! Harder! I’m getting re-wired
I flip the switch that make you feel electric
Even! Faster! Than before
I'm gonna light 'em up with you
I'm gonna light 'em up with you
