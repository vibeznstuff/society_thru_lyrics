Sister girl
I know you don't understand
But you going have to understand he's my man now
What you had is gone
Our thing is sweet
Our thing is stronger than any lie you can tell on me
He knows my heart and that's the part
Yo roots are dug up
So you might as well give up
I see your intentions
You can't handle the truth
He let you go a long time ago
Now it's time to turn him loose

You're getting the way of what I'm feeling
You're getting the way of what I'm feeling
You're getting the way of what I'm feeling
You're getting the way of what I'm feeling

Telling him that you seen me up 24th Street
