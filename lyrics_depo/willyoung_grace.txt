Feeling so strange I'm seeing you clearly now 
Your beauty's deadlier everyday 
All these people am I the only one 
Who found you out 
Is no one willing to say, willing to say, willing to say 

Why don't you slow down 
Turn your head round 
Been treading on hearts 
That are giving in with a little 
Grace - you're getting away with it 
Words - but nothing to say with it 
You smile and take what you need in any way that you please 
Isn't it a shame 
You've 
Nothing to show from these 
Lies - I told you you'd pay for it 
Lonely are the days of your life 

You spoke in rhymes and rhythms 
The sweetest sounds 
They drew me in like a moth to a flame 
Oh, all these people you hurt along the way 
Will haunt you now 
'Cos things are going to change, going to change, going to change 

Why don't you slow down 
Turn your head round 
Been treading on hearts 
That are giving in with a little 
Grace - you're getting away with it 
Words - but nothing to say with it 
You smile and take what you need in any way that you please 
Isn't it a shame 
You've 
Nothing to show from these 
Lies - I told you you'd pay for it 
Lonely are the days of your life 

You're beginning to lose 
Things are fading in front of your eyes 

You've a long way to fall 
Before you even realize 
That this loneliness hurts 
Lonely will be the days of your life 
Oh 

Grace - you're getting away with it 
Words and nothing to say with it 
You blame but you're not ashamed of it 
Hurt - you don't feel the pain of it 
Lie - straight in the face of it 
Your mind - you should be afraid of it 
Your grace - you're getting away with it 
Nothing to get in my way 
With a little grace - you're getting away with it 
Words and nothing to say with it 
Lonely are the days of your life 

Lonely are the days 
You lie - straight in the face of it 
Your mind, your mind - you should be afraid 
You're heading for trouble
