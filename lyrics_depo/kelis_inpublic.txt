See its this thing (Kelis)
I like bein seen outside
I'm my ride (Your tasty)
I like it everywhere (cookies tasty)
(Tasty)
(Ohh Yeah Let's Go)

He was next to me
Our flight was supposed to leave around 2:53
All I wanted to see
Is what would he do if i dropped down to my knees
I wanna play a game
Is someone coming, it don't matter just the same.
Try something fun with me
Let's take our clothes off all over the balcony

Let's get it on in public
Just let it go I promise that you'll love it
Oh daddy don't you wanna be my subject
Ooh let's get it on in public Ooh

Don't try to run from me
I'll make your toes curl up and make your body scream
Come take a walk with me
We can do it over there by all the trees
Drive this car real fast
I'll lay my head down and ill make your body blast ow

Let's get it on in public
Just let it go I promise that you'll love it
Oh daddy don't you wanna be my subject
Ooh let's get it on in public Ooh

Let's make a movie baby
Can we get away with it (Open your legs) (I'll be your animal)
All lights on
I like it when we do it to this song
Let's make a movie baby
Can we get away with it (Your so nasty)
All lights on
I like it when we do it to this song (Talk To Me)


The pussy or the mouth, that is the question
Like Shakespeare but my erection is the case here
I ain't got time to drive you all the way home
But instead I can slide you to a club bathroom or a restaurant men's room
Then I can zoom in your womb.
We both get what we want
Then we can assume
We doin what we want
Smokin that bud and chillin'
But first I gotta nut before anything you willin?
You wit it, its animal behavior.
La chic, la freak out, with the sexy beast ma who slays ya
This is for the mature who love natural love making
Outdoors, On the hood of your car
Nas is good at it all when it comes to gettin it raw
Do I have to convince ya naw
We don't need hotel key
We jump in the truck and stain everything up.
Slide your g-string up

Let's get it on in public
Just let it go I promise that you'll love it
Oh daddy don't you wanna be my subject
Ooh let's get it on in public Ooh
Let's get it on in public
Just let it go I promise that you'll love it
Oh daddy don't you wanna be my subject
Ooh let's get it on in public Ooh
