In this land right now, some are insane, and they're in charge

To hell with poverty the check will arrive we'll turn the Boast again
To hell with poverty the check will arrive we'll turn to Boast again

In my arms we shall begin with none of the rocks and There's no charge
In this land right now, some are insane, and they're in charge
To hell with poverty we'll get drunk on cheap wine
To hell with poverty
