I could talk to you for days
You make me laugh one thousand ways
Not realising (you fill me up)
Like hot water (in my tea cup)

I'm enchanted by your smile
I must admit it took a while
For me to see that (this was something)
More than (he's my friend, it's nothing)

I hope to God, you feel the way I feel
Cause this could be amazing
Something so super real

There's something about you
And you don't even know it
I'm telling you now that you got me good
There's something about you
And I can't help but show it
Damn right you got me good
Now I'm not alone
With you I'm whole, I've gotta let you know
You got me good

Your style, your voice, your points of view
The good the bad and ugly too
Boy I'll take it (give it to me)
I'll be careful (give it to me)

Addiction don't come close to this
Official is what this sh- is
Still I can't say it
No I can't say that (I'm in love)

I hope to God, you feel the way I feel
Cause this could be amazing
Something so super real

There's something about you
And you don't even know it
I'm telling you now that you got me good
There's something about you
And I can't help but show it
Damn right you got me good
Now I'm not alone
With you I'm whole, I've gotta let you know
You got me good

I just wanna
Be your all and all
I just wanna be the one to make you fall
I wanna take you away
I want you to be for me
I want you here with me forever
Be my holiday

Let me take you away
There's something about you

There's something about you
And you don't even know it
I'm telling you now that you got me good
There's something about you
And I can't help but show it
Damn right you got me good
Now I'm not alone
With you I'm whole, I've gotta let you know
You got me good
