Tell a sound bwoy back off
Nobody move in for the world...


Turn up the dutty bass
Them um’e cut them face 
Tell ‘em pick up the bass 
A we’a run the place 
Sound bwoy’a chase 
Me tell ‘em give me space 
Them in a rat race 
But’a we’a run the place 


Tell ‘em call the fire brigade 
Be’ca we smell some speaker burning, speaker burning 
Ring the alarm sound bwoy 
You wa’you high scream jump and sound

Tell a sound bwoy back off 
Nobody move in for the world to see we cop off

No we have the world fucking club’a sho dash him out

Tha bwoy cant fool me me cause’a proper school me 
Roll it like a dice and then we kill him like a lordy 
Sound bwoy just gets slow 


Tell ‘em call the fire brigade 
Be’ca we smell some speaker burning, speaker burning 
Ring the alarm sound bwoy 
You wa’you high scream jump and sound
