Do U really love me (do U still love me)
Really care
Do U really need me (do U still need me)
Need me there
Do U really want me (do U still want me)
Do U dare
Do U still care

Do you remember the time when you were mine
Brighten up my day like a star would shine
We had no money, honey, but we didn't care
We had something special
Like no other lover could compare
We had dreams and desires, aspirations entire
When we made love you'd hear the angels in choir
Was a love of lifetime precious like a goldmine
But you had to go - where, I don't know
And now I spend my night time sleeping alone
In bed by the phone
So why don't you call me
So why don't you call me
Tell me

Do U really love me (do U still love me)
Really care
Do U really need me (do U still need me)
Need me there
Do U really want me (do U still want me)
Do U dare
Do U still care

Are you missing me too
Like I'm missing you
Do U still care

I know, just like a rainbow everything must end
Sometime, someway
Somehow, someway
But the bloom was immature, it ended premature
Two hearts broken by soft words spoken
In the garden of beginning, our flowers grew the same
I guess they grew apart, from the wind and the rain
Now I'm living in pain, will it remain - tell me

Do U really love me (do U still love me)
Really care
Do U really need me (do U still need me)
Need me there
Do U really want me (do U still want me)
Do U dare
Do U still care

Really care
Do U really want me
Do U dare
Do U still care

Do U really love me (do U still love me)
Really care
Do U really need me (do U still need me)
Need me there
Do U really want me (do U still want me)
Do U dare
Do U still care

Really care (thinking about you)
Do U really need me (do U still need me)

Are you missing me too
Like I'm missing you
Do U still care
