The maestro 
Nice flow 
Hot like nitro 
Cool as ice though 
That type of docodimy 
Y'all know it's gotta be 
Who else could it be but me 
Rub your eyes but hold the big Billy 
It's dream supreme bean straight from Philly 
It's the eclectic female attractor rapper slash actor 
Right back at ya 
And to the next millinium many come but few are chosen 
See me servin' like the U.S. Open 
Another type of hustler listed at Blockbuster 
Go and ask a movie usher 
Who is he, he or she 
SFP, movies CD's, and TV's, but uh uh 
'cause the day I take a break from that 
As I rule where a tank of gas take me at 
I used to rock these 
Red, I rock Z's 
Now I rock the MB's 
With twelves and V's 
Today sun up high 
In the sky 
From NY 
La la me to MI 
(1) 
Just Cruisin' 
Where, baby, I don't care 
Just Cruisin' 
As long as you take me there 
Just Cruisin' 
Somewhere to clear my mind 
Just Cruisin' 
Just Cruisin' 
Easy wrote a sixty 
Flossin' ninety degrees 
Sony cartridges, ten CD's each 
Reach to the beach 
South side leanin' 
It ain't often I'm off and I'm for the top down 
drop down 
Got me hot now heated up can't stop now 
What up cutie what sure sure is cooking now 
Yo I know 
I'm spoken for can't hurt lookin' no 
Pop CD's, B-I-G's, and Tupac's 
While cruisin' on the blocks 
Hittin' the hot spots 
Got my celly on O-F-F 
Golden arches got my belly goin' oh yes yes 
So let's just ease on down ease on down the road 
No pager roll my hip 
As I rollin' my whip 
'Cause today I'm on the solo creek 
Man, why you think I be workin' all week 
I'm (1, 1) 
Sun settin' in the S-K-Y 
Must say I've had the best day I 
Tryin' to find an exit 
A place to chill not to hectic 
So I can spend some time with Will 
Let the sun shine to the moonlight clearin' my mind 
Soul search, see what I find 
If I'm being the best lover and friend 
Am I being the best daddy I can 
I pray I am 
And I feel good today 
Reminiece as I'm cruisin' around the way 
Roll tight passed the park where I used to play 
Can't think of a better way to spend my day 
Uh, still findin' my way 
Still growin' 
Petrol rowin' 
Move soon showin' 
Gots to get goin' losing the light 
And the freaks come out at night
