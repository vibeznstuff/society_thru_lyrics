And hey! Would you
Like to look
Outside sometimes? (No)
I'm just with my
Friends online
And there's things we'd like to change
Next thing you'll find you're
Reading 'bout yourself
On a plane, fame, what a shame
Oh, well, just keep looking, looking, looking, looking

And love me (Yeah)
If that's what you wanna do (Oh, yeah)
And love me (Yeah)
If that's what you wanna do (Oh, yeah)

You've been reading 'bout yourself
On a plane, fame for a change
Caught up in fashion
Karcrashian panache
A bag of bash for passion
You've got a beautiful face but got nothing to say (Oh!)
You look famous, let's be friends
And portray we possess something important
And do the things we like, meaning

We've just come to represent
A decline in the standards of what we accept
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, no

And love me (Yeah, oh)
If that's what you wanna do (Oh, yeah)
And love me (Love me, yeah)
If that's what you wanna do (Oh, yeah)

Oh, so sack off your calendar
Give it to the people
Be the man that
Gets 'em up on their feet
Say "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

Love me (Yeah, oh)
And love me (Yeah)
If that's what you wanna do (Oh)
