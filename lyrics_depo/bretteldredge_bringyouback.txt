It happened on a Sunday,
Outside and the sun was shinning.
That look on your face
Oh it hit me so hard inside.
I could see how the light was fading
From your pretty blue eyes and
All I needed were the right words,
But they were so hard to find.

In a second my world changed
So fast that my heart was breaking
I wrapped my arms around you
And I just kept saying your name
I put your hands in my hands
And we dropped to the floor both crying
At the moment that your heart gave up on us

I told you,
I'll bring you back, I'll bring you back,
I'll bring you back to love
I will, bring you back, I'll bring you back,
I'll bring you back to love

I kissed your tears all falling down
Said baby, you'll always be the one
Aw I'm never going to turn around
Your all the life that I have in these lungs

We can all be scared ticks
Never certain of what it is we want
All the fears we should confess
Holding our breath just dying to speak up

In a second my world changed
So fast that my heart was breaking
I wrapped my arms around you
And I just kept saying your name
I put your hands in my hands
And we dropped to the floor both crying
At the moment that your heart gave up on us

I told you,
I'll bring you back, I'll bring you back,
I'll bring you back to love
I will, bring you back, I'll bring you back,
I'll bring you back to love
I remember that night at your mama's house
We were so in love, finally said it out loud
I got down on my knees,
Said you're the best thing that ever happened to me
You walking down the aisle,
I remember it now,
I remember your smile

I told you,
I'll bring you back, I'll bring you back,
I'll bring you back to love
I will, bring you back, I'll bring you back,
I'll bring you back to love
Yeahhhhh
I'll bring you back to love
I'll bring you back to love
