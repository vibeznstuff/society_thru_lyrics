She walks into the outhouse
the cold night breathes into her face
the flies are standin' still now
the moon it spills through the place

and she starts wonderin' what its like to be
liked by everyone and like everyone be just
like anyone and just wants to be so
just like anyone, just like anyone

she reaches through the darkness
her fingers touch the porcelain seat
she spins and pulls her pants down
the cold air holds her like a thief

and she starts wonderin what they mean
do they just mean to be mean
and thinkin' bout the scene
do they just want to be seen
try not to seem so just like anyone,
just like anyone

the door comes screechin' open
she walks into the evening air
she disappears in the darkness
all's left, the faint smell of her hair

she starts wonderin' what its like to be
liked by everyone and like everyone
be just like anyone and just wants to be so
just like anyone and wonderin what they mean
do they just mean to be mean and thinkin' bout
the scene do they just want to be seen
try not to seem so just like anyone

just like anyone
