She is not scared to die..
The best things in life drive her to cry.
Crucify then learn..
(take so much away from inside you, makes no sence, 
you know he can't guide you, he's your fucking shoulder to lean on, be strong!)
Sit and watch me burn..
She's led to believe, that it be ok,
look at your face, scarred in dismay,
but times have changed, and so have you..
I think I'd rather crucify then learn
(take so much away from inside you, makes no sence, 
you know he can't guide you, he's your fucking shoulder to lean on, be strong!)
Sit and watch me burn..
I'd like to take you down, and show you
deep inside, my life my inner workin
so smell and lack of inner pride,
to touch upon the surface, is not for
what it seems, I take away
my problems, but only in my dreams.
(take so much away from inside you, makes no sence, 
you know he can't guide you, he's your fucking shoulder to lean on, be strong!)
Crucify the learn..
(take so much away from inside you, makes no sence, 
you know he can't guide you, he's your fucking shoulder to lean on, be strong!)
Crucify then learn..
Sit and watch me burn..
