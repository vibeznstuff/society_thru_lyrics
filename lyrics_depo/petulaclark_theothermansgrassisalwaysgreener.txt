Life is never what it seems 
We're always searching in our dreams 
To find that little castle in the air 
When worry starts to cloud the mind, 
It's hard to leave it all behind 
And just pretend you haven't got a care 

There's someone else in your imagination 
You wish that you were standing in their shoes 
You'd change your life without much hesitation 
But would you if you really had to choose? 

So, don't look around 
Get your feet on the ground 
It's much better by far 
To be just who you are 

The other man's grass is always greener 
The sun shines brighter on the other side 
The other man's grass is always greener 
Some are lucky, some are not 
But just be thankful for what you've got 

Many times, it seems to me 
There's someone else I'd rather be 
Living in a world of make-believe 
To stay in bed 'til nearly three 
With nothing there to worry me 
Would seem to be the life I might achieve 

But deep inside, I know I'm really lucky 
With happiness I've never known before 
And just as long as you are there beside me 
I know that I could ask for nothing more 

Then living can start 
With the love in your heart 
So, with you all the time, 
All the treasures I've longed for are mine 

The other man's grass is always greener 
The sun shines brighter on the other side 
The other man's grass is always greener 
Some are lucky, some are not 
But I'm so thankful for what I've got 

The other man's grass is always greener 
The sun shines brighter on the other side 
The other man's grass is always greener 
Some are lucky, some are not 
But I'm so thankful for what I've got
