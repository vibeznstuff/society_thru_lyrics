Love spreads her arms, waits there for the nails
I forgive you boy, I will prevail
Too much to take, some cross to bear
I'm hiding in the trees with a picnic, she's over there
Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah

She didn't scream, she didn't make a sound
I forgive you boy, but don't leave town
Cold black skin, naked in the rain
Hammer flash in the lightning
They're hurting her again


Let me put you in the picture
Let me show you what I mean
The messiah is my sister
Ain't no king man she's my queen


I have a dream, I've seen the light
Don't put it out, say she's alright
Yeah she's my sister

She didn't scream, she didn't make a sound
I forgive you boy, but don't leave town
Cold black skin, naked in the rain
Hammer flash in the lightning
They're hurting her again
Oh Oh



I have a dream, I've seen the light
Don't put it out, says she's alright 
Yeah she's my sister!
