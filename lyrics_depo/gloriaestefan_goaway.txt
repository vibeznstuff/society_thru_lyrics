Go away
Won't you just go away
Go away
Don't you come back one day
Take your stuff
Take all of your precious things
Leave right now
Who knows what tomorrow brings

Stay away
Won't you please stay away
Live your life
But live it real far away
Save yourself
There's no way to get it all
Look around
The writing is on the wall

And when you go
I won't miss you at all
And when you go
I'll be having a ball
You will see
Thoughts of you
Won't ever cross my mind
It's the truth
Don't mean to be unkind

But people have the right to party
And you won't let them have their fun
See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya
Auf wiedersehen, Au Revoir, Shalom

'Cause people have the right to party
And we're not waiting 'till you're gone
Ciao, Bye Bye, Hasta la vista
Fare thee well, Adios, So long

Go away
Would you please go away
Go away
You're outta here come what may
Hit the road
Don't bother to say goodbye
Don't care how
Don't even matter why

And when you go
I won't miss you at all
And when you go
I'll be having a ball
You will see
Thoughts of you
Won't ever cross my mind
It's the truth
Don't mean to be unkind

'Cause people have the right to party
And you won't let them have their fun
See ya would, wouldn't wanna be ya
Toodle-lou, Au Revoir,  Shalom

And people have the right to party
And we're not waiting 'till you're gone
Ciao, Bye Bye, Hasta la vista
Fare thee well, Adios, So long

Ciao, Bye Bye, Hasta la vista
Fare thee well, Adios, So long
