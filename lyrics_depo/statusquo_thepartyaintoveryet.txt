There's a trouble wind blowing through my crazy life
I feel the chill begin, it's gonna be a long long night
I hear the thunder roll, but i dont fear the lightning strike
'cause deep inside i know
I'm gonna make it through alright

So let the walls come tumbling down
Bring on the last sunset
I ain't moving to heartbreak town
The party ain't over yet
Yeh, let the devil do his worst
But don't take any bets
That life has finally quenched my thirst
The party ain't over yet

Every drop of rain that ever fell into my eyes
Helps me ride this pain, they were a blessing in disguise
And i know in time, this'll soon be yesterday
There's nothing i can't climb, i've got the will to find the way

So let the walls come tumbling down
Bring on the last sunset
I ain't moving to heartbreak town
The party ain't over yet
Yeh, let the devil do his worst
But don't take any bets
That life has finally quenched my thirst
The party ain't over yet

So when the morning comes, i'll do more than just survive
I'll walk in to the sun, and live until i die

So let the walls come tumbling down
Bring on the last sunset
I ain't moving to heartbreak town
The party ain't over yet
Yeh, let the devil do his worst
But don't take any bets
That life has finally quenched my thirst
The party ain't over yet

The party ain't over yet
The party ain't over yet
The party ain't over yet
The party ain't over yet
