I got the 1st flight out when I finished off the tour
Because I missed you
I even flew home a day too soon all
Because I couldn’t wait to kiss you

Oh, how she will be loved
Was the one thing stuck in my mind
And how tonight would be
Remembered for the rest of your life


I never thought that I’d do something like that
When I saw you two, it hit me like a heart attack
(oh no)
How could you let somebody into (our door)
How could you bring him home

I never thought I’d loose my temper like that
now it's a fucked up situation, he ain’t coming back
(oh no)
How could you please another man (on our floor)
How could you bring him home


I know you know I passed on every girl
Because I thought I really love you
And you know that I never put anyone or anything above you
Because I loved you

And it was that love (it was that love)
That made me loose my head, and now it was too late
One day, too soon
You’ll regret it for the rest of your day

Please god forgive for what I did
This thing will stay for as long as I live
Because if you walk in and see what I see
I know any man would’ve done just the same

Please god forgive (no) for what I did (no)
This thing will stay for as long as I live
Because if you walk in (no) and see what I see (no)
