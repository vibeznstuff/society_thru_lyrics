Like a Fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your loves still strong
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

In that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Ooh baby, here I am signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours


Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours (signed, sealed yeah)

I've done alot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean (wrap me up)
Hey, hey yea, yea, didn't I, oh baby (c'mon)

Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touched them they did nothing, girl
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours, oh I'm yours

Oo-wee babe you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you are my heart's only desire
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours


Here I am baby (unwrap me baby)
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(got the future in your hand)
Here I am baby (unwrap me baby)
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(got the future in your hand)

Hold my hand, let me know you can
Hold my hand, let me know you can
Tell me what you want me to do
Hold my hand let me know you can
Here I am baby, baby (That's right)
Hold my hand let me know you can
Here I am baby, baby

Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am pretty baby
Here I am baby (unwrap me baby)
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours (signed, sealed, delivered)
Here I am pretty baby (Where you at)
Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am pretty baby (sing to me now)
Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours (signed, sealed, delivered)
Sing a little more
Baby, baby, bay
Here I am pretty baby
Blue, Angie Stone, Stevie
That'll work
