I've got a pocket full of holes.
Head in the clouds, the king of fools.
You've got a ribbon of rainbows,

Yeah, you've gotta be out of your mind - crazy.

So if I'm dreaming don't wake me tonight.
If this is all wrong, I don't want it right.
'Cause you're the one sure thing 
when I get lost in the game once again.
Hey, I'm a lucky guy without a reason and I don't understand.

Well, you've gotta be crazy, baby, 
to want a guy like me (to want a guy like me). 
Yeah, you've gotta be out of your mind - crazy (crazy crazy crazy).
Well, there must be some kind of mistake to give your heart away. 
Yeah, you've gotta be out of your mind crazy.
