I've tried so hard to make you see 
That I'd be what you want me to be 
But no matter what I do 
I just can't get through to you 
You don't want to love me 
Or are you tired of me? 

Ohh take my heart 
That's all I've got to give 
If you don't want me 
I don't want to live 
Don't run away to somebody new 
Nobody needs your love more than I do 
Nobody needs your love more than I do 

Why can't it be like before? 
Don't you need me anymore? 
Why do I go on this way? 
You don't hear a word I say 
If you care about me 
Please don't leave without me 

Ohh take my heart 
That's all I've got to give 
If you don't want me 
I don't want to live 
And baby please don't say that we're through 
Nobody needs your love more than I do
