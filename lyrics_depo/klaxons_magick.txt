Magick, without tears
Magick, without tears
Magick, without tears
The magick comandeer

The way to mother noose
The way to suck an egg
The way to golden dawn 
The way to Koh Phangan

The glitter on the snow
the place to always go
Do what you will
Do what you will

The glitter on the snow
the place to always go
Do what you will
Do what you will

Magick, without tears
Magick, without tears
Magick, without tears
The magick comandeer

The way to mother noose
The way to suck an egg
The way to golden dawn 
The way to Koh Phangan

The glitter on the snow
the place to always go
Do what you will
Do what you will

The glitter on the snow
the place to always go
Do what you will
Do what you will

The virtue of the voice
The view from devil's town
The city with tipped-on tongue
The broken silver wand

The glitter on the snow
the place to always go
Do what you will
Do what you will

Magick, without tears
Magick, without tears
Magick, without tears
The magick comandeer
