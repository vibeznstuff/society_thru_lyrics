Country roads, take me home
To the place where I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is older there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountain
Blowing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place where I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

All my memories gather round her
Minor's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, blowing in the sky
Misty taste of moonshine
Teardrops in my eye

Country roads, take me home
To the place where I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

I hear her voice in the morning hour
She calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
And driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should've been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads, take me home
To the place where I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
