Could it be magic?
Could it be a fantasy?
Maybe I'm dreaming
'Cause it sure seems to get to me
You say that you want me
Say there'll be no-one else
Make me no promises
'Cause we both know only time will tell 

Is this real or just a moment in time?
We got such a good thing
Aint nothing coming close to this high
Does it get any better in this life?
We got such a good thing
Our bodies just melt into one
When we're loving each other it feels so right 

Got such a good thing
(Good thing)
Got such a good thing
(Good thing) 

From the beginning it's like I could read your mind
I knew what you were thinking
When I looked into your eyes
You give me that feeling
That's keeping me warm inside
Now I'll be happy to stay by your side
'Cause we got something that is so hard to find 

We got such a good thing
(Good thing)
Ain't nothing coming close to this high
Does it get any better in this life?
We got such a good thing
Our bodies just melt into one
When we're loving each other it feels so right 

Got such a good thing
(Good thing)
Got such a good thing
(Good thing) 

Oh baby
Come with me
All the signs say it was meant to be
Sometimes love is such a mystery
(Love is such a mystery)
But it seems so clear to me 

Got such a good thing
(Good thing)
Got such a good thing
(Got such a good thing)
(Good thing) 

I've got such a good thing 

We got such a good thing
Aint nothing coming close to this high
Does it get any better in this life?
(Got such a good thing)
We got such a good thing
Our bodies just melt into one
When we're loving each other it feels so right 

Got such a good thing 

We got such a good thing
Aint nothing coming close to this high
Does it get any better in this life?
(Got such a good thing)
We got such a good thing
Our bodies just melt into one
When we're loving each other it feels so right 

Got a good thing
