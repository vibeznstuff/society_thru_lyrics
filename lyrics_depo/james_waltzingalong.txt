Help comes when you need it most
I'm cured for laughter
Mood swings
Not sure I can cope
My life's in plaster

May your mind set you free
May your heart lead you on
May your mind let you be
May your heart lead you on

These wounds are all self imposed
A life's no disaster
All roads lead on to death row
Who knows what's after

May your mind be wide open
May your heart be strong
May your minds will be broken
By this heartfelt song
May your mind set you free
May your heart lead you on
May your mind let you be
May your heart lead you on
May your eyes let you see
May your heart lead you on
May your mind be wide open
May your heart lead you on
