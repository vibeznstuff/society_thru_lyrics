When the big guns start to shooting
With their bullets of deception
With the smile upon your face
Going from second hand to almost new
Well I try to live life eye to eye
But I say I find it far too tall

Show me one more sign
Give me one more time
Cos you give me, you give me
You gimme, gimme, gimme temptation

Sing along, sing along baby
Sing along for the love of the children

And if this was to be true
Say I'd give all the tea in china
And maybe, all the tulips
In amsterdam

Well I try to live life eye to eye
But I say I find it far too tall

Show me one more sign
Give me one more time
Cos you give me, you give me
You gimme, gimme, gimme temptation

First you make me move
Until I'm so damn close
Take me back again, take me back again
Say I'm mighty thankful
But it's much too easy
Paying dues and learning vices
But no, but no, but oh no
You won't waste my angry spirit

Show me one more sign
Give me one more time
Cos you give me, give me
You gimme, gimme, gimme temptation

I want peace, love and understanding
To last throughout my life

Sing along, sing along baby
Sing along for the love of the children
