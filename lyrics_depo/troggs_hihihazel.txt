Hi, Hi Hi Hazel, nice to see you in the neighbourhood
Looking good, Hi Hi Hazel, when I saw you go walking by
Closed my eyes, I said, now that girl takes some beatin'
Get a load of those fancy clothes now
Won't ask her, who she's meetin'

Hi Hi, Hi Hi Hazel, I'd say you won't be short of the dime
Big time, Hi Hi Hazel, mind, you're lookin' different class
What a gas, don't seems so long ago I knew ya
You were just a little kid then, won't ask what happened to ya
Hi, Hi Hi Hazel, great to see you back home

Don't seems so long ago I knew ya
You were just a little kid then, won't asked what happened to ya
Hi Hi, Hi Hi Hazel, great to see you make good, mm
Always knew that you would
