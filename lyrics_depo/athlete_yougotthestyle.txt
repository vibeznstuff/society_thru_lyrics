Oh no
Gone and put my foot in it again
Think back i can't believe that it was me who said that
Last time
I promised i'd bite my tongue until i counted to ten
(five six seven eight nine and ten)
I said oh it's getting hot in here
Must be something in the atmosphere
Oh oh-oh oh oh

Oh it's getting hot in here
Must be something in the atmosphere
Oh i could be laughing about it
And making the most of the true british climate
Oh it's getting hot in here
Must be something in the atmosphere
Oh oh-oh oh oh

I've seen
The tension on the high street growing lately
It seems that you have to be careful who you look at
Sometimes
I can't see things the way you see them
But this is our home

I said
Oh it's getting hot in here
Must be something in the atmosphere
Oh i could be laughing about it
And making the most of the true british climate
Oh it's getting hot in here
Must be something in the atmosphere
Oh oh-oh oh oh

Yeah you got the style
And we've got the style
And they got the style
And everybody's got it

And you got the style
And we've got the style
And they got the style
And everybody's got it

And you got the style
And we've got the style
Oh oh

Oh it's getting hot in here
Must be something in the atmosphere
Oh i could be laughing about it
And making the most of the true british climate
Oh it's getting hot in here
Must be something in the atmosphere
Oh oh-oh oh oh
