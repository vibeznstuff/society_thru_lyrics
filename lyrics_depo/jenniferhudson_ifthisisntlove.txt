I'm calling his phone up just to tell him how much
I really love him cause he's everything I want
He listens to me, cares for me
So I truly believe

God sent me an angel up from above
That's gonna love me for life
Might as well be perfect
Only because it's the only way
I can describe, so


If this isn't love
Tell me what it is, cause i can be be dreaming and just plain crazy

If this isn't love
Tell me what it is, cause I never felt like this baby

If this isn't love

L-o-v-e what is it to me?
L-o-v-e Oh...
If this isn't love 


I'm selfish cause I don't wanna share
Him, with nobody not even those
People that came before me
But see I never believe.

God sent me an angel up from above
That's gonna love me for life
Might as well be perfect
Only because it's the only way
I can describe, so


If this isn't love
Tell me what it is, I could be dreaming or just plain crazy

If this isn't love (No)
Tell me what it is, cause I never felt like this baby
If this isn't love

L-o-v-e what is it to me?
L-o-v-e Oh...
If this isn't love 

So if you got real love
Let me see you put your hands up
See you put your hands up
The kind of love that fits
Tight like a glove
Let me see you put your hands up
See you put your hands up, if this isn't love
Cause I know I ain't crazy
I know I ain't trippin
I know I ain't sleeping
I know that it's love
See me with my hands up
If you think I'm dreaming
I know I ain't dreaming
Cause this reason maybe
And I know what is love
If this isn't love...
