I remember the time when I saw you
Standing there all alone in a crowd
I remember the time coz we drunk too much wine

We all join hands and we all join hands
So let's all join hands here and now

All the girls get a kiss in the ballroom
All the boys Brahms &amp; Lizst on the floor
I remember the time when we sang Auld Lang syne

We all join hands and we all join hands
So let's all join hands here and now

Have the time of your life when you're younger
And have the time of your life when you're old
Drink the wine ' feeling fine as we sang Auld Lang syne

We all join hands and we all join hands
So let's all join hands here and now
We all join hands and we all join hands
So let's all join hands here and now
Here and now 
Here and now
Here and now
