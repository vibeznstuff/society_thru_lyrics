All the leaves have turned to rust
The air is getting thin
I can see my breath
The night is rolling in

The sky is grey
It's cold as a stone
It's just the kind of day 
I can't stand to be alone

Cause you, you've been on my mind
And I wish you were here 
Beside me tonight lying in this bed 
Cause I, I'm just not the same 
I walk down these streets; I swear I hear your name 
But it's just in my head
I wish you were in my arms instead

I wasn't thinking about you 
When I thought I saw your car
I can't escape you for long
You know I never get too far 

You're everywhere I go 
Cause you're everywhere I've been
You're everything I've wanted
And I want you back again

Cause you, you've been on my mind
And I wish you were here 
Beside me tonight lying in this bed 
Cause I, I'm just not the same 
I walk down these streets; I swear I hear your name 
But it's just in my head
I wish you were in my arms instead

I have to find a way, That's just how it is
I'm stuck here in this place

Cause you, you've been on my mind
And I wish you were here 
Beside me tonight lying in this bed 
Cause I, I'm just not the same 
I walk down these streets; I swear I hear your name 
But it's just in my head
