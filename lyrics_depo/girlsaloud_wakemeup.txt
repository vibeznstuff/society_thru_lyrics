Wake me up before I drop out on you
You treat me rough to show that you care
And I just can't refuse baby
If I had a promise from you
I'd get up and out of my bed
Instead of being subdued
Wake me up before I drop out on you
The TV life is working all right
It feels so good to lose baby
If I had a promise from you
I'd get up and out of my head
Instead I'm so confused

Let's sift through the haze of the past seven days
Moet in mud
A bottle of Bud
And Monday looks divine
Let's trip through the maze
Away from everybody's games
Your vice like grip
A sugar dip
I guess I'll get in line

Was it just the margaritas or are you lookin' at me?
Without a fuss you're getting us
Ever so slightly messed up
Is it just the margaritas or are you talkin' to me?
Feels like I'm back at school
Makes me wanna break the rules

Wake me up before I drop out on you
You treat me rough to show that you care
And I just can't refuse baby
If I had a promise from you
I'd get up and out of my bed
Instead of being subdued
Wake me up before I drop out on you
The TV life is working all right
It feels so good to lose baby
If I had a promise from you
I'd get up and out of my head
Instead I'm so confused

Always feel we're fighting a war
Always thought that you were so cool
Never realised that you've been shared
I think you're off your head

Dressed up and put on my make up
My best face just for you
I'm sad to hear that you feel sugar
Now you know what I can do

Don't waste your time
(Don't waste your time)
You know my passion is to yours of mine
Just read the signs
(Just read the signs)
Your passion belongs to me
Myself and I

Wake me up before I drop out on you
You treat me rough to show that you care
And I just can't refuse baby
If I had a promise from you
I'd get up and out of my bed
Instead of being subdued
Wake me up before I drop out on you
The TV life is working all right
It feels so good to lose baby
If I had a promise from you
I'd get up and out of my head
Instead I'm so confused

(Don't waste your time)
(Don't waste your time)
(Just read the signs)
