Because I love you more
than words could ever say.
I can live again
with no regrets of dreams that died before you came.

Because I know this time
this love is really mine.
I can love again
and touch the stars that seemed so very far away.

There's a world for us to find.
Far beyond the rainbow line.
And new horizons everyday
with love to guide us all the way
eternally, eternally. 

Because you came to me
with all my dream to see.
I can give again
with no regrets for all I gave before you came.

There's a world for us to find.
Far beyond the rainbow line.
And new horizons everyday
with love to guide us all the way
eternally, eternally.

There's a world for us to find.
Far beyond the rainbow line.
And new horizons everyday
with love to guide us all the way
because there's you, because there's you.
