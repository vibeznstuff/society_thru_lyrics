Youre my past, my future,
My all, my everything,
My six in the morning when the clock rings
and i open up my eyes to a new day
My Laughs, my frowns
My ups, My downs
Its a feeling that you get when you know that somethings true,
When i think of love i think of you

Im looking at you while your sleeping here beside me,
Oh, mere words cant explain the love i have inside
Its more than just a physical thing, i know
Its something like a spiritual connection
I feel it in my soul heart and mind

The sweetest thing is what you are
From you, I'll never be to far,
Please say forever you will stay beside me

Your beautiful like the colours of the rainbow
Warm heated like the rays of the sun on summer days
All i got to do is look into your eyes to lose myself
Your the substance of my dreams, epitomy of women
The only one i truly call mine

Oohh when i think of love i think of you
Baby i love you, baby i need you.
