Oh oh oh oh oh, Whoa
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, Whoa
Oh oh oh oh oh

I've been up in the air, out of my head,
Stuck in a moment of emotion I destroyed.
Is this the end I feel?
Up in the air, fucked up on life,
&gt; All of the laws I've broken, loves that I've sacrificed.
Is this the end, end, end, end?

I'll wrap my hands around your neck so tight with love, love.

A thousand times I tempted fate.
A thousand times I played this game.
A thousand times that I have said today, today, today.

Whoa, oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh oh oh oh

I've been up in the air, lost in the night.
I wouldn't trade an eye for your lies.
Your lust for my life.
Is this the end, hey?

You were the love of my life, the darkness, the light.
This is a portrait of a tortured you and I.
Is this the, is this the, is this the end?

I'll wrap my hands around your neck so tight with love, love, love.

A thousand times I tempted fate.
A thousand times I played this game.
A thousand times that I have said,
Today, today, today.

Whoa

A thousand times I tempted fate (whoa)
A thousand times I played this game (whoa)
A thousand times that I have said (whoa),
Today, today, today.

Whoa, oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh oh oh oh

Oh (today) oh (today) oh (today) oh (today) oh (today) oh (today) oh (today)

I've been up in the air.
Is this the end I feel?
Up in the air, chasing a dream so real.
I've been up in the air.

I'll wrap my hands around your neck, neck, neck, neck (is this the end I feel?)
Up in the air, chasing a dream, chasing a dream.

Take no more!
Take no more!
Take no more!
I'll take no more!

A thousand times I tempted fate (take no more)
A thousand times I played this game (take no more)
A thousand times that I have said (take no more),
Today, today, today.

Whoa

Today, today, today, today (I'll wrap my hands around your neck, neck with love, love.)
Today, today, today, today (I'll wrap my hands around your neck, neck with love, love.)

I'll wrap my hands around your neck, neck, neck, neck, neck, neck, neck, neck.
I'll wrap my hands around your neck so tight with love, love.
