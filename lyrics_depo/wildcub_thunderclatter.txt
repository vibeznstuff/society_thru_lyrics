I see you hidden in the night I found you
I see you separate from the others
Bent crooked in the light around you
Bathing in the sight of the others

I couldn't say what I was thinking
My heart shrinking
Two sad sparks blinking in the sun
Wait one minute
I had to listen for it

It was hidden in the fall
Waiting on love to call

I met you in the dead of winter
I stood stranded in the water
Dug deeper than a crooked splinter
I turned away from all the others

I couldn't say what I was thinking
My heart shrinking
Two sad sparks blinking in the sun
Wait one minute
I had to listen for it

It was hidden in the fall
Waiting on love to call

Sad hopes I'd hidden under
Tangled inside of me
You spoke like broken thunder
Deep into the center of me

I couldn't say what I was thinking
My heart shrinking
Two sad sparks blinking in the sun
Wait one minute
I had to listen for it

It was hidden in the fall
Waiting on love to call

I hear it call in the center of it all
You're the love of my life
I feel it all in the center of my heart
You're the love of my life
