Some people always complain
That their life is too short so they hurry it along
Their worries drive them insane
But they still go along for the ride

As for me, I have all the time in the world

I was born a someday man
I'm a maybe child
I was born a someday man
I was always wild

Tomorrow's a new day, baby
Anything can happen
Anything can happen at all

Some folks are working for reasons
And waiting for answers they're never gonna find
They keep on searching for pleasures
And looking so hard they can't see

But for me, life can be a sweet holiday

I was born a someday man
I'm a maybe child
I was born a someday man
I was always wild

Tomorrow's a new day, baby
Anything can happen
Anything can happen at all

I was born a someday man
I'm a maybe child
I was born a someday man
I was always wild

I was born a someday man
I'm a maybe child
I was born a someday man
I was always wild
