Flame is burning feels so right
I'm gonna give you love tonight
You know I need your love so much
Make me shiver when we touch

I feel love for you
Close your eyes you'll feel it too
Don't go hold you back
I'm getting ready for a love attack

Close the door, turn out the light
I'm burning just like dynamite
It's time to give your love to me
Like my passion with your key

So much love inside
No way I can stand the tide
Don't go holding back
You know I'm ready for a love attack

I'm turned on and all I want is you
Don't turn me down I don't know what I'll do

I'm so full of love inside
You really make me come alive
It's time to let your feelings show
Hold me close don't let me go

I feel love for you
Close your eyes you'll feel it too
Don't go hold you back
I'm getting ready for a love attack.
