Somebody get me a hammer
Wanna break all the clocks and the mirrors
And go back to a time that was different
A time when I
Didn't feel like there was something missing
Now my body and mind are so distant
Don't know how to escape from this prison

How can I
Free my mind?

Cause I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe

I can't breathe

How can I live in the moment
When my thoughts never feel like my own and
Don't know how to admit that I'm broken

How can I
Be alright?

Cause I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe

I can't breathe

I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
