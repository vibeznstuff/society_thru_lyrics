Them man wanna send for me
Envy and jealousy, it's everything I wished upon my enemies
See me doing well and now they're telling me they're getting me
I just fly west and link Melanie
Times I was selling green
Now I've got more stones on my watch than a cemetery
Girls can remember me, F U and your memory
Jussy, what you telling me?
Come we fly to Nike, and trust me everything we're getting free
Everything we're getting free
From crack fiends and hella b
To rap beats and melodies, athletes will never see
Chat chatting 'bout us man, they'll never be us man
They'll never be

'Cause all my man are running to the money
We be running like ay, ay, ay, ay
And all my man are running from them hoes on the roads like whoa whoa whoa, whoa
Like whoa, a month ago you didn't wanna know
But now I'm seeing dough, these catties they be calling off my phone
All these mandem, they applaud me on the road

I put corn in for my bros
Mandem keep on talking on the low
Mandem keep on talking on the low
But, all my man are bros
And all my man, and all my man are bros
My mandem have your mandem on the ropes
I'll have mandem on your road
Mandem in a batch or on their own
With a bat or with a pole
I've got mandem that will slap a man with both
Nike jacket on my back, I'm looking cold
It's funny how these catties wanna know

'Cause all my man are running to the money
We be running like ay, ay, ay, ay
And all my man are running from them hoes on the roads like whoa whoa whoa, whoa
Like whoa, a month ago you didn't wanna know
But now I'm seeing dough, these catties they be calling off my phone
All these mandem, they applaud me on the road

Look, I came in late
Two bottles in my hand, I think it's looking like I'm waved
I'm searching for a brown skin girl with a body
Or a lightskin chick with a smile, good style and a pretty little face
I used to spend a grand a week, stuntin' on some hoes
But Prada boy retired, I don't rock designer clothes
I put Â£40 on my H&amp;M jeans, and the rest came free
I told my mom I'll give her everything I own
The hell you mean you haven't heard of us?
F a guest list, 20 man is how I'm turning up
Swear I saw that girl last year, she tried to curve me
Her boyfriend's in cunch cause he's broke
That's a joke, tell your man to come and work for us
Trapping's still alive, my brother I know you've heard of us
Said you gonna ride my brother but you ain't burst at us
Guys have got 5 times 5 times 5, that will send you to the sky
My brother, no you ain't hurting us
My lifestyle's exciting, imagine being the reason that two girls are fighting
Both hands swinging nonstop like a Breitling
So sorry to my brown ting from Loughton, and sorry to my white ting from Brighton
(Can I get away with saying that?)

'Cause all my man are running to the money
We be running like ay, ay, ay, ay
And all my man are running from them hoes on the roads like whoa whoa whoa, whoa
Like whoa, a month ago you didn't wanna know
But now I'm seeing dough, these catties they be calling off my phone
All these mandem, they applaud me on the road

I put corn in for my bros
Man they keep on talking on the low
Man they keep on talking on the low
But, all my man are bros
And all my man, and all my man are bros
My mandem have your mandem on the ropes
I'll have mandem on your road
Mandem in a batch or on their own
With a bat or with a pole
I've got mandem that will slap a man with both
Nike Jacket on my back, I'm looking cold
It's funny how these catties wanna know

'Cause all my man are running to the money
We be running like ay, ay, ay, ay
And all my man are running from them hoes on the roads like whoa whoa whoa, whoa
