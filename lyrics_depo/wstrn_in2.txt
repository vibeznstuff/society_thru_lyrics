I'm just in my zone

You'd be lying if you said I wasn't something that you're in2, in2 (yeah)
Don't be stuntin' in front of your friends, you know what I'm in2, in2
Don't need to hide it, you could be mine let's take it slow
Man, he's a hater, I'll let it slide, I came for you

Oh yeah, when I was in a party it was on me
I remember it all, it was last week
When I stepped in it was half three
Hennessy did spill on your Jeans (get the cleaner)
Do you remember asking me what I'm in2?
I replied "music baby, follow my Insta"
Show you what I'm in2, deep's what I'm in2
All of you two-faced friends, yeah, I've been through
You'd be lying if you said I wasn't something that you're in2
(Just tell me the truth girl)
You lying to yourself, I told you my name is Akelle
Been in and out girls, must be able to tell
I've been dying for the chance to tell you I'm into you
(Just tell me the truth girl)
Just tell me you like me (tell me you like me)
Tell me you want me, yeah, yeah!

You'd be lying if you said I wasn't something that you're in2, in2

Listen
You'd be lying if you said I wasn't something you was in2
Mama warned you about this shit too
Bet she did
Never been one for them to settle with
Cellophane, wrapping it up as soon as I get with it
Menacing, men have seen all the crud that I'm steppin' with
Celibate, what are these words? Not comprehending it
Ending it, mashing the works, that's where your belly get
Trembling, baby you ready, that's how I end 'em

You'd stuntin' in front of your friends, you know what I'm in2 (in2), in2, (in2)
Call me domino, follow it, baby girl that's what your kid do (kid do)
So won't you take a stroll with me, girl? (me girl)
No stress of piss, hold me girl
Cause I can make you scream (I can make you scream)
Just put your trust in me

You'd be lying if you said I wasn't something that you're in2, in2
Don't be stuntin' in front of your friends, you know what I'm in2, in2
Don't need to hide it, you could be mine let's take it slow
Man, he's a hater, I'll let it slide, I came for you
You'd be lying if you said I wasn't something that you're in2, in2
Don't be stuntin' in front of your friends, you know what I'm in2, in2
Don't need to hide it, you could be mine let's take it slow
Man, he's a hater, I'll let it slide, I came for you

We riding, it's time I decided
Forget all the pride and
You're in for a surprising
We riding, it's time I decided

Just leave it, leave it, leave it
