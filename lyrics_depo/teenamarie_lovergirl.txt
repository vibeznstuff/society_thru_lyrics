Shoo de Ba!

Funky Box!


Coffee, tea on me baby
Touche a la'
My opening line might be a bit passe
But don't think that I don't know I'm feeling for ya
Cause I got a vibe on you the first time that I saw you saw you


I need your love, and I won't bring no pain
A little birdie told me that you feel the same game
I'm for the real, and for you I'm true blue 
Let's make a deal sugar all I want to do is be your one and only lover


I just want to be your lovergirl ooh whoa
I just want to rock your world!
Oh yeah yeah yeah yea yea yea yea


Hook, line and sinker baby, that's how you caught me
My second verse might be a big old hat but
Don't think that I don't know what it's doing to me
Cause I got a vibe on you the first time you saw through me through me


I need your love
And I won't bring no pain
A little birdie told me that you feel the same game
I'm for the real
And for you I'm true blue 
Let's make a deal sugar
All I wanna do is be your one and only lover


I just want to be your lovergirl ooh whoa
I just want to rock your world!
Oh yea yea yea yeeeaaaaaa!
