Used to think that life was sweet
Used to think we were so complete
I can't believe you'd throw it away

Used to feel we had it made
Used to feel we could sail away
Can you imagine how I feel today
Well, it seems a long time ago
You were the lonely one
Now it comes to letting go
You are the only one
Do you know what you've done

It's so funny
How we don't talk anymore
It's so funny
Why we don't talk anymore
But I ain't losing sleep
And I ain't counting sheep
It's so funny
How we don't talk anymore

Oooooooh, we don't talk

Well, it really doesn't matter to me
I guess you're leaving was meant to be
It's down to you now
You wanna be free
Well I hope you know which way to go
You're on your own again
Don't come crying to me
When you're the lonely one
Remember what you've done

It's so funny
How we don't talk anymore
It's so funny
Why we don't talk anymore
But I ain't losing sleep
And I ain't counting sheep (sheeeeep)
No, no, no
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore

Oooooooh, we don't talk
Whoooooo, we don't talk
But I ain't no, losing sleep
No, I ain't counting sheep (sheeeeep)
No, no, no
It's so funny how we don't talk
