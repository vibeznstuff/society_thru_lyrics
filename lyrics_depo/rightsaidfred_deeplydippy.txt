Deeply dippy bout the curves you've got
Deeply hot
Hot for the curves you've got
Deeply dippy bout the fun we had
Deeply mad
Mad for the fun we had

Oh... my love
I can't make head nor tail of passion
Oh...my love
Let's set sail for the seas of passion now

Deeply dippy bout the way you walk
A contact sport
Let the neighbours talk
Deeply dippy I'm your superman
I'll explain 
You're my Lois Lane

Oh...my love
I can't make head nor tail of passion
Oh...my love
Let's set sail for the seas of passion now

(alright)

(again)
(awh yeh)
(I said)
(hey)

Deeply dippy bout your Spanish eyes
Sierra smile
Legs that go on for miles and miles

(awh see those legs man)

Miles and miles
I said oh...my love
I can't make head nor tail of passion
Oh..my love
So lets set sail for the seas of passion
Oh...my love
I can't make head nor tail of passion
Oh..my love
So let's set sail for the seas of passion

(I'm takin' a hot tahiti)
