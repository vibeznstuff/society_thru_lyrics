Would you take a bullet?
Would you bite the gun?
I fall onto my knees
And yes the war's already won

So please don't take me for no fool
Spend a lifetime in your shoes
And now I'm walking
Yes, I'm walking

Through the fire I'll keep burning on
Will I hold myself together
When it all goes wrong
The fires, they keep burning on
Will I hold myself together

When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
I'll take my time, I'll keep on holding on
When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
I'll pull myself together, keep on holding on

Gloves off, we're finished
You better hang your feets
I nurse your battle scars but you leave
My heart's a-bleed

So please don't take me for no fool
I spend a lifetime in your shoes
And now I'm walking
Now I'm walking

Through the fire I'll keep burning on
Will I hold myself together

When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
I'll take my time, I'll keep on holding on
When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
When it all goes wrong
I'll pull myself together, keep on holding on

Just like I take my faints
You keep playing the same old games
But remember
But remember, oh no

Through dark nights
We burn right
'Til the sunset
'Til the sunset
Through dark nights
We burn right
'Til the sunset
'Til the sunset
Through dark nights
We burn right
'Til the sunset
'Til the sunset
When it all goes wrong
Through dark nights (When it all goes wrong)
We burn right (When it all goes wrong)
'Til the sunset (I'll take my time)
'Til the sunset (I'll keep on holding on)
Through dark nights (When it all goes wrong)
We burn right (When it all goes wrong)
When it all goes wrong
I'll pull myself together, keep on holding on
