Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know, and it's been coming for sometime
When it's over so they say
It'll bring a sunny day
I know, shining down like water

I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day

Yesterday and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hot
I know, been that way for all my time
Till forever on it goes
Fill the circle fast and slow
I know, and I can't stop my wonder

I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day

I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day

Have you ever seen the rain...
