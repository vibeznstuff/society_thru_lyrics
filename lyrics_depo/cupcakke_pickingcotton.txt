My sister wheezing so I'm speeding down the E-way
Having a baby don't blame me for being late
Officer light so bright I hear a siren
Pull me over and it's over shots firing
Bleeding bad, tryna look at his badge
Blood bath because he decided to spaz
Aiming at my brain to put me under a grave
Cops say yo car was moving faster than a runaway slave
Than I froze, can't even stand up on my toes
Why shoot when there's a taser and a pole?
Blue and black lives matter, who knows?
Is you gone call it in? The ambulance they could have took me
It's always that one cop that try to be a rookie
This ain't right why blacks and whites can't stick together
Do whatever sorta like a duplex cookie, you fucking rookie

Beat us and treat us so rotten
Still think we slaves we just not picking cotton
Yall beat us and treat us so rotten
Still think we slaves we just not picking cotton
Yall beat us and treat us so rotten
Beat us and treat us so rotten
Beat us and treat us so rotten
Still think we slaves we just not picking cotton

They don't really want us to speak its about unity
Right now I'm rapping on a white man's beat
Cause I'm complete and comfortable with me
Every white man is not corrupted as the white men we see
I could vouch for that but some still stuck in a state of mind
Or putting us behind and making us leave out the back
Play that damn angel when they among us
But 164 years back they hung us
I'm not a slave to the white man
Or white woman standing by me
I'm not a slave to the record labels bidding how to sign me
I am not a slave I am brave video every cop that make us stop
Before our body drop and be sure to press save
We need that for proof these cops they goof
They pull you over and shoot then play it off like oops
Intimidated by our presence so he be drawing the weapon
Not screaming justice for nothing we not gone keep on failing

Beat us and treat us so rotten
Still think we slaves we just not picking cotton
Yall beat us and treat us so rotten
Still think we slaves we just not picking cotton
Yall beat us and treat us so rotten
Beat us and treat us so rotten
Beat us and treat us so rotten
Still think we slaves we just not picking cotton

Of course, there's no remorse
Upon the force, freedom of speech till I'm hoarse
You ain't gotta you ain't gotta
You ain't gotta call me a nigga
I'm dead even if I surrender
You ain't gotta call me a nigga
I'm dead even if I surrender
Oh yo, you ain't gotta call me a nigga
I'm dead even if I surrender
I said you ain't gotta call me a nigga
I'm dead even if I surrender
