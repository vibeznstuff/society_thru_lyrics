So much for the city
Tell me that you'll dance to the end
Just tell me that you'll dance to the end

Hey, hey you're the monkees
People said you monkeyed around
But nobody's listening now

Just don't go back to Big Sur
Hangin' around, lettin' your old man down
Just don't go back to Big Sur
Baby baby please don't go

So much for the street lights
They're never gonna guide you home
No they're never gonna guide you home

Down at the steam boat show,
All the kids start spittin'
I guess it didn't live up to the billing.

Just don't go back to Big Sur
Hangin' around, lettin' your old man down
Just don't go back to Big Sur
Baby baby please don't go
