I don't want to 
Go on without you
It's so bad to be alone
Whoa, baby come home

I need you, yes I do now
I will be so blue
I couldn't see your face
your face
oh...it's in this place

Here in the gloom
Of my lonely room
I hold her handkerchief 
And smell her sweet perfume

I can't stand it
Leave home without you
O my Darlin' hear my plea
Come on back to me

Here in the gloom
In my lonely room
I hold her handkerchief 
And smell her sweet perfume

I can't stand it
Leave home without you
Oh my darlin, hear my plea
Come on back to me
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
Leave home without you

Don't you go now
Don't you go now
Don't you go now

I will be so blue
I don't want to go on without you
