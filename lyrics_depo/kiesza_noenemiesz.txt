Don't stop me just give me more
You're what I want for sure
Don't stop I just want you more
Babe you're my only cure
Do something to make you mine
You could take all my time
Don't stop I feel so alive
Baby you blow my mind

Why stop when there's so much more
Baby just show me how to
Look, I'll give you so much more
Or do you have it lining
You've never felt this before
Baby I know you want it
Everybody knows-body knows-body knows-body

If we could all fall in love together
If we could all fall in love together
If we could all fall in love together
We'd have no enemies, we'd have no enemies
If we could all fall in love together
If we could all fall in love together
If we could all fall in love together
We'd have no enemies, we'd have no enemies
Ah-ooh, Ah-ooh, Ah-ooh

Lights up, let me take you down
That's what I want right now
Freestyling make me go wild
Baby just turn me around
All that I can save for you
Show me what you can do
Don't stop me I can't refuse
Take me the whole way through

If we could all fall in love together
If we could all fall in love together
If we could all fall in love together
We'd have no enemies, we'd have no enemies
If we could all fall in love together
If we could all fall in love together
If we could all fall in love together
We'd have no enemies, we'd have no enemies
Ah-ooh, Ah-ooh, Ah-ooh
