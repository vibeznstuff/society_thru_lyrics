Ladies you're damn right 
You can't read a man's mind 
We're living in two tribes 
And heading for war
Nobody's perfect 
We all gotta work it 
But fellas, we're worth it 
So don't break the law

Your call's late, big mistake 
You've gotta hang about in limbo for as long as I take 
Next time, read my mind and I'll be good to you 
We're gift-wrapped kitty cats
We're only turning into tigers when we gotta fight back 
Let's go, Eskimo 
Out into the blue 

Come take my hand
Understand that you can 
You're my man and I need you tonight
Come make my dreams
Honey hard as it seems 
Loving me is as easy as pie, I

I'm just a love machine 
Feeding my fantasy 
Give me a kiss or three 
And I'm fine 
I need a squeeze a day 
Instead of this negligee 
What will the neighbours say 
This time 

I've been going crazy while you sleep 
Searching for a language
That the two of us can speak so
Mr. prehistoric, make your wheel 
And I'll breathe underwater '
'Cos I like the way it feels 

Your call's late, big mistake 
You've gotta hang about in limbo for as long as I take 
Next time, read my mind and I'll be good to you 
We're gift-wrapped kitty cats
We're only turning into tigers when we gotta fight back 
Let's go, Eskimo 
Out into the blue 

Come take my hand
Understand that you can 
You're my man and I need you tonight
Come make my dreams
Honey hard as it seems 
Loving me is as easy as pie, I

I'm just a love machine 
Feeding my fantasy 
Give me a kiss or three 
And I'm fine 
I need a squeeze a day 
Instead of this negligee 
What will the neighbours say 
This time 

Oh, it's very new 
Can anybody tell me what to do? 
Oh, this feeling's very strange 
Can anybody tell me what's you're game? 

(Oh) A little education 
(Oh) To give you motivation 
(Oh) We'll turn the situation 
(Oh) 'Cos I don't wanna change ya
(Oh) Making you a stranger 
(Oh) I'll only re-arrange ya... for now

(Oh) I'm just a Love Machine 
(0h) To give you motivation 
(Oh) I'm just a Love Machine 
(Ooh, ooh)
(Oh) I'm just a Love Machine 
(0h) To give you motivation 
(Oh) I'm just a Love Machine 
(Oh, oh, oh)
