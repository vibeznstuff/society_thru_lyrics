You've been talking in your sleep again.
About the way you've been pulling
my heart strings
When I think I'm on my feet again I
fall down, I fall down

At Frothy Seven Park Avenue
Loud is the singing down in the bar
room so lonely,
I wish I was in paradise

The broken lover in me, girl
Has been fixed in my memory
Lay your love, lay your love on me


I lost a little love in this way
I find it in my heart to say
Gonna shed a tear for you today
For love, love I gave away, I gave away

You've been making those eyes
again
Down in the city and up in your
ivory tower
One day soon you're gonna reach
out and call my name

The broken lover in me girl
Has been fixed in my memory
Lay your love, lay your love on me



Love's got me down on my knees
again
There's no easy, no easy way out
There's no easy way out
