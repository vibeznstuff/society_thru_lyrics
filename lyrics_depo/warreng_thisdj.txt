It's kind of easy when you're listening to the G-Dub sound
Pioneer speakers bumpin as I smoke on a pound
I got the sound fo yo' ass and it's easy to see
 That this D.J. be Warren G



Can I get in where I fit in?  Sit in, listen (uh-huh)
Let me conversate better yet Regulate
Shake the spot with my knot, may fade
Cause I don't like to dream about gettin paid
I played ball through the halls, of C-I-S
with Snoop Dogg's big brother, call him Dirty Left
Rack em up crack em up stack em up against the gate
The homies tryin ta catch me but they cain't, wait
Damn, the street lights just came on!
And my momma's in the streets tellin me to come home
I hit the gate and I hops on my Schwinn
And I tell the homies, "Aight then," yeah





Verse two, (uh-huh), now what the fuck I do?
Catch the bus to Cal State, or chill with the Voltron crew
and make a few ends on the side
Here comes a baby blue van, time to ride
So I hops in the van with my nigga Tick
And Baby Poppa back then, that was my click
We groovin to Santa Anna
and we plan-on, makin hellafied mount of money (hell yeah)
And what I did for extra fees
was break niggaz after work playin get like me
I was fourteen years old, havin a sack
Just a young motherfucker eatin ValuPaks
Shootin dice in the corners of the public schools
And I used to gangbang, but now it's a G Thang
And I still know how to make those ends
You don't believe me, go ask the Twinz motherfucker





Yeah, check dis out, this is I'm O.G.L.B.
knowhatI'msayin?  I'm on my little O.G. Warren G
and he just droppin this to let you BG's know
what's happen, y'all got to recognize
cause this is y'know a Long Beach thang
21st Street, but check this out

And handle that shit y'now?  Yeah
