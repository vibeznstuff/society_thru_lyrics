Who can see beyond tonight
I don't know what's wrong or right
But when I say I love you
I'm shooting from the heart

Wish I knew a better way
I hate to use an old cliche
But when I say I love you
I'm shooting from the heart

I'm just a man of simple words
Living tonight for all it's worth

All I've got is honesty
Touching you is touching me and
When I say I love you
I'm shooting from the heart
Yeah when I say I love you
I'm shooting from the heart

I'm just a man of simple words
Living tonight for all it's worth

I'm just a man of simple words
Living tonight for all it's worth

All these feelings coming out
The only thing I'm sure about
Is when I say I love you
I'm shooting from the heart
When I say I love you
I'm shooting from the heart

When I say I love you
I'm shooting from the heart...
