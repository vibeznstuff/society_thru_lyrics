Girl you single tonight
With some shit you ain't like
Bout that nigga that was lovin' on you just the other night
You've been workin' all week
Know it's hard on your feet
Let me take some of that stress up off you, come lay with me

You know wassup, pour another cup
Let that liquor hold your sentence, why you gotta talk so much?
Not tryna fuss, but I'm in a rush
See you movin' them lips but not on this so you ain't saying much
Tried to be polite, but you ain't acting right
Sit yo pretty ass on this bed, make a v-shape with your legs
That's it, that's it

I just wanna get fucked up
With you, with you, (oh yeah), with you
I just wanna get fucked up
With you, with you, (oh yeah), I do
I just wanna get fucked up
Already, already, already know
I just wanna get fucked up
Already, already, already know
I just wanna get fucked up

I admit it, I admit it
When I said I came to kick it
Girl I was lyin' (lyin')
I got so damn carried away
There's nothin' left that I can say
I want you now, I need you now
I gotta hit that shit somehow, somehow
I gotta hit that shit somehow, right now

I just wanna get fucked up
With you, with you, (oh yeah), with you
I just wanna get fucked up
With you, with you, (oh yeah), I do
I just wanna get fucked up
Already, already, already know
I just wanna get fucked up
Already, already, already know
I just wanna get fucked up
