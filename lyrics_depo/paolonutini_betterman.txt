She makes me smile
She thinks the way I think
That girl makes me wanna be better

Took her down Bleecker Street
Saw she drank the way I drink
I kissed the sky to send her blue a letter

That girl makes me wanna be a better man
Yeah, and should she see fit
Gonna treat her like a real man can

She's fearless, she's free
She is a real live wire
And that girl, she's got me feeling so much better

Oh you trade all the money in the world
Just to see this girl's smile
All the while, she'll make you feel so much better

Oh that girl makes me wanna be a better man
Yeah, and should she see fit,
Gonna treat her like a real man can

Ah, ah, la la la
Come on in my arms
You make me feel alright
You make me feel alright

You know I might get eager
I might lose my cool
Feel like I'm in detention in the office at the school

And you'll either love me or you hate me
'Cause I can see you've got no time for the in-between
But the reflection in your eyes gonna look so much better

I said that girl makes me wanna be a better man
Yeah yeah yeah
And should she see fit,
Gonna treat her like a real man can
Gonna treat her like a real man can
Gonna treat her like a real man can
Gonna treat her like a real man can
