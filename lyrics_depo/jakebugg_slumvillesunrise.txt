The wind keeps beating on my window. I haven't slept all night.
That drum just keeps on banging.
They must be buzzin' out their minds
Like bees in a hive
Tell me when the morning arrives.

This place is just not for me
I say it all the time.
My friends they just ignore me.
Tell me nevermind,
Waiting all your life for the Slumville Sunrise.

Slumville Sunrise.
Nobody cares or looks twice.
Shout away in the morning across this place where I was born in.
Every bruise, every flower illuminated by the dawning.

My face upon the concrete,
The dirt is in my mouth.
I clench my fist and feet.
I'm tryna cry out loud.
Make a sound, something is keeping me down.

This place is just not for me
I say it a thousand times
My friends they just ignore me.
Tell me nevermind
Waiting all your life for the Slumville Sunrise.

Slumville Sunrise
Nobody cares or looks twice.
Shout away in the morning across this place where I was born in.
Every bruise, every flower illuminated by the dawning.
