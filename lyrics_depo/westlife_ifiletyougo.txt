Day after day
Time passed away 
And I just can't get you off my mind 
Nobody knows, I hide it inside 
I keep on searching but I can't find 


The courage to show to letting you know
I've never felt so much love before 


And once again I'm thinking about 
Taking the easy way out 


But if I let you go I will never know 
What my life would be holding you close to me 
Will I ever see you smiling back at me? ( oh yeah) 
How will I know
 if I let you go? 


Night after night I hear myself say 
Why can't this feeling just fade away 
There's no one like you (no one like you) 
You speak to my heart (speak to my heart) 
It's such a shame we're worlds apart 


I'm too shy to ask, I'm too proud to lose 
But sooner or later I gotta choose 
And once again I'm thinking about 
Taking the easy way out 


But if I let you go I will never know 
What my life would be, holding you close to me 
Will I ever see you smiling back at me? (oh yeah) 
How will I know
 if I let you go ? 


If I let you go ooooh baby 
Ooooooooohhhhh 


Once again I'm thinking about 
Taking the easy way out 
Ooooooooohhhhh 


But if I let you go I will never know 
What my life would be, holding you close to me
( close to me)
Will I ever see you smiling back at me?
( oh yeah) 
How will I know
( if I let you go?) 
But if I let you go I will never know 
( oh baby) 
Will I ever see you smiling back at me?
( oh yeah) 
How will I know
 if I let you go ?
