Wake up kids
We've got the dreamer's disease
Age 14
We got you down on your knees
So polite,
We're busy still saying please

Frienemies,
Who when you're down ain't your friend
Every night
We smash their Mercedes-Benz
First we run
And then we laugh 'til we cry


But when the night is falling
You cannot find the light, light
You feel your dreams are dying
Hold tight


You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget
We only get what we give

I'm comin' home baby
You're tops, give it to me now

Four A.M. we ran a miracle mile
We're flat broke but hey we do it in style
The bad rich
God's flying in for your trial


But when the night is falling
You cannot find your friend (friend)
You feel your tree is breaking
Just bend



This whole damn world can fall apart
You'll be OK, follow your heart
You're in harm's way, I'm right behind
Now say you're mine




Don't let go
I feel the music in you
Fly high
What's real can't die
You only get what you give
You're gonna get what you give
(don't give up)
Just don't be afraid to live

Health insurance rip off lying
FDA big bankers buying
Fake computer crashes dining
Cloning while they're multiplying
Fashion shoots with Beck and Hanson,
Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson
You're all fakes
Run to your mansions
Come around
We'll kick your ass in!

Don't let go
One dance left


Championed by a soulless media misleading
People unaware they're bleeding
No one with a brain is believing
It's so sad you lost the meaning
Never knew it anyway
Human natures so predictable
I'm a fool to do your dirty work whoa, whoa
