
All the things I felt and never shared.
All the times she was lonely with me there.
Tears I wouldn't let fall from my eyes, and how I let her go without a fight.


The reasons Im alone I know by heart, but I dont wanna spend forever in the dark.
I swear next time Ill hang on for dear life. If love ever gives me another try.


Theres no changin things that we regret, 
the best that we can hope for is one more chance.
If the hands of time could just move in reverse, I wouldn't make the same mistake again with her


The reasons Im alone I know by heart, but I dont wanna spend forever in the dark.
I swear next time Ill hang on for dear life. If love ever gives me another try.
