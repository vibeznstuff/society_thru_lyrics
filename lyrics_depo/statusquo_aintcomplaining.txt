There's nothing left, there's nothing right
There's nothing left, right, left, right, up, down, up, down, up, down

You wind me up, you bring me down
Your reputation is all over the town
So long as you come home to me
I ain't complaining
You fool around, we scream and fight
The way you're treating me you know it ain't right
But when you're making out with me
I ain't complaining

It ain't no use playing it loose
And thinking it don't matter to me
It ain't fair at all, you only have to call my name
And I'll come running to you

You're out all night, you sleep all day
When I get home you're going out to play
Oh woman give me some time, and everything's fine
I ain't complaining
You just don't care we're in a mess
And the company you keep ain't the best
But when you're lying there with me
I ain't complaining

It ain't no use playing it loose
And thinking it don't matter to me
It ain't fair at all, you only have to call my name
And I'll come running to you
But when the chips are down
A man can only take so much foolin' around
And if you don't come home to me
I'll be complaining

There's nothing left, there's nothing right
Our situation ain't looking too bright
'Cos I've taken all I'm gonna take
Without complaining

It ain't no use playing it loose
And thinking it don't matter to me
It ain't fair at all, you only have to call my name
And I'll come running to you
But when the chips are down
A man can only take so much foolin' around
And if you don't come home to me
I'll be complaining
