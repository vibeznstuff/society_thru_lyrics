(Bring You down)
I feel alone (Feel alone)
Someone takes my picture
But never looks at me
In the eyes

You don't see me laughing
You don't
But I'll still be here waiting for you

I feel alive
You were my ecstacy
It's you that I'm craving
I feel alive
You were my energy 
So why do you hate me?

(oh Bring you down)

I feel at home (feel at home)
Someone takes my feelings (takes my feelings)
Throws them all away

You don't see me laughing
You don't
But I'll still be here waiting for you

I feel alive
You were my ecstacy it's you that I'm craving
(Bring you down)
I feel alive 
You were my energy so why do you hate me?
(Bring you down)

Leave and take me with you (with you)
Take me
But I'll still be chasing you
Fast

(yeah)
Chasing!
Faster!
(yeah)

Leave and take me with you
Take me
But I'll still be chasing you

I feel alive 
You were my ecstacy it's you that I'm craving
I feel alive
You were my energy so why do you hate me

I hold you close
Holding you close to me
You are my angel

I've lost control
You were my enemy
But now your my friend
