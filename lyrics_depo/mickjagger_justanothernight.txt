Give me just another night, just another night with you
Give me just another kiss, just before the dawn breaks through
'Cause I'm homesick, feel a little down and blue
And I'm hurting, hurting baby just like you

I was lonely 'til I saw you at the station
And I never thought you'd keep our rendezvous
Baby it's true.

Give me just another night, just another night with you
Give me just another kiss, just before the dawn breaks through
'Cause I'm hungry, hungry for your loving baby
And I'm thirsty, thirsty for your loving baby

And a one-day pass to heaven is so hard to find
And a one-night pass ain't really what I had in mind
I need your sweet tenderness, I need your soft caress
I know the day is coming, don't take away your loving
Can't you see that I'm human?

Just because you've seen my face, just because you know my name
I'm a stranger in this town, can't I have my ups and downs?
Can't you see that I'm human?

I get hungry, get thirsty
I get moody, I need attention
I need your love
I need your love
I want your love

Give me just another night, just another night with you
'Cause I'm freezing in this hundred-dollar hotel room
Don't make me leave you. No, don't you be so cruel
