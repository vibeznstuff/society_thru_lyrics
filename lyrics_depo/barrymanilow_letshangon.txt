There ain't no good in our goodbyein'
True love takes a lot of tryin'
Ohh, I'm cryin'


Let's hang on
To what we've got
Don't let go girl
We got a lot
Got a lotta love between us
Hang on
Hang on
Hang on

To what we got
You say you're gonna go and call it quits
Gonna check it all and break
Our love to bits
Break it up
(I wish you'd never said it)
Break it up
(Oh, no we'll both regret it)
That little chip of diamond on your hand
Ain't a fortune baby but you know it stands
For the love
(a love to tie and bind ya)
Such a love
(we both can't leave behind us)

Baby
(don't you go)
Baby
(don't you go)
Think it over and stay



There isn't anything I wouldn't do
I'd pay any price to get in good with you
Patch it up
(give me a second turnin')
Patch it up
(don't cool off while I'm burning)
You've got me cryin' dyin' at your door
Don't shut me out
Ooh let me in once more
Open up
(your arms I need to hold you)
Open up
(your heart, oh girl I love you)
Baby
(don't you know)
Baby
(don't you go)
Think it over and stay
