Taking a ride to another climb
Knees in my back 'cause we're flying high
Did I give it all? I guess I gave it all
Seeing the mountains through the fog
Watching a film with a talking dog
'Cause if I fall then I guess I fall

Hawaiian air, Hawaiian air
Hawaiian air, Hawaiian air

Leaving the world down beneath the clouds
Hawaiian notes, don't need no pounds
Did I give them all? Oh, did I give them all?
Ache in my leg from a broken seat
Skipping the meal for a G&amp;T
'Cause if I fall I'm beggin' not to fall

Hawaiian air, Hawaiian air
Hawaiian air, Hawaiian air

Touchin' down, hit the ground
I'm breathing new air
Gonna take this all in
Gonna take this all in

As we land you pinch my hand
I'm still here
Gonna take this all in
Gonna take this all in

Up in the sky Honolulu bound
Steel guitar and the Melly sound
Did I give it all? I guess I gave it all
Feeling the shapes keeps me reticent
Stuck in my seat from the turbulence
And if I fall then I fall

Breaking open skies of green earths
How long it floats
Deserts in our eyes, we're falling
Our hearts in our throats

Hawaiian air, Hawaiian air
Hawaiian air, Hawaiian air

Touchin' down, hit the ground
I'm breathing new air
Gonna take this all in
Gonna take this all in

As we land you pinch my hand
I'm still here
Gonna take this all in
Gonna take this all in

As the wheels hit the ground
I'm breathing Hawaiian air
Gonna take this all in
Gonna take this all in

As the heat fills my lungs
I'm breathing Hawaiian air
Gonna take this all in
Gonna take this all in

Hawaiian air, Hawaiian air
Hawaiian air, Hawaiian air
