I'm right on target, my aim is straight
So you're in love, I say what of it?
Things can change, there's always changes
I wanna try some rearranging, I say

Drop the pilot, try my balloon
Drop the monkey, smell my perfume
Drop the mahout, I'm the easy rider
Don't use your army to fight a losing battle
Animal, mineral, physical, spiritual
I'm the one you need, I'm the one you need

You're kissing cousins, there's no smoke, no flame
If you lose that pilot I can fly your plane
If you want solid ground, come on and try me
Oh I can take you so high that you're never gonna wanna come down, I say

Drop the pilot, try my balloon
Drop the monkey, smell my perfume
Drop the mahout, I'm the easy rider
Don't use your army to fight a losing battle
Animal, mineral, physical, spiritual
I'm the one you need, I'm the one you need

I said animal, mineral, physical, spiritual
I'm the one you need, I'm the one you need
I'm the one you need

Drop the pilot, try my balloon
Drop the monkey, smell my perfume
Drop the mahout, I'm an easy rider
Don't use your army to fight a losing battle

Drop the pilot, try my balloon
Drop the monkey, smell my perfume
Drop the mahout, I'm the easy rider
Don't use your army to fight a losing battle

Animal, mineral, physical, spiritual
I'm the one you need, I'm the one you need

I say drop the pilot
Drop the monkey
Drop the mahout
Animal, mineral, physical, spiritual
I'm the one you need, I'm the one you need
I'm the one you need

Drop the pilot
Drop the pilot
Drop the pilot
