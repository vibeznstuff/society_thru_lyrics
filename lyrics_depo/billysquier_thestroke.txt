Now everybody
Have you heard
If you're in the game
Then the stroke's the word
Don't take no rhythm
Don't take no style
Gotta thirst for killin'
Grab your vial and 

Put your right hand out
Give a firm handshake
Talk to me about that one big break
Spread your Ear Pollution
Both far and wide
Keep your contributions
By your side and 

Stroke me, stroke me
Could be a winner boy you move mighty well
Stroke me, stroke me
(Stroke)
Stroke me, stroke me
You got your number down
Stroke me, stroke me
Say you're a winner but man
You're just a sinner now

Put your left foot out
Keep it all in place
Work your way
Right into my face
First you try to bet me
You make my backbone slide
When you find you've bent me
Slip on by and

Stroke me, stroke me
Give me the reason this is all night long
Stroke me, stroke me
(Stroke)
Stroke me, stroke me
Get yourself together boy
Stroke me, stroke me
Say you're a winner but man
You're just a sinner now
(Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke)

Better listen now
Said it ain't no joke
Don't let your conscience fail ya'
Just do the stroke
Don't ya' take no chances
Keep your eye on top
Do your fancy dances
You can't stop you just

Stroke me, stroke me
(Stroke, stroke)
Stroke me, stroke me
(Stroke, stroke)
Stroke me, stroke me
(Stroke, stroke)
Stroke me, stroke me
(Stroke)
Stroke me, stroke me
(Stroke)
Stroke me, stroke me
(Stroke)
Stroke me, stroke me
(Stroke)
Stroke me, stroke me
Say you're a winner but man
You're just a sinner now
