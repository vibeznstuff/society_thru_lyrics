Well you started out wanting my body
And I didn't mind
'Cos we liked each other
And it also helped to pass the time

Well everybody dreams of one
And now I want you
And not just for fun
But if you've got no love to give
Baby don't give it here

I wanted you to be my lover
I would be your friend
And I'd wear the purple shirt
'Cos it makes you laugh
And I would too 

Well if there's anything I can do
I wanna do it
And if I had no love to give
I wouldn't give it to you

Your best friend's friend told someone
I was the hurting kind
And they've planted that seed
And it's growing there in your mind

Well if you're looking for a permanent mate
Just accept me as your fate
'Cos if I had no love to give
I wouldn't give it to you
