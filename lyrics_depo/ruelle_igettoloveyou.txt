One look at you; my whole life falls in line. 
I prayed for you; before I called you mine.
I can’t believe it’s true, sometimes.
I can’t believe it’s true.

I get to love you, it’s the best thing that I’ll ever do.
I get to love you, it’s a promise I’m making to you.
Whatever may come; your heart I will choose.
Forever I’m yours, forever I do.
I get to love you, I get to love you.

The way you love, it changes who I am.
I am undone and I thank God once again.
I can’t believe it’s true, sometimes.
I can’t believe it’s true.

I get to love you, it’s the best thing that I’ll ever do.
I get to love you, it’s a promise I’m making to you.
Whatever may come; your heart I will choose.
Forever I’m yours, forever I do.
I get to love you, I get to love you.
I get to love you, I get to love you.

They say love is a journey, I promise that I’ll never leave.
When it’s too heavy to carry, remember this moment with me.
I get to love you, I get to love you,
I get to love you.
