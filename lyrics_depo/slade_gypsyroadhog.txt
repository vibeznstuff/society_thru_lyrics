I powdered my nose in Alabama - Out on a limb 
Powdered my nose in Indiana - Ain't that a sin 
I had to get my butt out quick 
It always works - the old, old trick 
I got away just in the nick of time, that's why 

I powdered my nose in Oklahoma - Over the top 
I wasted away in New Orleans - I couldn't stop 
Down in the alley - happy dust 
Me and Romona we was gettin' bust 
I got away just in the nick of time, that's why 

I got the nickname the Gypsy Roadhog 
On the California trail 
I gotta keep my wheels movin' on 
I gotta keep me outa jail 

Powdered my nose in San Francisco down on the bay 
It went to my head down in New York City 
I was blasted away 
And two ugly scuts bust in the room 
They took away my little silver spoon 
I got away just in the nick of time, that's why 



I'm comin' through, through, through 
I'm looking for you
