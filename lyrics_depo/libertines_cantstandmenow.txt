An ending fitting for the start
you twist and tore our love apart
your light fingers through the dark
that shattered the lamp and into the darkness cast us...

No you've got it the wrong way round
you shut me up and blamed it on the brown
cornered the boy kicked out at the world...the world kicked back
alot fuckin' harder now

If you wanna try, If you wanna try
there's no worse you could do (oh  oh oh)
I know you lie (I know you lie)
I'm still in love with you (oh oh oh)

Can't take me anywhere (Cant take you anywhere)
Can't take me anywhere (wouldn't take you anyway)
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go

by YOU CAN'T STAND ME NOW YOU CAN'T STAND ME NOW CAN'T STAND ME NOW
CAN'T STAND ME NOW

Have we enough to keep it together?
or do we just keep on pretending (and hope our luck is never ending..)
You tried to pull the wool I wasn't feeling too clever,
you tool all that they're lending
until you needed mending...

If you wanna try...etc

YOU CAN'T STAND ME NOW
