In the morning light
Half awake and half asleep
Have you ever lay there thinking
Was it all in a dream
But you reach out and she's there
Every moment everywhere
Have you ever been in love
Have you ever felt how far a heart can fall
Have you ever stayed up waiting for a telephone call
Just to hear her say hello
'Cos you miss each other so
Have you ever been in love
Have there been times to laugh
And times you really wanna cry
Finding reasons to believe her
'Cos you'd die a little if she lied
And when in times of doubt
Have you ever tried to work it out
But still she leaves you wondering what it's all about
When she's far away, did you ever felt the need to stray
And tried and then discovered it just doesn't pay
And with her you can be true
For with her you can be you
Have you ever been in love
Have there been times to laugh
And times you really wanna cry
Finding reasons to believe her
'Cos you'd die a little if she lied
And when in times of doubt
Have you ever tried to work it out
But still she leaves you wondering what it's all about



And when in times of doubt
Have you ever tried to work it out
And still she leaves you wondering what it's all about
And when the night comes down
Can you call this house a home
Do you dream you're still together
And wake up alone
Have you ever been in love
The way that I'm in love
Have you ever been in love
