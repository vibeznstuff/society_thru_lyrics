Mr. Telephone man
There's something wrong with my line,
When I dial my baby's number
I get a click every time
Mr. Telephone Man
There's something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby's number
I get a click every time

When I dial 611 Computer Service
She said "Hello. May I help you, please?"
I told her something must be wrong with my phone
'Cause my baby wouldn't hang up on me

Mr. Telephone Man
There's something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby's number
I get a click every time
Mr. Telephone Man
There's something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby's number
I get a click every time

She let the phone ring 20 times before she answered
Let me tell you what happened then
A minute later
I got the operator
Saying, "Please hang up and place your call again."

There's something wrong with my line

Mr. Telephone Man,
Something's wrong with my line
I try to dial her number
I get a click every time

Some strange man is on the telephone
He keeps telling me my baby ain't home
She got no party line
The situation's blowing my mind
Oh, I just can't take this anymore

Please operator
See what you can do,
I dialed the right number
But I still couldn't get through
Could you just check the line
Just one more time if you can?
I'm pretty sure her phone
Wouldn't be answered by no man

I give her my love and affection
I just can't take this no more
This situation's blowing my mind
Blowing my mind
Can't get my baby on the line

I tried dialing information 
Mr. Telephone Man
I can't get no cooperation 
Mr. Telephone Man
Her sister's on the phone
Telling me my baby ain't at home
Come on, baby, I just can't take it no more

Help me out
Please Mr. Telephone Man
Help me out
Please Mr. Telephone Man
