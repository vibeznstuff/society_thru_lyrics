What do you wanna make those eyes at me for
If they don't mean what they say
Ooh, they make me glad, they make me sad
They make me want a lot of things that I never had
You're fooling around with me now
Oh, you lead me on and then you run away

Oh, that's alright
I'll get you a lonesome night
And baby you'll find you're messing with dynamite
So what do you wanna make those eyes at me for
If they don't mean what they say

What do you wanna make those eyes at me for
If they don't mean what they say
Ooh, they make me glad, they make me sad
They make me want a lot of things that I never had
You're fooling around with me now
Oh, you lead me on and then you run away

Oh, that's alright
I'll get you a lonesome night
And baby you'll find you're messing with dynamite
So what do you wanna make those eyes at me for
If they don't mean what they say

What do you wanna make those eyes at me for

Oh, that's alright
I'll get you a lonesome night
And baby you'll find you're messing with dynamite
So what do you wanna make those eyes at me for
If they don't mean what they say

If they don't mean what they say
If they don't mean what they say, yeah!
