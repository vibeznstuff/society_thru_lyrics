Honey, I work so hard for my money
And I leave my babies at home
Breaking my back trying to bring home a check
And working my fingers to the bone
At the end of the day it feels like a game
One I was born to lose
This institution a dead revolution
Is giving young women abuse

Pay gap, pay gap
Why don't you do the math?
Pay gap, pay gap
Ripping my dollars in half

It's not that I'm asking for more than I'm owed
And I don't think I'm better than you
You say that we live in the land of the free
Well, sometimes that bell don't ring true
It's been that way, with no equal pay
And I want to know when it will be fixed
Women do work and get treated like slaves since 1776

Pay gap, pay gap
Don't give me that feminism crap
Pay gap, pay gap
Ripping my dollars in half

No matter your religion, no matter your race
No matter your orientation
No matter your creed and no matter your taste
No matter your denomination
We are all the same in the eyes of God
But in the eyes of rich white men
No more than a maid to be owned like a dog
A second-class citizen

Pay gap, pay gap
Why don't you do the math?
Pay gap, pay gap
Ripping my dollars in half
