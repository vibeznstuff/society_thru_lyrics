You know me make examples
We're history's booth
This is a future cut


Yeah
I gotta good heart
I born on beat that's a good start
I had a feeling I'll pass push pass
So now I feel like I'm the reason I should last
I move like my ish don't stink
Gotta em all in a trance no hypnosis
This is all from the heart impro no script (yeah)
I'm just about writing it down
So now I don't sleep man I miss those nights
Take planes like trains I don't miss no flights
I'm the type of guy that would have no life
Just so I could shine like disco lights
And I sound sad but I'm happy
And the only plans to stay scatty
Unorthodox I make the bar so I call the shots


We don't follow no crowd
They follow us
Don't follow no sound
It follows us
Don't sit in hell
Look down that wishing well
Unorthodox we call our own shots


Yeah
I gotta good vibe
I ain't trying to be bait with my hook lines
I had a feeling could fly
Before I hopped on a plane or I knew sky
Yeah
I'm a good guy and if you heard otherwise its a true lie
I'm hype I don't do shy
I bark up every tree and I do bite (hahaha)
Yeah
I'm only playing
We all got freedom of speech
I'm only saying
I ain't got time for beef I'm on the way in
So the 8th day of the weeks my only lay in
And I sound sad but I'm happy
And the only plans to stay scatty
Unorthodox I make the bar so I call the shots


We don't follow no crowd
They follow us
Don't follow no sound
It follows us
Don't sit in hell
Look down that wishing well
Unorthodox we call our own shots


No one can hold us down again
No one will touch our crown again
No one can hold us down again (no way)
No one will touch our crown again


We don't follow no crowd (no way)
They follow us
Don't follow no sound
It follows us
Don't sit in hell
Look down that wishing well
Unorthodox we call our own shots
We don't follow no crowd
They follow us
Don't follow no sound
It follows us
Don't sit in hell
Look down that wishing well
Unorthodox we call our own shots
No one can hold us down again
No one will touch our crown again
No one can hold us down again (no way)
No one will touch our crown again
