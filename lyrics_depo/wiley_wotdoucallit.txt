Tell us wot you call it

Garage I don't care about garage
Listen to this, it don't sound like garage
Who told you that I make garage?
Wiley Kat'z got his own style s'not garage

Make it in the studio but not in the garage
Here in London there's a sound called garage
But this is my sound, it sure ain't garage
I heard they don't like me in garage

'Cause I use their scene but make my own sound
The Eskimo sound is mine recognize this
It's mine, you can't claim what's mine
It's my time to bait you up

I don't hate you but some of you have got a problem
I'm puttin' you outta business why is that a problem
Wot's your problem?
Wot the heck my name is problem, remember

Wot do you call it garage?
(Wot do you call it garage?)
Wot do you call it urban?
(Wot do you call it urban?)

Wot do you call it 2step?
(Wot do you call it 2step?)
Wot do you call it, tell us what you call it then

Why do that think I'm stupid
I got brains, I could never be stupid
You could never use my name to make your raves 'n' jam
I won't turn up, I'll stay at home with my gyal 'n' jam

Can't threaten me with that bad man talk
I'm not scared sorry man
I've seen too much I don't give a monkeys
Swing from tree to tree just like monkeys

Who influenced me to be funky
Who influenced me to make Eski beat
I've made Eski gyals 'n' Eski boys
Movin' there feet to the sound you can hear

You can hear I hear you tryin' to stop my record sales
Record deals like the belt can't hold the waist in
(The waist in)
If it gets too big and it's tremblin' those pots
It blows up and we win
(I'm winnin')

Ready to say my goodbyes
Goodbye to the man who don't like me
Goodbye to the woman who don't like me
Goodbye to the fingers pointin' at me

Goodbye to the promoters that hate me
Goodbye to the people that's hasslin' me
I'm turnin' over a new leaf
Get sharp like a knife in the sheet

If you don't cut the strings it's more beef
See I get the impression I'm not wanted
So I'm givin' you the sound that's not wanted
I'm on my way now

Wish me luck, I'm doin' my thing now
To the bikes let's go everyone who likes this let's go
Everyone who likes that go that way
Go that way, go that way, go that way
Go that way, go that way, go that way

Everyone who likes this come this way
(Come this way)
Let's go this way, let's go this way
Let's go this way, let's go this way
Let's go this way

I'll break everybody down
Take everybody down, any crew any sound
Any MC who's in my way I break down
I'm a show you now it's all changed round

I remember when things were the other way round
When the world got colder and it changed round
I go to every manor and it's all changed round
I want everybody to follow this sound

So don't deny the power of my empire
When I'm hit a strike back with empire
No more crew so we got an empire
Roll Deep empire high flyer high power

I'm a compulsory re-buyer
Go to the shops and I spend them buy what I want
And this is for Roll deep empire
If you work hard then you can be a buyer, like me
