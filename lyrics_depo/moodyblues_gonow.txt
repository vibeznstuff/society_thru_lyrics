We've already said ‘Goodbye’.
Since you've got to go
Oh you had better go now.
Go now. Go now. Go now
Before you see me cry.
I don't want you to tell me
Just what you intend to do now.
'Cause how many times do I have to tell you
Darling, darling,
I'm still in love
With you now?

We've already said ‘So long’
I don't want to see you go.
Oh you had better go now.

Go now. Go now. Go now
Don't you even try telling me
That you don't want me to end this way
'Cause, darling, darling,
Can't you see I want you to stay?

We've already said ‘Goodbye’.
Since you've got to go
Oh you had better go now.

Go now. Go now. Go now
Before you see me cry.
I don't want you to tell me
Just what you intend to do now.
'Cause how many times do I have to tell you
Darling, darling,
I'm still in love,
Still in love,
With you now?

I don't want to see you go
But, darling,
You'd better go now.
