A woman came and said to me
She'd seen a lady sell her baby
For ten or twenty dollars maybe
And everybody thinks she's crazy
They're too blind to see
She never failed to call attention
To the things we never mention
Real horror, daily, courtesy of your TV
C'est La Vie


A woman came and said to me
Now listen very carefully
There's brother killing brother
People living on their knees
Biting sugar coated bullets
For the pain of this disease
C'est La Vie

A woman came and said to me
She had a husband on an island
Found his body on a wasteland
Soldiers came and took him
Just to torture her you see
All alone she mourned her lover
Crossed the sea to find a brother
Maybe he could help her get her baby back for free
C'est La Vie
