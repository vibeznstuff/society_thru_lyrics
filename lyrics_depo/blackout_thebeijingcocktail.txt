I’ve gone and said it
Just so you know whats on my mind
I walk away now
This is over and theres no turning back
The way you parade is such a crime
I think about us
Your pretty eyes still give me heart attacks

And all we have is all thats left and it's for the best

We’ve been here before
We’ve fallen apart
You knew that it was over
You knew this from the start

I’ve gone and said it
Just so you know whats on my mind
I walk away now
This is over and theres no turning back
The way you parade is such a crime
I think about us
Your pretty eyes still give me heart attacks

And all we have is all thats left and it's for the best

We’ve been here before
We’ve fallen apart
You knew that it was over
You knew this from the start

I’m the devil from above just you wait and see
I can make any girl fall in love with me

I'm the devil from above just you wait and see
I can make any girl fall in love with me

We’ve been here before
We’ve fallen apart
You knew that it was over
You knew this from the start

No-one can save us
No-one can save us
No-one can save us
No-one can save us
