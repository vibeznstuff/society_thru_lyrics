First Thing in the morning when you just arrose your eyes still closed
Your getting up, your feeling down, maybe it cos your beds creased on one side 
you can't hide your face was smiling while you heart wears a frown
Always moving on, no place to go home living alone why should it have to be this way?

chorus- We all need someone to love,
we all need someone to love
holding and kissing you 
when you go missin you
Keeping you warm from the cold of the night
We all need oh someone to love

your running your hiding you hurt inside 
for memories you can't get away
from the pain in your heart 
tossing your turning you'll see all you would learn
in a childhood dream can keep it together while your world falls apart
your just like them, they don't agree, living alone why does it have to be this way?

repeat chorus

holding and kissing you when you go missing you
keeping you warm from the cold of the night
and to be your companion its all understanding your 
every need to be alright
holding and kissing you when you go missing you
keeping you warm from the cold of the night
and to be your companion its all understanding your
every need to be alright

we all need someone to love (repeat 6 times)
holding and kissing you when you missing you keeping
you warm from the cold from the cold of the night
we all need oh someone to love (to fade)
