I don't know what's going happen to you, baby
But I do know that I love ya
You walk around this town
With your head all up in the sky
And I do know that I want ya

Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake you body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake you body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake you body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake you body down to the ground

You tease me with your lovin'
To play hard to get
Cause you do know that I want ya
You walk around this town
With your head all up in the sky
And you do know that I want ya

Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake you body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake you body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake you body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake you body down to the ground

You are the spark that lit
The fire inside of me
And you know that I love it
I need to do just something
To get closer to your soul
And you do know that I want ya

Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake you body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake you body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake you body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake you body down to the ground
