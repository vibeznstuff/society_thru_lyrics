Secret. 
Secret. 

I've got a secret and I can't explain 
all the time I've waited for this day 
all along I was never in doubt 
I've always knew it could ever get out 
There are things that I cannot tell 
and there are things that you know damn well 
This is getting very hard for me 
I guess you'd better just wait and see 

Shut up! 
This is all 
This is all 
secret. 

You brought a message and the message was clear 
all the time you wipe away that tear 
all I want is to hold your hand 
to see the sun and walk the sand 
You make me sad as you make me glad 
And now you see all my secret is is love (is love...) 

Everyday I'm always there 
you can't fight me 
and make me feel it's worth my while 
and then I look around and you're not there 
and every day you say you can't hang out beware 

Secret. 
This is all 
This is all 
secret. 

I got a secret and I can't explain 
.. is this all 
All I want is to hold your hand 
.. is this all 
All along I was never in doubt 
.. is this all 
To see the sun and to walk the sand 
.. is this all Secret 

I got a secret and I can't explain 
All I want is to hold your hand
