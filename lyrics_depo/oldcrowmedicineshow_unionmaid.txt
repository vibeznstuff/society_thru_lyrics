Now, there once was a union maid
She never was afraid
Of the goons and the ginks
And the company finks
And the deputy sheriffs who made the raid
And she went to the union hall
Where a meeting, it was called
And when the boys would come up to her
Lord, this is what she'd say

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm stickin' to the union
I'm stickin' to the union, I'm stickin' to the union
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm stickin' to the union
I'm stickin' to the union, till the day I die

Now this union maid was wise
To the tricks of the company spies
She'd take the dare
She didn't care
She'd always organize the guys
And she always got her way
When she asked for better pay
She showed her card to the National Guard 
Honey, this is what they'd say

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm stickin' to the union
I'm stickin' to the union, I'm stickin' to the union
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm stickin' to the union
I'm stickin' to the union, till the day I die

Now, you girls who wanna be free
Just take a little tip from me
Oh, get you a man who's a union man
And you can join the Ladies' Auxiliary 
Because married life ain't hard
When you got a union card
And the union life is a happy life
If you've got a union wife

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm stickin' to the union
I'm stickin' to the union, I'm stickin' to the union
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm stickin' to the union
I'm stickin' to the union, till the day I die

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm stickin' to the union
I'm stickin' to the union, I'm stickin' to the union
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm stickin' to the union
I'm stickin' to the union, till the day I die
