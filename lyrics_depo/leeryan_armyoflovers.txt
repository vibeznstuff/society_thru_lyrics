There's an army of lovers dying to meet you
Dying to make your acquaintance
It could be you or it could be me
So don't let go
Because I need you so.

I'm yours, and you are mine
There's something about you baby
I want to hold you tonight

Accidents happen, strangest of places
How come they happen at all
Look for the turning for something or nothing
I wont let go
Because I need you so.

I'm yours and you are mine
There's something about you baby
I want to hold you tonight

Every time I see you, you complete my  life
Got to find an answer stay with me tonight
Stay with me, oh baby wont you stay with me
Stay with me

There's an army of lovers dying to meet you
Dying to make your acquaintance.
