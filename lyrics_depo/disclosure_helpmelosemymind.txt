Talk to me and watch me crumble
You will see me come undone
Faithfully I will look over
There I'll find what you've become
(What you've become)

You help me lose my mind
And you bring me something I can't define
Help me lose my mind, make me wonder
What I felt before
Keep biding my time,
How much longer?
Who've I been waiting for?

Jealousy will be washed over
Carefully we look on through
Could it be easy to start over?
Somehow I will bring you too
(What you've become)

You help me lose my mind
And you bring me something I can't define
Help me lose my mind, make me wonder
What I felt before
Keep biding my time,
How much longer?
Who've I been waiting for?

I've been waiting waiting waiting 

You help me lose my mind
And you bring me something I can't define
Help me lose my mind, make me wonder
What I felt before
Keep biding my time,
How much longer?
Who've I been waiting for?
