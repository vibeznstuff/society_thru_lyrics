I got Aretha
in the morning
high on my headphones and walking to school
I got the blues
in springtime
Cause I know that I’ll never have the right shoes

Mama she’d notice but she’s always crying
I got no-one to confide in
Aretha nobody but you
And mama she’d notice but she’s always fighting
something in her mind
and it sounds like breaking glass

I tell Aretha
in the morning
high on my headphones and walking to school
I got the blues
in springtime
Cause I know that I’ll never have the right shoes

“You got the words
Baby you got the words
You got the words
Baby you got the words!”

Oh Aretha
Aretha I don’t wanna go to school
Cause they just don’t understand me
and I think the place is cruel

“Child
Sing out
Raise your voice
Stand up on your own
Go out there and strike out!”

I tell Aretha
in the morning
high on my headphones and walking to school
I got the blues
in springtime
Cause I know that I’ll never have the right shoes
But I got the words
