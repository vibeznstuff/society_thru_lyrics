He's still driving that 1970 hand-me-down truck
And he's still wearing that red and black jersey
Waiting for the band to start up
He's still showing up twenty late, finding hearts and rules to break
Why would he wanna change when every memory still bows to him?

But this ain't high school
Where all you care about is if the pretty cheerleader thinks you're cool
See her Friday, take her out after the football game
'Cause it's five years later and you can't get off of the elevator
That's going up, 'cause you're growing up
And the world gets cruel when you're still living in high school

He's still calling that first love, first time, pretty-eyed blonde
And she's still letting it ring 'cause his ring isn't what she wants
'Cause she traded in prom queen for a big city dream
And a slate that's clean, but
Your heart just don't get it and that's why you can't forget it
'Cause you're living like you're seventeen

But this ain't high school
Where all you care about is if the pretty cheerleader thinks you're cool
See her Friday, take her out after the football game
'Cause it's five years later and you can't get off of the elevator
That's going up, 'cause you're growing up and the world gets cruel when...

You're still living in the hallways
Where everybody stopped and stared
And cared and knew your name
Cause this is the real world that don't know you like that
You can remember but you can't go back

To high school
Where all you care about is if the pretty cheerleader thinks you're cool
See her Friday when you take her out after the football game
'Cause it's five years later and you can't get off of the elevator
That's going up, 'cause you're growing up
And the world gets cruel when you're still living in high school

When you're still living in...
Five years later
Oh yeah, oh yeah
He's still calling that first love, first time
And he hates he said goodbye, she went on with her life
He's still driving the same old back roads
Wondering when he got so old
Where did his life go?
Oh, but he knows
Oh, he knows
Yeah, he knows
That this ain't high school, oh, woah
And he's still driving that 1970 hand-me-down truck
And he's stuck in high school
But this ain't high school
