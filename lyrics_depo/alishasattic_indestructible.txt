Don't look no more, 
Coz it'll only make your eyes sore 
Hey! Count your R.E.M's, 
It's comforting the sanctuary there we have 
(ooo oo, we argue sometimes and we fear we put the knife in too deep 
but even when madness heads, it's only gladness I keep inside inside) 
So give me a sign 
Coz we are Indestructible 
Yes we are 
And you are my life-line 
And we are Indestructible 
Yes we are, mmm 

Do do, do do, do do, do do, do do, do do 

Hey, hey, you can be wicked 
And you know I can be fickle sometimes too, y'know 
Maybe you're my better side 
(better side) 
Or maybe you annoy me to the point of where I'm holding this 
(gun against your head, but I never said we have the same free spirit, 
tell me will you cry? Don't cry) 
So give me a sign 

Coz we are Indestructible 
Yeah we are 
And you are my life-line 
And we are Indestructible 
Yes we are, mmm 

Do do, do do, do do, do do, do do, do do, do do 

You take me as I am, mister 
I've a little red devil on my shoe 
You always stay real strong 
You can take the rough with the smooth 
And I know that we forget what we mean to say 
Too proud sometimes 
Guess we're only human 

Coz we are Indestructible 
Yeah we are 
And you are my life-line 
We are Indestructible 
Yes we are 
So give me a sign
