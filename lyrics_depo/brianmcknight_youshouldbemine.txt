Mase, and Brian McKnight, Bad Boy 
C'mon 
We don't stop, we rock we rock 
Yo 
I hit you with the sound that the world can't take 
Can't sit out the gig playing 2.8 
Real studded jewel funded 
Got to love it 
First rap cat with the R&amp;B budget 
Every day on the TV me and PD 
Girl's so pretty, make their man break the CD 
Why y'all forever roudy 
I be out here somewhere in Maui 
Till I go back to Cali 

Can't understand how he can treat you the that way he does 
Give me the chance to show you baby, your better off with me 
(OOh, so will you let me try 
I wanna make you smile) 
I wanna love you like you need to be loved 
(I'll never let you go 
I'll always be around) 
And you should be mine 
(He don't love you right 
Don't waste your time 
Don't waste your time) 
He don't treat you like he should (no baby) 
You should be mine 
You should be mine, baby 
Why can't you see 
You should be happy 
And I don't know why you don't believe a man can love you for the 
rest of your life 
(So baby let me try 
I wanna make you smile) 
I wanna love you like you need to be loved 
(I'll never let you down 
I'll always be around) 
And you should be mine 
He don't love you right (Ooh) 
Don't waste your time 
Don't waste your time 
He don't treat you like he should (now) 
Then you should be mine 
You should be mine (Ooh ooh) 

Yo! 
What the deal honey 
Insecure feel funny 
I know you're used to dealin' with cats with real money 
Plus I know you're like Mase in alot of ways 
But it's hard to go on when you're lonely in the holidays 
When you shopping did you shop for 2 
Uh! 
Take you where the waters aqua blue 
Let you fall back 
Treat you like you're all that 
Under umbrellas with your shades and straw hat 
You ain't the one out clubbing all day and all night 
Just to save a fight 
Or say he's right 
And I know he ain't the cat that will stay in you life 
Even though he gave you ice gown that will make you his wife 
How a man deserve you if he hurt you 
Then he give a woman 25 a curfew 
Between me and you, you ain't heard that from me 
Cuz Mase ain't the player with the PhD 

Girl come into my world 
I love you the way that you need to be loved 
No worries, no more 
Girl open the door 
And don't waste your time 
Cuz you should be mine 
He don't love you right (ooh baby) 
Don't waste your time (don't waste your time) 
He don't treat you like he should (ooh) 
You should be mine (should be mine, baby baby) 
He don't love you right 
Don't waste your time (don't waste your time)
