Woh-oh-oh-oh, can't give you more, can't give you more
Woh-oh-oh-oh, can't give you more, can't give you more

Now you know this ain't the kind of life for you
It's not the way you thought that it would be
If I could change my way for you
If I could change it wouldn't be me, can you see?
I know I never tried the things I should have done
And time is always passing by.
I want to do the things I've never done before
So I do try not to tell a lie
When I'm so low, and I'm so high
But You cry when I say I can't give you more

First you said you'd never try to slow me down
That everything would work out really fine
But as those walls closed in on us
The words just fell right out of line, and behind
I know I never tried the things I should have done
And time is always passing by.
I want to do the things I've never done before
So I do try not to tell a lie
When I'm so low, and I'm so high
But You cry when I say I can't give you more

Woh-oh-oh-oh, can't give you more, can't give you more
Woh-oh-oh-oh, can't give you more, can't give you more

Did you figure ours would be an easy thing?
Like lazy days of lying in the sun.
I told you if you wanted me
That every day just wouldn't be fun, now it's done.
I know I've never tried the things I should have done
And time is always passing by.
I want to do the things I've never done before
So I do try not to tell a lie
When I'm so low, and I'm so high
But You cry when I say I can't give you more

Woh-oh-oh-oh, can't give you more, can't give you more
Woh-oh-oh-oh, can't give you more, can't give you more
