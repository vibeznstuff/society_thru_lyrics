There are times when I don't know where I stand (oh, sometimes)
You make me feel like I'm a boy and not a man (oh, sometimes)
There are times when you don't give me a smile (oh, sometimes)
I lie awake at night and worry for a while (oh, oh)

It's OK 'cause I know
You shine even on a rainy day and
I can find your halo
Guides me to wherever you fall
If you need a hand to hold
I'll come running, because
You and I won't part till we die
You should know
We see eye to eye, heart to heart.

There are times when I cry 'cause you shed no tears (oh, sometimes)
Your mind's so far away but your body's right here (oh, sometimes)
There are times when I just walked out your door (oh, sometimes)
And thought I'd never get to see you anymore (oh, oh)

It's OK 'cause I know
You shine even on a rainy day
And I can find your halo
Guides me to wherever you fall
If you need a hand to hold
I'll come running, because
You and I won't part till we die
You should know
We see eye to eye, heart to heart.

Woah... woah...
Oh sometimes
Woah... woah...

Wherever you fall
If you need a hand to hold
I'll come running, because
You and I won't part till we die
You should know
We see eye to eye, heart to heart.

I can find your halo
Guides me to wherever you fall
