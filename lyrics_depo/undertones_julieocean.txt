So sad to see you've got silver
She's gonna break your dancing heart
Nothing good lasts forever
And sometimes nothing starts

Julie Ocean - always on fire
Julie Ocean - crazy desire

You can't scratch her serious anger
Or touch her sensitive nerve
Watch her faking her power
Smiling as she would

Julie Ocean - always on fire
Julie Ocean - crazy desire

That's typical girl

Julie Ocean - always on fire
Julie Ocean - crazy desire
