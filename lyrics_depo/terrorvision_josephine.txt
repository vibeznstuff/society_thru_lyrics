I had a friend called Joe,
When friends were hard to find,
He had a restless soul,
And something on his mind,
One day I went away,
and then returned to the scene,
Not to find restless Joe no,
But to find Josephine,

I asked her what her game was,
She said Joe had left the scene,
I asked her what her name was,
And she said.......They call me Josephine.

It took a while to click,
But then I got the gist,
The girl by my side,
Was the guy I'd missed,
I took her for a beer,
To talk about old times,
Just to find that beer,
Was now a sweet white wine, 

I asked her what her game was,
She said Joe had left the scene,
I asked her what her name was,
And she said.......They call me Josephine.

So we talked all night,
And I just can't pretend,
Although I lost old Joe,
I got a new girlfriend,

I asked her what her game was,
She said Joe had left the scene,
I asked her what her name was,
And she said.......They call me Josephine.
I asked her what her game was,
She said Joe had left the scene,
I asked her what her name was,
And she said.......They call me Josephine.
