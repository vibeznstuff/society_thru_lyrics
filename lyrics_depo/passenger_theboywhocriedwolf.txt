Well I am the boy who cried wolf
And I know I've lied in the past
But last night I saw his yellow eyes shining in the dark
Yeah I know I spun tales with his voice
And I open my mouth too fast
But last night I saw his footprints in the path

Well I could swim every sea from south pole to north
But I know I'll only ever be the boy who cried wolf

Well I am the shepherds only son
And I know what a joke I've become;
I have an honest heart but I have lies on my tongue
I don't know how this started or where it came from
And you have no reason and I have no proof
But this time I swear, I'm telling the truth
I saw that old wolf, from tail to tooth
And I know that he's hungry and he's coming down too

Well I could swim every sea from south pole to north
And I could climb every tree, and scale every coarse
Well I could tell only the truth from this day forth
But I know I'll only ever be the boy who cried wolf

Oh, oh I am the boy who cried wolf
Oh, I am the boy who cried wolf
