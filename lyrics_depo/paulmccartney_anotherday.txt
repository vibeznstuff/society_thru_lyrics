Every day she takes a morning bath, she wets her hair,
Wraps a towel 'round her as she's heading for the bedroom chair,
It's just another day.
Slippin' into stockings,
Steppin' into shoes,
Dippin' in the pocket of her raincoat,

It's just another day.

At the office where the papers grow she takes a break,
Drinks another coffee and she finds it hard to stay awake,

It's just another day,
Choo choo choo choo choo choo,
It's just another day,
Choo choo choo choo choo choo,
It's just another day.

So sad, so sad,
Sometimes she feels so sad,
Alone in her apartment she'd dwell,
Til the man of her dreams comes to break the spell.

Ah... Stay,
Don't stand her up,
Then he comes and he stays,
But he leaves the next day... so sad,
Sometimes she feels so sad...

As she posts another letter to the sound of five,
People gather 'round her and she finds it hard to stay alive,

It's just another day,
Choo choo choo choo choo choo,
It's just another day,
Choo choo choo choo choo choo,
It's just another day.

So sad, so sad,
Sometimes she feels so sad,
Alone in her apartment she'd dwell,
'Til the man of her dreams comes to break the spell.

Ah... Stay,
Don't stand her up,
And he comes and he stays,
But he leaves the next day... so sad,
Sometimes she feels so sad.

Everyday she takes a morning bath, she wets her hair,
Wraps a towel 'round her as she's heading for the bedroom chair,
It's just another day.

Slippin' into stockings,
Steppin' into shoes,
Dippin' in the pocket of her raincoat,

Ah, It's just another day,
Choo choo choo choo choo choo,
It's just another day,
Choo choo choo choo choo choo,
It's just another day.
