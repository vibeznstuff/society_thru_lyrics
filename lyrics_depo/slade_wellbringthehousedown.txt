We'll bring the house down

Woh oh oh oh oh
Woh oh oh oh oh
Woh oh oh oh oh
Woh oh oh oh oh

Turn the megawatts way up loud
Send an Earth tremor thru the crowd
C'mon, heads down shakin', c'mon
120 In decibels
A rock an rollin' with armpit smells
C'mon, heads start shakin', c'mon

I said
We'll bring the house down
We'll bring the house down
We'll bring the house down
You're gonna get it
You're gonna get it
You're gonna get it
Yow!

Headbangers don't buy no soul
All they wanna do is rock'n'roll away
Let the bass blow you away
Imaginary playing heavy riffs
No diminisheds or fancy fifths
C'mon, heads down shakin', c'mon

We'll bring the house down
We'll bring the house down
We'll bring the house down
You're gonna get it
You're gonna get it
You're gonna get it

Woh oh oh oh oh - oh oh oh oh oh
Woh oh oh oh oh - oh oh oh oh oh
We'll bring the house down - oh oh oh oh oh
We'll bring the house down - oh oh oh oh oh



Ohhh
Days later your ears are still ringin'
No voice from shouting and singing it out
Sweat it and get it out

We'll bring the house down - oh oh oh oh oh
We'll bring the house down - oh oh oh oh oh
We'll bring the house down - oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna get it
You're gonna get it
