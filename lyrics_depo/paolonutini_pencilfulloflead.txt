Oh, 1,
1, 2, 3, 4
Ooh, I got a sheet for my bed,
And a pillow for my head
I got a pencil full of lead,
And some water for my throat
I've got buttons for my coat; and sails on my boat
So much more than I needed before
I got money in the meter and a two bar heater
Now it's getting hotter;
Oh it's oly getting sweeter
I got legs on my chairs and a head full of hair
Pot and a pan
And some shoes on my feet;
I got a shelf full of books and most of my teeth
A few pairs of socks and a door with a lock
I got food in my belly and a license for my telly
And nothing's going to bring me down

Oh no, oh nothings, oh nothings, oh nothings,
Nothings gonna bring me down

I got a nice guitar and tyres on my car
I got most of the means; and scripts for the scenes
I'm out and about, so I'm in with a shout
I got a fair bit of chat but better than that
Food in my belly and a license for my telly
And nothing's going to bring me down

Nothing's going to bring me down

But best of all (best of all)
I've got my baby
She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
And nothing's going to bring me down

Ooh, best of all
I've got my baby


She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
And nothing's going to bring me down

Ooh, best of all
I've got my baby


She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
And nothing's going to bring me down


Not today, no, no
