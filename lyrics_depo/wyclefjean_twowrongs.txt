(Oooh) 
I'm just sittin here playing the guitar (Oooh) 
(City High.. Claudette.. Wyclef) 



Excuse me, if you see me screaming 
Deep in my mind, i'm only dreaming 
cuz if i wake girl, and you're not by my side 
i'd feel like half of me, is no longer alive 
so please shorty, before you walk out that door 
would you listen to my song 


if only, i give you one last chance 
with the devil, you can no longer dance 
you got to be faithful, so we could be fruitful 
build a family, and follow god faithfully 
so just before i want to reply, i might listen to your song 


ooh, before you walk out that door, listen 



they say two wrongs don't make it right ((don't make it right)) 
So if i'm wrong i ain't trying to fight 
I'm trying to have some dinner with some candlelight ((yeeahh)) 
lay up in the bed and make love all night 

So papi I wont leave, maybe i'll just stay 
you promise me that you'll do the same 


girl i'ma love you like i never love 
((touch me like you never touch me)) 
yo if you give me the chance girl 
((yeah baby)) 
I'm gonna show you 



I'm gonna say ((i understand)) 
that i forgive you 
and i aint gonna forget 
that you brought me ?? ((baby, baby, baby)) 


But i have grown 
from a thug to a man 
Build my castle with bricks 
and no longer with sand 
Oh Girl 


And just, before I want to reply, baby 
I might listen to your song 


Ooh, before you walk out that door, listen 



they say two wrongs don't make it right ((don't make it right)) 
So if i'm wrong i ain't trying to fight ((i don't wanna fight)) 
I'm trying to have some dinner with some candlelight ((yeeahh)) 
lay up in the bed and make love all night 

So papi I wont leave, maybe i'll just stay 
you promise me that you'll do the same 


and i'ma love you like i never love 
((touch me like you never touch me)) 
yo if you give me the chance girl 
I'm gonna show you 



I'm so used to the pain that I 
Can't see the sunshine no more 
I'm so used to the pain that the 
the sickness feels like the cure 


Ay, but if only you gave me 
the keys to your soul 
and let me in 
i'm gonna love you 
over ((over)), and over ((over)) again
