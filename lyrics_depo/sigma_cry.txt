I've been drowning in the river
Tried to soothe my soul
Take me under, take me deeper
Than I choose to go
I can't see it any clearer
I said long ago
But down here underneath the surface
You're my only hope

If you remember me everyone else can forget
Everyone else can forget
Tell them I have nothing, nothing

Cause I'd rather go blind
Than watch you walk out of my life
Turn my face up to the sky
You know we all, we all, we all, we all cry
Heart on the line for the love we left behind
I can't let you go this time
And oh I know, I know, I know you hear me
Cry, cry, cry, cry
I know, I know, I know you hear me

I've been waiting for the storm
To surrender my soul
Bathe me in your holy water and lay me down

If you remember me everyone else can forget
Everyone else can forget
Tell them I have nothing, nothing

Cause I'd rather go blind
Than watch you walk out of my life
Turn my face up to the sky
You know we all, we all, we all, we all cry
Heart on the line for the love we left behind
I can't let you go this time
And oh I know, I know, I know you hear me
Cry, cry, cry
I know, I know, I know you hear me
Cry, cry, cry
I know, I know, I know you hear me

Surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender, surrender
Cause I surrender

Cause I'd rather go blind
Than watch you walk out of my life
Turn my face up to the sky
You know we all, we all, we all, we all cry
Heart on the line for the love we left behind
I can't let you go this time
And oh I know, I know, I know you hear me
Cry, cry, cry
I know, I know, I know you hear me
Cry, cry, cry
I know, I know, I know you hear me cry
