You know nothing come easy, you gotta try real real hard, I tried hard...but I guess I
gotta try harder.



I try so hard can't seem to get away from misery
man I try so hard
will always be a victim of these streets
it ain't my fault cause I...
tried to get away but trouble follows me
and still I try so hard
hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
but until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
but until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat getting dough



First let me explain that I'm just a black man
and I come from the darkside, so I'm having a hard time staying on track man my mind be
racing, and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet I been in and out of relationships, I'm
starting to see thats it's me where the complications at, but I'm laying back praying that,
you can't have piece of mind of me, I thought I was right but really I'm wrong, in the end
I was to blind to see, I was in the fast lane chasin' my dream, and then it seem when the
fame and cash came they just got me going crazy lately, lately, lately I been so faded
trying to erase it but I cant cause the drama just goes greater and I been in so many
collisions from putting shit up till later



I try so hard
can't seem to get away from misery

It's like I'm taking 5 steps forward and 10 steps back, trying to get ahead of the game,
but I can't seem to get it on track, and I keep running away from the ones that say they
love me the most how could I create the distance when it's suppose to be close and uh, I
just don't know but I be out here fighting demons and, it's like a curse that I can't shake
this part of Cleveland and lord, would you help me? and stop this pain I keep inflicting on
my family hustling gambling, tricking and scamming scrambling and losing sight of what I'm
suppose to be handling, it's hard to manage cause everyday's a challenge and man I'm slipping
can't lose my balance I'm trying not to panic

back mayne got me doin' dirty dirt so used to this hustlin' money that I don't understand
