Safety...dance...

We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well, they're no friends of mine
I say, we can go where we want to
A place where they will never find
And we can act like we come from out of this world
Leave the real one far behind
And we can dance (Come see!)

We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well, they're no friends of mine
I say, we can go where we want to
A place where they will never find
And we can act like we come from out of this world
Leave the real one far behind
And we can dance
(We can dance, we can dance, everything's out of control)
(We can dance, we can dance, we're doing it from wall to wall)

We can go when we want to
The night is young and so am I
And we can dress real neat
From our hats to our feet
And surprise 'em with a victory cry
I say, we can act if we want to
If we don't nobody will
And you can act real rude
And totally removed
And I can act like an imbecile

I say, we can dance, we can dance, everything's out of control (Out of control!)
We can dance, we can dance, we're doing it from wall to wall (Wall to wall!)
We can dance, we can dance, everybody look at your hands (Look at your hands, yeah...)
We can dance, we can dance, everybody's takin' the chance
It's safety dance
Well it's safety dance
Yeah it's safety dance

S-S-S-S, A-A-A-A, F-F-F-F, E-E-E-E, T-T-T-T, Y-Y-Y-Y
Safety...dance...

We can dance if we want to
We've got all your life and mine
As long as we abuse it
Never gonna lose it
Everything'll work out right
I say, we can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well, they're are no friends of mine

I say, we can dance, we can dance, everything's out of control (Out of control!)
We can dance, we can dance, we're doing it from wall to wall (Wall to wall!)
We can dance, we can dance, everybody look at your hands (Out of control!)
We can dance, we can dance, everybody's takin' the chance
Oh well, safety dance
Oh yes, safety dance
Oh well, safety dance
Oh yes, safety dance
Oh well, safety dance
Oh, safety dance
Oh, it's safety dance
It's safety dance
It's safety dance
It's safety dance!
