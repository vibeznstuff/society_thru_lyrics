You crossed this line
Do you find it hard to sit with me tonight?
I've walked these miles but I've walked 'em straight lined
You'll never know what was like to be fine

I'm wasting my young years
It doesn't matter if...
I'm chasing old ideas
It doesn't matter if...

Maybe...
We are
We are
Maybe I'm wasting my young years
Maybe...
We are
We are
Maybe I'm wasting my young years

Don't you know that it's only fear
I wouldn't worry, you have all your life
I've heard it takes some time to get it right

I'm wasting my young years
It doesn't matter if...
I'm chasing old ideas
It doesn't matter if...

Maybe...
We are
We are
Maybe I'm wasting my young years
Maybe...
We are
We are
Maybe I'm wasting my young years

I don't know what you want
Don't leave me hanging on
Don't know what you want
Don't leave me hanging on
