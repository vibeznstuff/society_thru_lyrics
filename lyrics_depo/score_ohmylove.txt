Oh my love, let me be your fire
We're a thousand miles up and I'm 'bout to get higher
Feel my heart beating out my chest
You're the only prayer I need to make me feel blessed

Singing oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh

Rest your head like it was made of stone
Next to mine, darling lay your bones
I hold you closer, let me show
We'll shape this world like it was meant to be
Made of clay for only you and me
Awake with you is better than a dream
Better than a dream

Oh my love, let me be your fire
We're a thousand miles up and I'm 'bout to get higher
Feel my heart beating out my chest
You're the only prayer I need to make me feel blessed

Singing oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh

Safe and sound is all you'll ever know
Shake the ground, the higher that we go
We'll take the stars and show 'em how to glow
Yeah, 'cause life is more than just a waiting game
And we're not waiting 'til it's time to play
The only rules I play by are you
Play by you

Oh my love, let me be your fire
We're a thousand miles up and I'm 'bout to get higher
Feel my heart beating out my chest
You're the only prayer I need to make me feel blessed

Singing oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh

I won't be afraid
If my spirit fades
'Cause when I see your face
I know that I am saved

I won't be afraid
If my spirit fades
'Cause when I see your face
I'm saved

Oh my love, let me be your fire
We're a thousand miles up and I'm 'bout to get higher
Feel my heart beating out my chest
You're the only prayer I need to make me feel blessed, singing

Oh my love, let me be your fire
We're a thousand miles up and I'm 'bout to get higher
Feel my heart beating out my chest
You're the only prayer I need to make me feel blessed

Singing oh oh oh
Oh oh oh (You're the only prayer I need to make me feel blessed)
Oh oh oh
Oh oh

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh (You're the only prayer I need to make me feel blessed)
Oh oh oh
Oh oh

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh

You make me feel blessed
You make me feel blessed
You're the only prayer I need to make me feel blessed
