It picks me up, puts me down again
I never know when my troubles will end
This little street with it's den of sin
Where I see all my fair-weather friends

And it's good when I'm a little high
And it's good, my glass is never dry
And it's good when everything is spinning
Now I feel like I'm finally winning

Na na na na, na na na na na na
We're all living on Sun Street
Na na na na, na na na na na na
We're all living on Sun Street, yay

It makes me blue, but keeps me coming round
Life is cheap, a smile is free
Before the dust on the window pane
It's hard to see Sun Street's not for me

But it's good when I'm a little high
And it's good, my glass is never dry
And it's good when everything is spinning
Now I feel like I'm finally winning

Na na na na, na na na na na na
We're all living on Sun Street
Na na na na, na na na na na na
We're all living on Sun Street

But it's good when I'm a little high
And it's good, my glass is never dry
And it's good when everything is spinning
Now I feel like I'm finally winning

Na na na na, na na na na na na
We're all living on Sun Street
Na na na na, na na na na na na
We're all living on Sun Street

Na na na na, na na na na na na
We're all living on Sun Street
Na na na na, na na na na na na
We're all living on Sun Street

Everybody - Na na na na, na na na na na na
We're all living on Sun Street
Na na na na, na na na na na na
We're all living on Sun Street
