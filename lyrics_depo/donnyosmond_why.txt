I'll never let you go
Why? Because I love you
I'll always love you so
Why? Because you love me
No broken hearts for us, 'cause we love eachother
And with our faith and trust there could be no other
Why? 'Cause I love you
Why? 'Cause you love me

And I think you're awful sweet 
Why? Because I love you
You say I'm your special treat
Why? Because you love me
We've found the perfect love,
yes, a love that's your's and mine
I love you and you love me all the time



Yes I love you
Oh, you love me

We've found the perfect love
Yes, a love that's your's and mine
I love you and you love me
I love you and, baby, you love me
We'll love eachother dear forever
