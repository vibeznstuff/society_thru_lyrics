See I like Beyonce, but she dey with Jigga
I like Nikki, her yansh is bigger
I like Rihanna, she dey make me day go gaga
I like Omotola cos people like her
I like Genevieve, I think that she's so sweet
And Nadia Buhari, cos she no dey drink garri
It's not her fault you know
You cannot blame me though
I wanna have them all
I know it's wrong but the truth is that

I am just an Oliver

You wanna have them all
You know it's wrong
But the truth is that
