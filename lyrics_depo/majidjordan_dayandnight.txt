I know it may feel like you're wasting your time
But I hope and I pray that you never lose sight

You know what to do
You know what to do
You know how to ease my mind
You know what to do
Now that I'm with you
I love you and you love me
Day and night
Day and night
Because I treat your body right
Your body right
Your body right
You got a heart of gold

I know how it feels, when there's nowhere to hide
But here, as we speak, I feel madness subside

You know what to do
You know what to do
You know how to ease my mind
You know what to do
Now that I'm with you
I love you and you love me
Day and night
Day and night
Because I treat your body right
Your body right
Your body right
You got a heart of gold

A heart of gold
A hand to hold
A good soul
That's what I'm looking for
I want somebody real
To show me how it feels
So if it feels good, don't let me down

You know what to do
You know what to do
You know how to ease my mind
You know what to do
Now that I'm with you
I love you and you love me
Day and night
Day and night
Because I treat your body right
Your body right
Your body right
You got a heart of gold

Now dance with me
Now dance with me
Now dance with me
Now dance with me
(You got a heart of gold)
Now dance with me
D-Day and night
D-Day and night
D-Day and night
D-Day and night
(You got a heart of gold)
(You got a heart of gold)
(You)
Day, day, day
Day, day, day and night
Day, day, day
Day, day, day and night
