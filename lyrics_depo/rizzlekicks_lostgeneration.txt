I said I'm living in a
Lost generation
I said I'm living in a
Lost generation
I've got my heart
I found my soul
I'm living, I'm living life man

Switch on the TV
They keep it real
But not in that way
I turn the channel
And just see somebody's life displayed
Awkward pauses and dodgy moments
I smile it keeps me sane
Reality TV is morphine
Give me that now let me ease the pain
(Oh yeah)
Man, talent shows
I seen some of our friends
Go and beat their targets
I've also seen careers end
When they ain't even really started
Jeremy Kyle got the nation laughing
At other people's expense
Somebody tell that guy that we hate him
Too, we are not his friends
#trend
We make people go
Clap clap yeah
When I heard people buy views
I was more confused
Than all John Terry's black friends
Watch your mouth son
#trend
Oi big brothers in the house now yeah
I said screw the voting and talking
I just wanna see
People fight an have sex so let's say
Hey (hey)

I'm living, I'm living life man
Say hey (hey)
I'm living, I'm living life
I've got my heart
I found my soul
I'm living, I'm living
I said I'm living in a
Lost generation
I said I'm living in a
Lost generation
I've got my heart
I found my soul
I'm living, I'm living
I'm living life man

I wanna dance
I wanna have fun
Let me feel the music
I hope you realize how dumb you sound
When you call us stupid
I wanna drive to work
Hear this beat and
Make my dreams come true
Keep it up man
A beat like this
Reminds my heart what to do
Salute
I want you to feel useless baby
That's right every bad boy should
And damn right I'm a slut
You know this
But I'm a boy it's all good
Take snaps of me I'm an icon
Standing here in my shades
Oi be someone
If you beg to be followed
Then you've lost your way
#trend
We make people go
Clap clap yeah
Why is everybody so PC
It's not my fault if you take offence
Watch your mouth son
#trend
What's wrong if a girl loves sex
It's only wrong if it's not with you
So maybe you should get better in bed
(You naughty boy)

Say hey (hey)
I'm living, I'm living life man
Say hey (hey)
I'm living, I'm living life
I've got my heart
I found my soul
I'm living, I'm living
I said I'm living in a
Lost generation
I said I'm living in a
Lost generation
I've got my heart
I found my soul
I'm living, I'm living,
I'm living life man
