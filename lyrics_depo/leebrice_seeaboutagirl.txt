Well me and the boys are feelin' alright
Raisin' some hell, sippin' on whiskey and 'shine, yeah
Bob Dylan on the juke box, shooting' some pool
Telling' some stories and stretching the truth and lies
Yeah, I feel the cell phone start buzzing in my pocket 

Boys, you keep on rocking' but I gotta roll, roll, 
Point this Silverado down the road, road
Yeah, I know the beer's here are cold
But I've got something' warm waiting for me at home
Boys, I gotta go see about a girl

Ain't nothin' you can say, so don't even try
The second she call that little girl made up my mind, 
Yeah, she did
Don't' buy me no shot, don't bring me no drink
Don't go wasting' your money on me, bye, bye

Boys, you keep on rocking' but I gotta roll, roll, 
Point this Silverado down the road, road
Yeah, I know the beer's here are cold
But I've got something' warm waiting for me at home
Boys, I gotta go see about a girl

If you ever find a girl like mine,
Boys you'll know why

I gotta roll, roll
Point my Silverado down the road, road
Yeah, I know the beer's here are cold
But I've got something' warm waiting for me at home
Boys, I gotta go see about a girl
Sorry Boys, I gotta go see about my girl

Ooh ooh oh yeah
Ooh ooh oh
