She plays wipeout on the drums
the squirrels and the birds come
Gather around to sing the guitar
Oh I...have you got nothing to say

When all words fail she speaks
Her mix tape's a masterpiece 
Walks through the garden
so the roses can see
Oh I...have you got nothing to say
And you can see the daisies 
in her footsteps
Dandelions, butterflies
I wanna be Kate

Everyday she wars the same thing
I think she smokes pot
She's everything I need, She's everything I'm not
Oh. I...
Have you got nothing to say

She never gets wet 
She smiles and it's a rainbow
And she speaks and she breathes
I wanna be Kate

Down by the Rosemary and Cameron
She hands out the
Bhagaved Gita
I see her around every couple days
I wanna meet her so that 
I can say...hey Kate
