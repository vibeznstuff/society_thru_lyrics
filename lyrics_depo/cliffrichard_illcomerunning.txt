Matter of fact
You're on the right track
My future looks black and blue

Didn't take long
To see I was wrong
That I still got it strong for you

I'll come running, yeah (I'll come running, yeah)
If you want me to (If you want me to)
I'll come running, yeah (I'll come running, yeah)
'Cause I'm done, yeah, without you

Give my life sure
To take back the words
That brought all that hurt upon earth

We both made mistakes
Had some bad breaks
But we got what it takes to go on

I'll come running, yeah (I'll come running, yeah)
If you want me to (If you want me to)
I'll come running, yeah (I'll come running, yeah)
'Cause I'm done, yeah, without you

I'll come running, yeah (I'll come running, yeah)
Oh, if you want me to (If you want me to)
I'll come running, yeah (I'll come running, yeah)
'Cause I'm done, yeah, without you

Yeah, I'll come running, yeah (If you want me to)
Oho
