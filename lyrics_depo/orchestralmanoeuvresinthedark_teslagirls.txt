NO NO NO
Tesla Girls Tesla Girls
Testing out theories
Electric Chairs and dynamos
Dressed to kill They're killing me
But Heaven knows their recipe

NO NO NO

You wouldn't believe me if I said
The things I've seen went over my head
I've been patient Heaven knows
I've learnt the rules and how it goes
I can't sit still or settle down
And when I walk I don't touch the ground
See those girls they're Heaven blessed
I guess it's so they know best

Tesla Girls Tesla Girls
Writing in their diaries
Now and then they'll watch TV
Now and then they'll speak to me
But Heaven knows their recipe

NO NO NO

You wouldn't believe them if they said
The things they've seen went over their heads
They've been patient Heaven knows
They seem to care and so it goes
They can't sit still or settle down
And when they walk they don't touch the ground
See those girls they're Heaven blessed
I guess it's so they know best

Testing out theories
Electric chairs and dynamos
Dressed to kill they're killing me

I'm in love with Tesla Girls
Now and then they'll watch TV
Now and then they'll speak to me
But heaven knows their recipe
