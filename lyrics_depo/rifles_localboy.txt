Jimmy was a local boy but he's seen much more than the change in the weather
Sitting in a uniform of a three-piece suit and the ribbons from his past
Looking through a little boy at the bar with the mouth who thinks his clever now
Dreaming of a day that he goes home from a war to his childhood sweetheart

Now he don't need anyone, there's no one there for him
Just a feeling of an empty place deteriorating
Jimmy was a local boy, but he's seen much more than I'm bound to ever
A member of a dying breed that sat and wait as it all just falls apart
Dreaming of a day that's oh so long ago, that he can't remember right
There was a time a man can still be a man and be proud to use his heart

Now he don't need anyone, there's no one there for him
There was really only one
Now he misses how she sounds, he frowns, line 'em up and he puts them down
It's sad this town seems to fail to appreciate the man

Now he don't need anyone, there's no one there for him
No he don't feel any more 'cause jimmy's so thick-skinned
And a long long time ago, when he could break her heart
There was really only one
Now he misses how she sounds, he frowns, line em up and he puts em down
Its sad this town seems to fail to appreciate what he's about
Line 'em up and he puts them down
It's sad this town seems to fail to appreciate the man
