I found a map and it broke my heart
I didn't know that I'd ever go this far
With a compass point driving ink into my arm
The father, son and the holy ghost
We don't talk too much, never been that close
Pouring spirits while I follow the Northern star

And as the birds fly south
I've been missing a small house
That holds all my words in precious store
I found your message lying at the bottom of a bottle
Come back to where the streets are paved with stone

I believe in you
You believe in me
You're the lighthouse in the storm
I believe it's true
I can follow you
Back to where the streets are paved with stone

I'd swap the scent of open ocean air
For the factory steel and the engineers
Well I'm coming back to something beautiful
All the noise and all the lights
Are all the things I'd sacrifice
I'd trade it for the way you make me feel

And as the days they pass
Falling through the hour glass
Used to be beneath my feet along the shore
I find your message lying at the bottom of a bottle
Come back to where the streets are paved with stone

I believe in you
You believe in me
You're the lighthouse in the storm
I believe it's true
I can follow you
Back to where the streets are paved with stone 

Once around the world 
Back to you
Once around the world 
Back to you

I believe in you
You believe in me
You're the lighthouse in the storm
I believe it's true
I can follow you
Back to where the streets are paved with stone 

Once around the world,
Once around the world

Back to where the streets are paved in stone
