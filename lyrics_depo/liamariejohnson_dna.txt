Dark as midnight
Six pack Coors Light
You don't look the same

Past my bedtime
Blue and red lights
Come take you away

Hate to see you like a monster
So I run and hide
Hate to ask but what's it like to leave me behind

I won't be, no I won't be like you
Fighting back, I'm fighting back the truth
Eyes like yours can't look away
But you can't stop DNA
No, you can't stop DNA

Twice a year, you come in crashing
Nice to see you too
Johnny Cash and backseat laughing
Always ends too soon

Hate to say hello 'cause I know that it means goodbye
Hate to ask but what's it like to leave me behind

I won't be, no I won't be like you
Fighting back, I'm fighting back the truth
Eyes like yours can't look away
But you can't stop DNA
No, you can't stop DNA

Are the pieces of you
In the pieces of me?
I'm just so scared
You're who I'll be
When I erupt
Just like you do
They look at me
Like I look at you

I won't be, no I won't be like you
Fighting back, I'm fighting back the truth
Eyes like yours can't look away
But you can't stop DNA
No, you can't stop DNA
