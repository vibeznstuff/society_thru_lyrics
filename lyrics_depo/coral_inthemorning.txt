Shut the bedroom window in the morning 
Go to the shop, make plans to be leaving 
In the morning

Thought I was sleeping, it was just a dream
An alley cat chewing on dead leaves
In the morning

Out of the dark and into the light
When the morning comes, I will be all right

When I leave, I try not to wake her
Tea and a toast to yesterday's capers
In the morning

She wrote my name on a red telephone box
When I got there, she'd already rubbed it off
In the morning

Out of the dark and into the light
When the morning comes, I will be all right

And all this time I've watched it change
But it's still the same
In the morning
In the morning
In the morning
In the morning
