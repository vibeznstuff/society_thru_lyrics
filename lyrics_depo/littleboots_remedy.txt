I can see you stalking like a predator
I've been here before
Temptation calls like adam to the apple
But I will not be caught
Cos I can read those velvet eyes
And all I see is lies

No more poison, killing my emotion
I will not be frozen
Dancing is my remedy, remedy
I'll start stop praying
Cos I'm not playing
I'm not frozen
Dancing is my remedy, remedy

I'll move while you're watching me
Dance with the enemy
I've got a remedy, oh a oh a oh
Move while you're watching me
Dance with the enemy
Here is my remedy, oh a oh a oh

Spin me faster like a kaleidoscope
All I've got's the floor
Yeah you can try but I found the antidote
Music is the cure
So you can try to paralyze but I know best this time

No more poison, killing my emotion
I will not be frozen
Dancing is my remedy, remedy
I'll start stop praying
Cos I'm not playing
I'm not frozen
Dancing is my remedy, remedy

Move while you're watching me
Dance with the enemy
I've got a remedy, oh a oh a oh
Move while you're watching me
Dance with the enemy
Here is my remedy, oh a oh a oh

And when the music fades away
I know I'll be OK
Contagious rhythms in my brain
Let it play

No more poison, killing my emotion
I will not be frozen
Dancing is my remedy, remedy
I'll start stop praying
Cos I'm not playing
I'm not frozen
Dancing is my remedy, remedy

Move while you're watching me
Dance with the enemy
I've got a remedy, oh a oh a oh
Move while you're watching me
Dance with the enemy
Here is my remedy, oh a oh a oh

Move while you're watching me
Dance with the enemy
I've got a remedy, oh a oh a oh
Move while you're watching me
Dance with the enemy
Here is my remedy, oh a oh a oh
