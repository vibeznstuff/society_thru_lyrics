If I fell with no one around
Would it even make a sound?
Cause I can't even make one now
And I get these thoughts in my head
But I wouldn't do it anyway
Or at least that's what I say

Til I'm right on the edge
I take a look at the bottom
And I know it will hurt hitting ground
But I don't think that I'd mind the falling
Would anyone know? Is there anyone watching?
I'm getting crazy ideas in my head
And I don't think I'm able to stop them
Jump

When the water rushes in
I feel it filling up my lungs
I'm in the calm before the storm
When I dive, feel the wind in my hair
Nobody can talk me down
I'm really gonna do it now

I'm standing right on the edge
Looking down at the bottom
And I know it will hurt hitting ground
But I don't think that I'd mind the falling
Would anyone know? Is there anyone watching?
I'm getting crazy ideas in my head
And I'm not even trying to stop them
Jump

I'm standing right on the edge
Looking down at the bottom
And I know it will hurt hitting ground
But I don't think that I'd mind the falling
Would anyone know? Is there anyone watching?
I'm getting crazy ideas in my head
And I'm not even trying to stop them
