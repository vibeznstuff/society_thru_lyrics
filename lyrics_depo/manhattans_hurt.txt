(You made a promise,and you broke it, 
He could never love you like I do, 
oh I feel so bad)

Hurt, to think that you lied to me
hurt, way down deep inside of me
you said your love was true and we'd never part,
now you've found someone new,
and it breaks my heart,
I'm hurt,

Hurt, much more than you'll ever know,
hurt, because I still love you so,
but even though you hurt me,
like no-one else could do,
I would never, never hurt you

(Even though you've taken you love from me,
baby I want you back, I'll never hurt you)

I'll never hurt you....
