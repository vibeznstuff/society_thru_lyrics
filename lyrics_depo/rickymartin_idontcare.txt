I don’t care, I just wanna be yours
I know I told you I’d
Never love you the way that I did again
After all that you did to me
But I got to say

I don’t care, I just wanna be yours
And I am trying everything in my power
To never ever say
Please come back to me
But I got to say

Promised me
You’d always be
You’d never let me go
You took the ring and
All the things that came with being my girl

The tragedy as I walked through that door
you had your feet up over the seat
All I heard was screaming
It was just like a movie
Too real to be
That just can’t be my bride to be, no!

I was shocked this could be 
never thinking one day I'd take
This blow blow blow
I was starting to feel like
I should kill everything that was moving--whoa
Never been in hell like this
Somebody wake me up


I don’t care, I just wanna be yours
I know I told you I’d
Never love you the way that I did again
After all that you did to me
But I got to say

I don’t care, I just wanna be yours and
I am trying everything in my power
To never ever say
Please come back to me
But I got to say

Crazy boy was he just kept going 
Cause she was the only one that had noticed me
Staring into the eyes
That I will one day call my babe
How could I’ve fallen so in love
With someone I’d known for years
Not even know that
She’d be the one
To reveal my worst fears

It was just like a movie
Too real to be that just can't be my bride to be no
I was shocked this could be 
never thinking one day I'd take
This blow blow blow
I was starting to feel like
I should kill everything that was moving--whoa
Never been in hell like this
Somebody wake me up

I don’t care, I just wanna be yours
I know I told you I’d
Never love you the way that I did again
After all that you did to me
But I got to say

I don’t care, I just wanna be yours and
I am trying everything in my power
To never ever say
Please come back to me
But I got to say

I did'nt mean to do
All those things to you
Tell me what to do to make it up to you
I’ll do everything, anything that you want me to

I did'nt mean to do
All those things to you
Tell me what to do, oh, to make it up to you
I’ll do everything, anything that you want me to

Should I leave should I go
should I break apart
My mama said you would break my heart
I can’t believe you would sleaze you a slut a hoe
now you want to have a change of heart
Who’d have thought
That you would deceive me
Love of my life
You’re my queen like Evie
And you didn’t even tell me you leaving
I had to hear about it on Escandalo TV
now who's this man creeping in the back door
bout' to hit him with the fo fo fo
I know you keep saying that you loving me so
But why the hell you crushing him for, god damn now!

I don’t care that's what Ricky says
and if I catch him then he'll be dead
I don’t play that mommy
Now back to the jerk you go
I left your reeboks by the front door--kick rocks bitch.

I don’t care, I just wanna be yours
I know I told you I’d
Never love you the way that I did again
After all that you’ve been to me
But I got to say

I don’t care, I just wanna be yours and
I am trying everything in my power
To never ever say
Please come back to me
But I got to say

Sorry baby
