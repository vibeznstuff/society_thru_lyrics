I knew a girl and her name was Judy
She used to do things I thought were rude
But I never said anything to her face,
'Cuz my friends I thought she'd kick my arse all over the place.
Used to think she was kinda cool (kinda cool)
I saw her walking all around the school (around the school)
All the older boys would stop and turn their heads,
All the older girls wished that she was dead.

Judy, whatcha gonna do?
When you're older and no one wants to know ya?
I will look out for you,
If you will look out for me
I know I'm not as hard as you
But I think I can see right through you,

Now me and Judy we're the best of pals (best of pals),
She took me dancing to the early hours (early hours)
And showed me things I've never seen
Mum always asked me where I'd been
When I'm with,

Judy, whatcha gonna do?
When you're older and no one wants to know ya?
I will look out for you,
If you will look out for me
I know I'm not as hard as you
But I think I can see right through you,

When you go,
Home at night,
Are you still looking,
For a fight?
You know you're mum,
Is not that mean,
But still you want to,
Rip out her spleen.

Judy, whatcha gonna do?
When you're older and no one wants to know ya?
I will look out for you,
If you will look out for me
I know I'm not as hard as you
But I think I can see right through you,

Ooooh
Ooooh

What's in your head?
