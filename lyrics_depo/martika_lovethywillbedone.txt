Love... Thy will be done 
I can no longer hide, I can no longer run 
No longer can I resist Your guiding light 
That gives me the power to keep up the fight 

Oh Lord, Love... Thy will be done 
Since I have found U, my life has just begun 
And I see all of Your creations as one perfect complex 
No one less beautiful or more special than the next 
We are all blessed and so wise to accept 
Thy will, Love, be done 

Love... Thy will be mine 
And make me strive for the glorious and divine 
I could not be more, more satisfied (Satisfied) 
Even when there's no peace outside my window, there's peace inside 
And that why I no longer run (I no longer run) 
Love... Thy will be done 

Love... Thy will be done 
I can no longer hide, I can no longer run 
Oh Love... Thy will be done 
Thy will, Love, be done 

Oh, no longer can I resist (No) 
The guiding light (Guiding light) 
The light that gives me power to keep up the fight 
I couldn't be more satisfied (No) 
Even when there's no peace outside my window, there is peace inside 
And that's why I can no longer run 
Love, thy will be done
Love, thy will be done
Love, thy will be done
Oh! 

Love... Thy will be done 
I can no longer hide, I can no longer run 
Oh Love... Thy will be done 
Thy will, Love, be done 

Oh Love... Thy will be done 
I can no longer hide, I can no longer run 
Oh Love... Thy will be done (Sing it) 
Thy will, Love, be done (Glory, glory, glory) 
Thy will, Love, be done (Glory) 
Thy will, Love, be done
