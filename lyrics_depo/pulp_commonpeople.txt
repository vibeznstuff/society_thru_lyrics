She came from Greece, she had a thirst for knowledge
She studied sculpture at Saint Martin's College,
That's where I
Caught her eye. 

She told me that her dad was loaded
I said, "In that case I'll have a rum and coca-cola."
She said, "Fine,"
And in thirty seconds time
She said,

"I want to live like common people.
I want to do whatever common people do,
I want to sleep with common people
I want to sleep with common people like you."

Well, what else could I do? 
I said, "I'll see what I can do."

I took her to a supermarket
I don't know why but I had to start it
Somewhere,
So it started there. 

I said, "Pretend you've got no money,"
She just laughed and said, "Oh, you're so funny."
I said, "Yeah?
Well, I can't see anyone else smiling in here." 

Are you sure you want to live like common people?
You want to see whatever common people see
You want to sleep with common people, 
You want to sleep with common people like me. 

But she didn't understand,
She just smiled and held my hand. 

Rent a flat above a shop,
Cut your hair and get a job. 
Smoke some fags and play some pool,
Pretend you never went to school. 

But still you'll never get it right 
'Cause when you're laid in bed at night
Watching 'roaches climb the wall
If you called your dad he could stop it all. 

You'll never live like common people
You'll never do whatever common people do
You'll never fail like common people
You'll never watch your life slide out of view,
And dance and drink and screw 
Because there's nothing else to do. 

Sing along with the common people,
Sing along and it might just get you through
Laugh along with the common people
Laugh along even though they're laughing at you
And the stupid things that you do. 
Because you think that poor is cool. 

I want to live with common people like you,
I want to live with common people like you
