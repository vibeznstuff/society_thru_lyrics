Well they're selling another messiah
Here tonight
But we're all way too numb and divided
To buy it

Singing
No no no
We are all too divided this time
No no no

Show me a leader that won't compromise
Show me a leader so hope never dies
We need a hero this time
No no no

Disillusioned and tired of waiting
For the one
Whose intentions are pure unpersuaded
We can trust

Singing
No no no
'Cause a promise is never enough
No no no

Show me a leader that won't compromise
Show me a leader so hope never dies
We need a hero this time

I know, I know
I know if we're to survive
We need to know this is not the end
How will we ever get by
It's getting harder to fight out here on our own

Show me a leader that won't compromise
Show me a leader so hope never dies
Show me a leader that knows what is right
Show me a leader so hope can survive
We need a hero this time

No no no
We need a hero this time
Or we will never survive
No no no
We need a hero this time
Or we will never survive
