i miss you
but i haven't met you yet
so special
but it hasn't happened yet
you are gorgeous
but i haven't met you yet
i remember 
but it hasn't happened yet

and if you believe in dreams 
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i will meet you

i was peaking
but it hasn't happened yet
i haven't been given
my best souvenir
i miss you
but i haven't met you yet
i know your habits
but wouldn't recognize you yet

and if you believe in dreams 
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
i will meet you

i'm so impatient 
i can't stand the wait 
when will i get my cuddle?
who are you?

i know by now that you'll arrive
by the time i stop waiting

i miss you
