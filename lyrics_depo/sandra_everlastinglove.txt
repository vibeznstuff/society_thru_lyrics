You are my everlasting
You are my everlasting love

Hearts go astray
Leaving hurt when they go
You went away just when you needed me so
Finding your way
You come back on to me
I'm gonna stay loving you endlessly

Open up your eyes
Then you realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love
Need you by my side
There's no need to hide
Never be denied
Everlasting love
From the very start
Open up your heart
Be a lasting part of
Everlasting love

You are my everlasting
You are my everlasting love

Look in my eyes
See my love burning strong
No more goodbyes
In your arms I belong
Our time has come
All my dreams have come true
Two hearts as one
Loving me loving you.

Open up your eyes
Then you realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love
Need you by my side
There's no need to hide
Never be denied
Everlasting love
From the very start
Open up your heart
Be a lasting part of
Everlasting love

You are my everlasting
You are my everlasting love
You are my everlasting
You are my everlasting love

Open up your eyes
Then you realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love
Need you by my side
There's no need to hide
Never be denied
Everlasting love
From the very start
Open up your heart
Be a lasting part of
Everlasting love

Open up your eyes
Then you realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love
Need you by my side
There's no need to hide
Never be denied
Everlasting love
From the very start
Open up your heart
Be a lasting part of
Everlasting love
