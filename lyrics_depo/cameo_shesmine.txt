Look
Excuse me, sir, but I do believe
The lady arrived with me
Well

It's her style smile charm and poise
It's the past she attracts noise from the boys
They try to get in touch to rap those lines
But she's too smart to let them beat my time

She's mine
And I love it when she touches
Makes cold chills run down my spine
Mine
I don't know how she does it
But she gets her man everytime

Now she's not responsible
When you pass her
And she won't be around
When your money runs out
Cuz a love like hers han a mean punch
She eats guys like you everyday for lunch

Now the girl is sweet
She's not mean
But it's obvious though
That I'm handlin' fish
And if you wanna know
What this is all about
I'm tellin' you fellas there is no doubt

She's mine
I'm tryin' to make you realize she's
Mine
Don't come onto her with those goo goo eyes
Mine
As bittersweet as bittersweet can be
Mine
There's only one qualified and that's me

Now let me explain she's just like me
A professional person with a master's degree
From the school of hard knot fraternity
Alpha phi beta sigma

C.A.M.E.O.
The graduatin' class of Cameo
Talk to all my friends if I may say so
Let's all get up and go go you know

Can't you see see see my ID?

She's mine
Boys boys

Well I came up with one reason to rap the guys
And to spread the word to my fellow alumni
Let it be known that we're a positive group
With a taste for adventure an eye to you
So I hope I made it plain for you to see
My distinguished colieagues and their manters' degree
In the sovereign field of sociology
On the background of America we seem to see

Mine
To make you realize she's
Mine
Mine
Can't take the girl cuz she's
Mine
There's only one qualified and that's me
Hey hey

She's mine
Mine
Don't come onto her with those goo goo eyes
Mine
