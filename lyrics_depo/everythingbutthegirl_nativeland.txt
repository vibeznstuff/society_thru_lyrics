Stone the crows if you've done it again,
if I've told you once, told you a thousand times.
Sometimes I am so convinced we're casting pearl amongst the swine.

Don't ever let me hear you say this is the life we folks must lead.
We shun the limelight, shun the glare,
and the circus built on a bigot's creed.

Heaven is a place I've heard but we haven't been there yet, I fear.
We may have opened pearly gates but sometimes hell stills steals in here.

Don't ever let me hear you say this is the life we folks must lead.
Do you think silver turns our locks?
What gold do you think paves our streets?

You say we're in a different world now, 
where money and love go hand in hand.
But can't you see we share this town, 
so why should we fight on our native land?
Can't you see we share this town,
so why on earth should we tear it down?
