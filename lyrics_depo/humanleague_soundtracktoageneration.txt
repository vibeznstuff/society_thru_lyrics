The smell of trees
Can only be that way
On a sunny day
Floating through the open window
To the cool inside
Where we lay side by side
How can anything we feel
Ever mean so much
As a summer love
How can anything we need 
Ever get in touch
With the meaning of

A whole life waiting
Wishing suddenly
That it's gonna be the real thing
Or separating
Try your luck again
(It's just part of the adventure)

(Holy cow)
You do it to me now
The soundtrack to a generation
(Oh, wow)
You're getting to me now
The soundtrack to a generation

Another tune
Before the light has gone
And we'll be on our way
The sounds and smells
Will always linger on
They're in my heart today

We feel so lucky then
The world's a massive place
But we run into each other
Just one small happening
An accident of fate
Or the work of co-conspirators
But if we knew
What could it do to help us now

(Holy cow)
You do it to me now
The soundtrack to a generation
(Anyhow)
Just give it to me now
The soundtrack to a generation
(Oh, wow)
You really got me now
The soundtrack to a generation
(Holy cow)
You're getting to me now
The soundtrack to a generation

Years have gone on in between
But all I knew at seventeen
Is all I know now
Through times of joy and suffering
The music flavours everything
That's all I know now

(Holy cow)
You do it to me now
The soundtrack to a generation
(Oh, wow)
You really got me now
The soundtrack to a generation
(Anyhow)
Just give it to me now
The soundtrack to a generation

Just give it
You're getting
You do it
You really got me now
The soundtrack to a generation
(Oh, wow)
Just give it
You're getting
You do it
You really got me now
The soundtrack to a generation
(Oh, wow)
You really got me now
The soundtrack to a generation.
