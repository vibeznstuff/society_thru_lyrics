It's been so long
You say you've had fun
And you've been happy
With the things you've done
Now you feel strange and a little unreal
Well, I can understand
The way you feel
You're just a little in love
(Just a little)
You're just a little in love
(Just a little)

Well, I can see
What's happenin' to you
You feel alone
But it's just not true
And there's one thing
You ought to know
Whoooa-hooooo
I need you so
I'm just a little in love
(Just a little)
I'm just a little in love
(Just a little)

You say you're willin' to learn
You need a friend
A friend who will help you
'Cause you're just a little in love
Oh, yeah
A little in love
You are
A little in love
With someone you're just like to see
Like me, you're in love
Oh yeah, a little in love

You know sometime
You look somewhere
You're not alone
But there's no one there
No one to turn to
And no one to see
The way you're feelin'
You're just like me
You're just a little in love
(Just a little)
You're just a little in love
(Just a little)

Now, you say you're willin' to learn
You need a friend
A friend who will help you
'Cause you're just a little in love
Oh yeah, a little in love
You are
A little in love
With someone
You're just like to see
(You're just like me)
Like me, you're in love
Oh yeah, a little in love

Whoooooa-hoooooo
Ooooooooh, hoooooo

You're in love
Oh, yeah
A little in love
You are
A little in love
With someone
You're just like me
(You're just like me)
You're in love
Oh yeah, a little in love
You are
A little in love with someone
You're just like me
(With someone, you're just like me)
Oooooooooh
(You're just like me)
(You're in love)
Oooooh, you're in love, you're in love
You're in love
A little in love with someone....
