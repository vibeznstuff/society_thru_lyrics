Look at what you done then
Baby you hit me so hard

Don't know, how you did it
Loco, is how I'm feeling
Don't go, you're so addictive
I cannot resist it
Let's dance, let's take it to the next level
No hands, more bass and more treble
Tonight I wanna be a rebel, whoa
You got me so excited,
I'm doing things I've never done before
Done before, whoa
And when I try to fight it
I know it's something I cannot ignore
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know


Baby I don't know what you done, done, done
What you done, one done, hit a home run
Baby I don't know what you done, done, done
What you done, one done, hit a home run
I'm high now, I'm flying
I don't know what you did but
You hit me hard now I'm flying, all the night, yeah, yeah, yeah

Come show me how you move it
Fast, slow, control I'm loosing
This is my city, my cry
Got me locked, uh, yes...
So let's dance, let's take it to the next level
No hands, more bass and more treble
Tonight I wanna be a rebel, whoa
You got me so excited,
I'm doing things I've never done before
Done before, whoa
And when I try to fight it
I know it's something I cannot ignore
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know


Baby I don't know what you done, done, done
What you done, one done, hit a home run
Baby I don't know what you done, done, done
What you done, one done, hit a home run
I'm high now, I'm flying
I don't know what you did but
You hit me hard now I'm flying, all the night, yeah, yeah, yeah

Maybe run but you got me sprung up
All over my thing, like you're ready for the hang up, hang up
Ready to back my thing up,
Wait till you see more
Ying yang up,
Move to the left, take it back to the right, girl
 got my hands up, ready to back my thang up
Wait till you see my  hang up
You got me so excited,
I'm doing things I've never done before
Done before, whoa
And when I try to fight it
I know it's something I cannot ignore
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know


Baby I don't know what you done, done, done
What you done, one done, hit a home run
Baby I don't know what you done, done, done
What you done, one done, hit a home run
I'm high now, I'm flying

One time for you, you the baddest
One time for you, you the baddest
One time for you, you the baddest
Look at what you done, done
