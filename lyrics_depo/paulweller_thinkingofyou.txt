Everybody, let me tell you 'bout my love
Brought to me, by an angel from above
Full equipped with a lifetime guarantee
Once you try it, well I'm sure that you will be

Without love There's no reason to live
Without you what would I do with the love I give
All my lovin' To you I'll be giving
And I promise, as long as I'm living

I'm thinking of you and the things you do to me
That make me love you, now I'm living in ecstasy
I'm thinking of you and the things you do to me
That make me love you, now I'm living in ecstasy

All the times you make me glad that I'm alive
Sharing together, helping me survive
What did you think, brought the sun out today
Well it's you, let me hear you sing

Without love There's no reason to live
Without you what would I do with the love I give
All my lovin' To you I'll be giving
And I promise, as long as I'm living

I'm thinking of you and the things you do to me
That make me love you, now I'm living in ecstasy
I'm thinking of you and the things you do to me
That make me love you, now I'm living in ecstasy

Without love (and the things you do to me)
Without you (now I'm living in ecstasy)
I'm thinking of you and the things you do to me
That make me love you, now I'm living in ecstasy

Oh, I'm thinking of you-ou-ou
And the things you do to me
That make me love you, now I'm living in ecstasy
I'm thinking of you-ou-ou
And the things you do to me
That make me love you, now I'm living in ecstasy
I'm thinking of you
And the things you do to me
That make me love you, now I'm living in ecstasy
Oh, I'm thinking of you-ou-ou
And the things you do to me
That make me love you, now I'm living in ecstasy
I'm thinking of you-ou-ou
And the things you do to me
That make me love you, now I'm living in ecstasy
I'm thinking of you-ou-ou
And the things you do to me
That make me love you, now I'm living in ecstasy
