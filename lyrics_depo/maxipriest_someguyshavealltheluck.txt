Lonely, so lonely in your love
Oh so lonely, I'm saying

Alone in a crowd
On a bus after work
I'm day-dreaming

The guy next to me
Has his woman on his arm
My arms are empty

How does it feel
When the woman that you love
Says yes she loves you

It seems unfair
When there's love everywhere
And yet there's none for you

Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys have a little sunshine in their lives
My life is always filled with rain

Someone to take
On a walk down by the lake
Dear Lord let her be

Someone who shouts
Someone who is liable to cry
At sad movies

I do believe I will die
Just to look in your eyes
And find them filled with me

But you're just a dream
And as real as it seems
I'm not that lucky

Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys have a little sunshine in their lives
My life is always filled with rain

It's just a losing game
Things have got to change
Some girl will give my love a try
With my love their arms will open wide

Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys have a little sunshine in their lives
My life is always filled with rain
