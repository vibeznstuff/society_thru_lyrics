I remember walking around the streets at night
I remember people talking about their lives
One of us never made it home that night
Drunk and high got the better of her mind
Jenny died


The setting sun with music on
the restless day was gone
You can't see when thereÂ´s sun in your eyes
Your innocent
You think everything is possible
And nothings gonna get you baby
Everything is touchable
Nothings gonna beat you in this life
Its alright


Holding hands Drinking cans In the orange lights
Summer breeze Feeling free Kissing the first time
One of us never made it home that night
Easy love someone said give this stuff a try
Jenny tried


The railway bridge the river flowed
With shallow water down below
You can't see when thereÂ´s sun in your eyes
Your innocent
You think everything is possible
And nothings gonna get you baby
Everything is touchable
Nothings gonna beat you in this life
Its alright


the setting sun with music on
the restless day was gone
You can't see with the sun in your eyes
Your innocent

You think everything is possible
And nothings gonna get you baby
Everything is touchable
Nothings gonna beat you in this life
everything is possible
And nothings gonna get you baby
Everything is touchable
Nothings gonna beat you in this life
Its alright

Whoo hoo ho
