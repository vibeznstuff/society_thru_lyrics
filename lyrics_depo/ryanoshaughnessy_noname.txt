Every now and then I see a part of you I've never seen
Birds can swim and fish can fly
The road is long
No wonder why

One of these days you'll realize
What you mean to me
Ohh-hh, every now and then I see a part of you I've never seen

Every now and then I try to tell you just how I feel
Heavens talk, the rain begins, the sky turns black
Nobody wins
Well, I try to talk but I can't
My soul has turned to steel
This happens every now and then when I try to tell you just how I feel

So if you ever love somebody
You gotta' keep them close
When you lose grip of their body
You'll be falling
'Cause I'm falling
Deeper in love
In love 
In love
