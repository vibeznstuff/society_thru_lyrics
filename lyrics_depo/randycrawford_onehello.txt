If you're not afraid
Of what love brings
Then endings are beginnings
Of beautiful things
Its a chance you'll take 
It's a chance you'll win
If someone's gonna find you
First you gotta let them in

Coz love begins with one hello
The hardest part is over
Now its easy letting go
One hello is how it starts
You might win it all or lose your heart

If you're not afraid 
Of what you feel
Then try and keep it simple
Or try and keep it real
And if being real means 
Means you'll some day will say goodbye
Remember my friend
Goodbyes not the end
Its a circle you know 
And it starts with one hello

Love begins with one hello
The hardest part is over
Now it's easy letting go
One hello is how it starts
Remember my friend
Goodbyes not the end
Its a circle you know
And it starts with one hello
It starts with one hello
