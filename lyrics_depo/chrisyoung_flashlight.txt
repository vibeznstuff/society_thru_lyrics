He said: Son hold it still
Keep that beam shining straight
He has 9/16 in one hand, working on that Chevrolet
It seemed like every Saturday
Soon as the sun went down
We'd be huddled underneath that hood
Tinkerin' around
And of all the great memories I had
The best ones are those nights
Just me and my dad

He'll never know how much he taught me
Out in that garage
And I guess the stuff that stuck
More about life than fixing cars
Cause till this day
I still can't make them run right
But I sure did learn a lot
Just Holding the flashlight

He told me a lot of stories
About grandpa and the war
While he was trying to show me
What a carburetor is for
I've learned a couple of curse words
When he skinned his knuckles up
And I found out mama was the only girl
He ever really loved
But when I've asked him about women
He just laughed
If we stayed out here all year
We wouldn't have time enough for that

He'll never know how much he taught me
Out in that garage
And I guess the stuff that stuck
More about life than fixing cars
Cause till this day
I still can't make them run right
But I sure did learn a lot
Just Holding the flashlight

Now till this day
I still can't make them run right
But deep inside I know that's all right
Cause sure did learn a lot
Holding the flashlight
