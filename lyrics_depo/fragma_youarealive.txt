You're doing fine
Most of the time
You sit and wonder what tomorrow brings
All kinds of things
You sit and wait
You hesitate
Just like you never been in love before
There's so much more

On your own
And though you feel alone
You are alive
Don't you know it's just another day?
All alone
Into this world we're thrown
You are alive
Don't you know it's just another day?
On you own 
And though you feel alone
You are alive
Don't you know it's just another day?

You turn around
You're lost and found
Looking for someone who will understand
Or hold your hand
You count the days
A hopeless case
But for the first time you will wait for me
Patiently

On your own
And though you feel alone
You are alive
Don't you know it's just another day?
All alone
Into this world we're thrown
You are alive
Don't you know it's just another day?
On your own 
And though you feel alone
You are alive (You are alive)
Don't you know it's just another day?
On your own
And though you feel alone
You are alive (You are alive)
Don't you know it's just another day?
