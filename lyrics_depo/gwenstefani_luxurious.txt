(c'est pas possible cet amour, c'est incroyable.
Tu me fais transpirer, c'est parfait.)

Working so hard every night and day
And now we get the pay back
Trying so hard saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back

Champagne kisses hold me in your lap of luxury
I only want to fly first class desires, you're my limousine
So elegant the way we ride, our passion it just multiplies
There's platinum lightning in the sky
Look I'm livin' like a queen

This kind of love is getting expensive
We know how to live baby
We're luxurious like Egyptian cotton
We're so rich in love we're rollin' in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear baby
Diamond in the rough is looking so sparkly

Working so hard every night and day
And now we get the pay back
Trying so hard saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back

Sugar, honey, sexy baby
When we touch it turns to gold
Sensitive and delicate kinda like a tuberose
You know you are my treasure chest
It's pure perfection when we kiss and
You're my Mr.. I'm your Miss
Gonna be until we're old

Cha-ching cha-ching we're loaded and we're not gonna blow it
cha-ching cha-ching we're hooked up with the love cause we grow it
cha-ching cha-ching we got hydroponic love and we're smokin'
cha-ching cha-ching we burn it you and I, we are so lit

We're so rich in love were rollin' in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear baby
Diamond in the rough is lookin' so sparkly

Now we get to lay back

(Tu est si jolie c'est pas possible. C'est jamais assez... c'est jamais assez.
Tu me fais plein. Toutes les choses tu me fais sentir, c'est parfait.
Je suis bien avec toi... je suis bien.)
