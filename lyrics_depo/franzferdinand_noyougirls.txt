Oh, kiss me
Flick your cigarette, then kiss me
Kiss me where your eye won't meet me
Meet me where your mind won't kiss me

Flick your eyes and mine and then hit me
Hit me with your eyes so sweetly
Oh, you know you know you know that yes I love
I mean I'd love to get to know you

Do you never wonder?
No, no no no

You girls never know
Oh no, you girls'll never know
No you girls never know
How you make a boy feel
You girls never know
Oh no, you girls'll never know
No you girls never know
How you make a boy feel
How you make a boy

Oh, kiss me
Flick your cigarette, then kiss me
Kiss me where your eye won't meet me
Meet me where your eye won't lick me
Flick your mind and mine so briefly
Oh you know, you know you're so sweetly
Oh you know, you know that I know that I love you
I mean I, I mean I need to love

Do you never wonder?
No, no no no

You girls never know
Oh no, you girls'll never know
No you girls never know
How you make a boy feel
You girls never know
Oh no, you girls'll never know
No you girls never know
How you make a boy feel
How you make a boy feel
How you make a boy

Sometimes I say stupid things
That I think
Well, I mean I
Sometimes I think the stupidest things
Because I never wonder
Oh how the girl feels
Oh how the girl feels

No you boys never care
Oh no you boys'll never care
No you boys never care
How the girl feels
No you boys never care
You dirty boys'll never care
No you boys never care
How the girl feels

Oh how the girl feels
Oh how the girl feels
