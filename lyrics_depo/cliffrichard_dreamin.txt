Four o'clock I've been walkin' all night
It's the time I always think of you
If you could only see through my eyes
Then you'd know just what I'm going through

Here am I I'm taking a chance
In running around with stars in my eyes
Here am I I'm looking for you
Wondering why do I feel so blue

I'm dreamin' dreamin' of me and you
I'm dreamin' dreamin' will see me through
Never letting chances pass me by
I'm gonna dream you right into my life
Yeah dream you right into my life
(Dreamin' dreamin' will see me through)
Woman you'd better believe I'm
(Dreamin' you into my life)

Five o'clock still walking around
I call you up but you just bring me down
I guess you'd say I'm getting nowhere
But in my dreams you always come around
Here am I I'm takin' a chance
I'm walking on air flyin' so high
Here am I I'm facing the truth
There's no other way I'll ever make you mine
I'm dreamin'
Dreamin' of me and you
Dreamin' dreamin' will see me through
Never letting chances pass me by
I'm gonna dream you right into my life
(Dreamin' dreamin' will see me through)
Woman you'd better believe that I'll be
(Dreamin' you into my life)

Woman you've got to believe me woman
Oh woman you've got to believe me woman
I'll be (dreamin' you into my life)
You've got to believe me woman
Woman oh woman you've got to believe me I'll be forever
(Dreamin' you into my life) Oh woman you got to believe me
