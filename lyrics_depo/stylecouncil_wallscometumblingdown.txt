You don't have to take this crap
You don't have to sit back and relax
(You can actually try changing it)

I know we've always been taught to rely
Upon those in authority
But you never know until you try
How things just might be
(If we came together so strongly, yeah)

Are you gonna try to make this work
Or spend your days down in the dirt
You see things can change
Yes an' walls come tumbling down

(Governments crack and systems fall
'Cause unity is powerful)
Lights go out
Walls come tumbling down

Yes, they do
(Yes, they do)
Yes, they do
(Yes, they do)

The competition is a color TV
We're on still pause with the video machine
(That keep you slaves to the H.P., yeah)

Until the unity is threatened by
Those who have and who have not
Those who are with and those who are without
And dangle jobs like a donkey's carrot
(Until you don't know where you are)

Are you gonna get to realize
The class war's real, not mythologized
And like Jericho
Yes, the walls came tumbling down

(Governments crack and systems fall)
('Cause unity is powerful)
Lights go out
Walls come tumbling

(Down) You'll be too weak to fight it
(Down) 
(Down) Oh, will you deny it?

Are you gonna be threatened by
The public enemies number ten
Those who play the power game
They take the profits, you take the blame
(When they tell you there's no rise in pay)

Are you gonna try to make this work
Or spend your days down in the dirt
You see things can change
Walls come tumbling down

(Governments crack and systems fall)
('Cause unity is powerful)
Lights go out
Walls come tumbling down

(Governments crack and systems fall) Yes, they do
('Cause unity is powerful)
Lights go out
Walls come tumbling down

(Governments crack and systems fall)
('Cause unity is powerful)
Lights go out
Walls come tumbling down

(Governments crack and systems fall)
('Cause unity is powerful)
Oh, lights go out
Walls come tumbling down
