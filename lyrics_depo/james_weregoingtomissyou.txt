This is not, this is not a song
This is a shield, this is a charm with your name on
By this beat, by this verse I'm protected
From your heat and your curse is reflected
If anybody hurts me, if anybody hurts me

Here's a mirror with your name on
Singing, "We're gonna miss you when you're gone"
Here's a mirror with your name on
Singing, "We're gonna miss you when you're gone"

Your green eyes, poison pen, serpent's tongue
Will return to the source that they came from
Revenge is the wine, forgiveness is fine
Forgiveness divine, revenge is more human

Here's a mirror with your name on
Singing, "We're gonna miss you when you're gone"
Here's a mirror with your name on
Singing, "We're gonna miss you when you're gone"

No words, all's been said and done
No more words, all's been said and done

Here's a mirror with your name on
Singing, "We're gonna miss you when you're gone"
Here's a mirror with your name on
Singing, "We're gonna miss you when you're gone"

Here's a mirror with your name on
Singing, "We're gonna miss you when you're gone"
