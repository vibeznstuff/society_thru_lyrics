Hey ya
I came to talk about this girl that had my love it seems
I went away for a while
She gave my love away
I really shouldn't blame her
But now that pussy is a stranger


Baby, something's on my mind I gotta say it
Yeah, your pussy done changed
It ain't the same girl and that's a shame (a crying shame baby)
Oh, ain't being funny
I know another bee's been in that honey
Oh, baby, her pussy done changed
It's such a shame girl and that's a shame
(who the hell you giving my loving to, girl?)

Oh no
Tell me where that pussy gone
'Cause it don't feel the same
(I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy)
Oh No
(why you do me like that baby)
Oh No
Why is that happening to me?
Oh No
She told me that it was not missin'
(I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy)
Oh No
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

She, she used to be a really special lady (my everything)
I guess she's feeling kinda freaky lately
It's such a shame 'cause now the pussy's changed (pussy changed)
She used to squeeze me
Grip me tight and now so she can please me
But now, now that pussy changed
It's such a shame, that pussy changed

Oh no
Where did ya pussy go? (where's it at baby?)
Oh no
'Cause girl, I need to know (I need to know)
(I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy)
Oh no
You see, it was on some old one of a kind type shit baby
Oh no
I'ma about to kill this bitch
Oh no
She gave away all my shit
(I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy)
Oh no
Yeah, yeah, yeah


Damn, doll, do change ya all?
I'm your number fan belt they are not important
I don't use a cordless microphone, avoid them
They don't feel real to me
Meaning real woman
Others built on me
You the primer on the lime bean green box when I couldn't afford the Ford
Clean socks scootin' across the floor in your grandmama's house
Hand on your mouth
You yap too much about the Penny-Ante, this mechanic's so uncanny
X-men, X-men, your ex-boyfriend should thank me that I took you off his hands
No I can't bring another beach to the sand
And know I am well aware that you can bring a man to his knees
And get what you need without saying please
But can you bring a man to his feet when defeat is on repeat
And they put this man's Grammy's on the street?
What? Why so quiet?
Hate that all of our memories happened in a Hyatt
You were perfect before you went on a diet
You was way different, you think I don't remember
Shit, the magazine got to your head
Now somebody you don't even know got you in bed
Bet your buddy don't even know you don't like red
Or was it fuchsia, fuck it, our future is dead.


I thought a pussy cat had 9 lives man

Oh no
(I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy)
Oh no
I'ma about to kill this bitch
Oh no
She gave away all my shit
(I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy)
Oh no
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I miss ya girl

(Fuck that bitch!)
