Party people (hey)
It's Friday night
Rock this joint until the morning light
Crowd is jumping (hey)
It feels alright
Forget Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
(Hey) it's Friday night

Just another day
Sitting watching the clock
Tick tock, tick tock
But it feels like it's stopped
Wishing time away
Pushing Monday through to Friday

I'm dreaming of the crowds
Everybody's hanging out
The soft-top's down
And we're pumping the sounds
I can feel the vibe
As we're cruising the town
I can't wait 'til Friday comes around

Oh, when the working week is done (is done)
Got my money and now I'm gonna get some (get some)


Party people (hey) It's Friday night (Friday)
We'll rock this joint until the morning light
Crowd is jumping (hey)
It feels alright (alright)
Forget Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
(Hey) it's Friday night

(So y'all ready?
We just keep rockin' on
Feeling good
Just 'til the break of dawn)

Know what I gotta do
I'll do what they say
But I swear that ship is coming my way
Gonna kiss this place goodbye
Gonna chase my destiny
Gonna make it Friday every day

Ah, when the working week is done (is done)
Got my money and I'm gonna get some (get some)
Chorus
Party people (hey)
It's Friday night (gonna rock this joint)
We'll rock this joint until the morning light
(morning light)
Crowd is jumping (hey)
It feels alright (alright)
Forget Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
(Hey) it's Friday night (party people, yeah)

Party people (hey)
It's Friday night (gonna rock this joint)
Gonna rock this joint until the morning light
Crowd is jumping (hey)
It feels alright (alright)
Forget Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
(Hey) it's Friday night 

Bring, bring, telephone rings
Tell me baby what you're saying
I know sometimes it's hard to take it
Trust me baby, just believe it
Monday I know, it goes so slow
Tuesday man, I just don't know
Wednesdays drive you crazy
Thurdays over man, it's Friday


Party people (hey)
It's Friday night (friday)
Gonna rock this joint until the morning light
(morning light)
Crowd is jumping (hey)
It feels alright (alright)
Forget Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
(Hey) it's Friday night (party people, yeah)
