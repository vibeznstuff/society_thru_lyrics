Waitin' at a stop light yesterday
As a funeral procession made its way,
Through the gates.
I watched it roll up a winding road,
Through a field of green with white headstones,
All in a row.
And it made me think about where I'm at,
On my not so straight and narrow path...
All the generous and mostly undeserved,
Blessings that I've had.

I had an all-American Mom and Dad,
Some of the coolest friends you could ever have.
Found love I thought I'd never find...
Sometimes I can't believe this life is mine.
And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet,
But the truth is, you just never know,
An' if this is as good as it gets,
Man, I think I'm good to go,
I'm good to go.

I said a prayer for the dearly departed,
An, the loved ones left broken hearted,
Then traffic started.
An' I drove away a little more able,
To see the good things on my table,
And that I'm grateful.
'Cause I've had my troubles, I've had my trials;
I've hit the mark an' I've missed by miles.
Had days that I've been fightin' mad,
But the good times have more than outweighed the bad.

Got to hold my newborn baby girl,
And the hand of a man as he slipped from this world.
I've laughed so hard, I couldn't stop,
Seen the sunrise from a mountain top.
And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet,
But the truth is, you just never know,
An' if this is as good as it gets,
Man, I think I'm good to go.



Yeah, I've been thinkin' bout where I'm at,
On my not so straight and narrow path,
An' I wouldn't wanna change nothin' about,
This "roll with the punches" life I've had.

But the truth is, you just never know,
An' if this is as good as it gets,
Man, I think I'm good to go,
I'm good to go.
I'm good to go.
