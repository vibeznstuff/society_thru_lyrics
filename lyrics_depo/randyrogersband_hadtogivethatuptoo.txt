When I started drinking, it was gin
Just one or two every now then
Soon I didn't know when to say when
That's when it almost did me in
Kinda like you
I had to give that up too

I miss the taste, I miss the high
And the way it made me burn inside
But it knocked me down on my knees
When I loved it more than it loved me
Kinda like you
I had to give that up too

Finally off the cigarettes
Been 3 months I haven't lit one yet
I knew I had to put them down
Before they put me in the ground
Kinda like you
I had to give that up too

I miss the taste, I miss the high
And the way it made me burn inside
But it knocked me down on my knees
When I loved it more than it loved me
Kinda like you
I had to give that up too

Wish I could have just one or two
But that's just something I just can't do
So I've made my peace with what I am
There's just some things I just can't have
Kinda like you
I had to give that up too
