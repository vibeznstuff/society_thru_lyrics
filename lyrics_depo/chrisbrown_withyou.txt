And the heart's all over the world tonight,
Said the heart's all over the world tonight


Hey! Little mama,
Ooh, you're a stunner
Hot little figure,
Yes, you're a winner
And I'm so glad to be yours,
You're a class all your own
And
Oh, little cutie
When you talk to me
I swear the whole world stops
You're my sweetheart
And I'm so glad that you're mine
You are one of a kind and...


You mean to me
What I mean to you and
Together baby,
There is nothing we won't do.
'Cause if I got you,
I don't need money,
I don't need cars,
Girl, you're my all.
And...


Oh!
I'm into you,
And girl,
No one else would do.
'Cause with every kiss and every hug
You make me fall in love.
And now I know I can't be the only one,
I bet there heart's all over the world tonight,
With the love of their life who feels
What I feel when I'm...

With you 
Girl.
With you 


Oh girl!
I don't want nobody else.
Without you, there's no one left and
You're like Jordans on Saturday,
I gotta have you and I cannot wait now,
Hey! Little shawty,
Say you care for me,
You know I care for you,
You know that I'll be true,
You know that I won't lie,
You know that I would try,
To be your everything, yeah.


'Cause if I got you,
I don't need money,
I don't need cars,
Girl, you're my all.
And...



With you 
Oh.
With you 
Yeah heh.


And I
Will never try to deny,
that you're my whole life,
'Cause if you ever let me go,
I would die.
So I won't front.
I don't need another woman,
I just need your all and nothing,
'Cause if I got that,
Then I'll be straight
Baby, you're the best part of my day

And the heart's all over the world tonight,
Said the heart's all over the world tonight

Said the heart's all over the world tonight,
Heart's all over the world tonight
