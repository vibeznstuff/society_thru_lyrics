There's a picture in my wallet
I dare not speak her name
There's a letter with it on it
Washed out by the rain
And I wonder where I'm going
'Cause every day's the same
And it's summer in the suburbs
And I'm not sleeping

Tuning in on frequencies
That people leave without thinking 
On mobile phones and radios
I'll get there in the morning

Keeping me up all night, Baby do you feel alright?
Keeping me up all night, I long for the morning light
Keeping me up all night, Baby do you feel alright?
Keeping me up all night...
It's five in the morning
(I'm out of my head and that's not right)
(I can't get you out of my mind)

I've been walking out of myself
Random out of phase
I've been talking to a stranger
I haven't seen for days
I've been smashing up computers
'Cause I can't play their games
And I suffer from confusion
I can't remember

Names to all the faces
From the places I've been going lately
I've been searching, can't stop searching
It's gonna drive me crazy...

Keeping me up all night, Baby do you feel alright?
Keeping me up all night, I long for the morning light
Keeping me up all night, Baby do you feel alright?
Keeping me up all night...
It's five in the morning
(I'm out of my head and that's not right)
(I can't get you out of my mind)



Keeping me up all night, Baby do you feel alright?
Keeping me up all night, I long for the morning light
Keeping me up all night, Baby do you feel alright?
Keeping me up all night, I long for the morning light
Keeping me up all night, Baby do you feel alright?
Keeping me up all night...
It's five in the morning and nothing seems right
It's five in the morning
I can't get you out of my mind
