Ooh, uh-huh, yeah

Something 'bout your friends are always there for you
Help you with your bedtime and they'll see you through
Being with a man is never quite the same
Cos we just have some fun and really play the game

I don't know where will go
But I know we're gonna start the show

Girls are on the town tonight
Nothing can stop us
You can see it in her eyes
That we're not gonna sleep tonight
We're gonna get down tonight
See if we can make you blush
We can be mysterious
And we're not gonna sleep tonight

Tonight, we're not gonna sleep, yeah

We will find the time to party all night long
Now that we're together we just can't go wrong
Dancing in the street and making lots of noise
People wanna join us, especially the boys

There's no way, it's just the girls
For tonight, we're in our own world

Girls are on the town tonight
Nothing can stop us
You can see it in her eyes
That we're not gonna sleep tonight
We're gonna get down tonight
See if we can make you blush
We can be mysterious
And we're not gonna sleep tonight

(We're not gonna sleep)
