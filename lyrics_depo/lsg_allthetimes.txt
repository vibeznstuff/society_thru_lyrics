Sincerely I can say, yeah
That we should have met before today
But I am happy to have this chance
To be with you and I'm gonna make the best of it


This is more than joy for me
To feel like a family
And when we go our separate ways
This feeling will always stay

Look how long we've been around each other
And we've finally found the chance to get together
Look at all the times we've seen each other
It feels so good to be together

Look how long we've been around each other
And we've finally found the chance to get together


If you take a listen deeply, deeply
You can hear the pride in my voice, yeah, ohh
It's nothing hard to see that
I'm happy about the way we came to be, be


If I ever get the chance
Again I'll know that
We make sweet music together

Look how long we've been around each other
And we've finally got the chance to get together
Look at all the times we've seen each other
It feels so good to be together

Look how long we've been around each other
And we've finally got the chance to get together
Look at all the times we've seen each other
It feels so good to be together


Time is precious
We must take advantage
Especially when we're often apart


Baby, when you see
See me looking proud
I'm only thinking of me and you

Me and you, me and you, babe
I'm only thinking of me and you, me and you
I'm thinking of me and you

Look at the times we've been around
Now I have got the chance to be with you
Look at the times we've been around
Now I have got the chance to be with you

Look how long we've been around each other
And we've finally found a chance to get together
