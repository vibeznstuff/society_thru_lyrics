stars leave the morning
sleep clouds my view
Don't let them come round here
And call to you
I didn't notice
It's a crime too few
I didn't notice
It's a crime to fear

I tried to sleep alone
But I couldn't do it
You could be sitting next to me
I wouldn't know it
If I told you you were wrong
I don't remember saying it
I don't remember saying it

I'll be a shadow
In the cedar room
leave just a memory
Alone with you
I didn't see that
It's a call too soon
I couldn't see that
It's a call to you

And I tried to sleep alone
But I couldn't do it
You could be sitting next to me
And I wouldn't know it
If I told you you were wrong
I don't remember saying it
I don't remember saying it

The cedar room
The cedar room
The cedar room
