Something's tearing me down
And I can't help but feel it's coming from you
She's a gunshot bride
And her trigger cries
I just wonder what we've gotten ourselves into

In a trail of fire I know we will be free again
In the end we will be one
In a trail of fire I'll burn before you bury me
Set your sights for the sun

Mind is willing
Soul remains
This woman cannot be saved
From the draw into the fire

Mind is willing
Soul remains
This woman cannot be saved
From the draw into the fire
Anything to

Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home

Much too weak to jump yourself
Heal the wounds or crack the shell
Lift yourself from what's below

Much too weak to jump yourself
Heal the wounds or crack the shell
Lift yourself from what's below
Raise the anchor

Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home

In a trail of fire I know we will be free again
In the end we will be one
In a trail of fire I'll burn before you bury me
Set your sights for the sun

Bring it on home
