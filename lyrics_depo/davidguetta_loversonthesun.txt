Let's light it up let's light it up
Until our hearts catch fire
Then show the world a burning light
That never shined so bright
We'll find way
We'll find a way to keep the cold night
From breaking in over the walls
Onto the wild side
The hunger satisfied

We're burnin' up

We might as well be lovers on the sun oh oh oh oh
We might as well be lovers on the sun oh oh oh oh
We might as well be lovers on the sun


We'll never know
We'll never know what stands behind the door
But I got a feeling and it's a feeling
That it's worth dying for
Just close your eyes and hold your breath
Because it feels right
We'll keep it moving
Until we make it to the other side
And let's enjoy the ride

We're burnin' up

We might as well be lovers on the sun oh oh oh oh
We might as well be lovers on the sun oh oh oh oh
We might as well be lovers on the sun

Let's light it up let's light it up
Until our hearts catch fire
Then show the world a burning light
That never shined so bright
