You have a face for the radio,
But I know you'd like to see it in a show,
Claiming to be the next best everything,
Which way will you go?

You're a little smarter than most of us,
You run so fast sometimes it's hard to see you for dust,
Finding some time for you, it tortures me,
Which way will you go?

Wages on a Friday,
Spent on a Saturday,
Lend me a fiver,
Won't do that again,
Oh your trust is not to strong.

Your arrogance in a bag,
Won't spare you a fag,
Superstar wannabe,
Says it comes naturally,
Cemented in your own feeble way,

He watches trainspotting, fifteen times a week,
Thinking it's making him oh so unique,
PC on summer nights and football in the rain,
Doesn't matter how far he is,
He always has money for the train,

Nothing against you, love in my heart,
You're really a nice lad, I've known it from the start,
Your conscience in eager, to know where you lie,
Pushing your limits, give it up and remember you can cry.

Wages on a Friday,
Spent on a Saturday,
Lend me a tenner,
Won't do that again,
Oh your trust is not to strong.

You're arrogance in a bag,
Won't spare you a fag,
Superstar wannabe,
Says it comes naturally,
In your own feeble way.
