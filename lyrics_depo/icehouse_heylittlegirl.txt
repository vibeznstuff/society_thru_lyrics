Hey, hey
When everything goes wrong
Sometimes it makes no sense

Hey, hey
There once was a time
I should have known better then
Hey, hey
Although you may try
It won't come your way again

Hey, little girl
Where will you hide
Who can you run to now
Hey, little girl
Where will you go
Who can you turn to now

Hey, hey
So why should I care
If somebody let you down
Hey, hey
That's nothing new
I know just what that can mean

Hey, hey
Well, the way that they talk
The talk is all over town
Hey, hey
And it's no surprise
Little girls hurt sometimes

Hey, little girl
Where will you hide
Who can you run to now
Hey, little girl
Where will you go
Who can you turn to now

Hey, hey
When everything goes wrong
Sometimes it makes no sense
Hey, hey
Hey, little girl
I should have known better
Known better then

Hey, hey
Hey, little girl
Where will you hide
Who can you run to now
Hey, little girl
Where will you hide
Who can you run to now
Hey, little girl
Where will you go
Who can you turn to now
