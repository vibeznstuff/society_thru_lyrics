Come see me in the mornin'
Can't you see I'm tellin' stories
My sweet angel's everlasting true love ways
I'll wait I sow the seed
I set the scene and
I watch the world go by

See me go thru' changes
Revelations to blank pages
I'll find a brighter guide to see me thru'
And leaves fall to the ground
Turn to brown through the day just like you

Live for the day
I see your heart is empty I've got plenty
Joe come ride with me
I see your head is meant to be cemented
It's true
When the stories that you tell come back to haunt you

I'll be there in the mornin'
Can't you see I'm tellin' stories
My sweet angel's everlasting true love ways
While others turn to others
Introduce you and walk right on thru'

It's just about knowing where you come from
Being you and singing Love songs
Can begin to fill your day
I could lead you to the top don't stop
I could lead you there still

Live for the day
I see your heart is empty I've got plenty
Joe come ride with me
I see your head is meant to be cemented
It's true
When the stories that you tell come back to haunt you
