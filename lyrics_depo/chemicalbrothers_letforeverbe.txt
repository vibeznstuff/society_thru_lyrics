How does it feel like,
to wake up in the sun?
How does it feel like,
to shine on everyone?
How does it feel like,
to let forever be?
How does it feel like,
to spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter?

Scream a symphony.

How does it feel like,
to sail in on the breeze?
How does it feel like,
to spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter?

Scream a symphony.

How does it feel like, 
to make it happen here?
How does it feel like,
to breathe with everything?
How does it feel like,
to let forever be?
How does it feel like,
to spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter?

Scream a symphony.

How does it feel like,
to be a crystal fiend?
How does it feel like,
to spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter? 

Scream a symphony.
