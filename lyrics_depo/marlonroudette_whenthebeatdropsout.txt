When the beat drops out
And the people gone
We still be there, still be there
For me child

And When the lights go out
And the morning come
We still be there, still be there
For me child

When the beat drops out...

Life, happens when you're making plans
Flying high and shaking hands
The song will write you, you don't write it
I, didn't mean to fall in love
This rhythm that created us
I was running, we collided

Baseline, I will always make time,
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart for me
Baseline, after all the great times,
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart...

When the beat drops out
And the people gone
We still be there, still be there
For me child

When the lights go out
And the morning come
We still be there, still be there
For me child

When the beat drops out
And the people gone
We still be there, still be there
For me child

When the lights go out
And the morning come
We still be there, still be there
For me child

When the beat drops out...

With you, I found a new way to live
I see an alternative
Now we started, we can't stop it
I, I didn't mean to fall in love
Last thing I was thinking of
Was you and me but, we collided

Baseline, I will always make time,
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart for me
Baseline, after all the great times,
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart...

When the beat drops out
And the people gone
We still be there, still be there
For me child

When the lights go out
And the morning come
We still be there, still be there
For me child

When the beat drops out
And the people gone
We still be there, still be there
For me child. (we still be there for me)

When the lights go out (when the lights go out)
And the morning come (morning come)
We still be there, still be there
For me child (we still be there for me)

When the beat drops out...
When the beat drops out...
When the beat drops out...
