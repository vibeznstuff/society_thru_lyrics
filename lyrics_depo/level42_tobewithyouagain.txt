I've been making moves in chains
Wrapped around my hollow heart the thought of you remains
I can't replace your face no matter how I try
And in the night I cry from wanting you

You know I thought I could not lose
America was calling me you said I must choose
Between a life of love or visions that will fade
And now the choice is made I'm so lonely

Can you feel me reaching out to you?
I'm so lonely, are you lonely too?
I would give anything to make you understand
That I would go anywhere to be with you again

Heaven help me if you can
I remember better days, now I understand
You can't buy happiness, love is not for sale
The night is turning pale and I'm needing you
I've tried to talk the time away (but the time is here to stay)
Empty ears aren't listening
To one word I say (time to play)
The dream became a big machine out of control
And here inside my soul, I'm so lonely

Where are you now when I need you so?
I'm so lonely, I need you to know
I would give anything to make you understand
And I would go anywhere to be with you again

I was standing in the rain
I need to be with you again, yeah, baby

Can you feel me reaching out to you?
I'm so lonely, are you lonely too?
Where are you now, now I need you so?
I'm so lonely, I need you to know
I would give anything to make you understand
And I would go anywhere to be with you again, be with you again
