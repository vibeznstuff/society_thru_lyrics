I was walking to my baby's house late tonight
(I was walking, late tonight)
And when I got there the shades were all drawn tight
(the shades were all drawn tight)
And then I saw two shadows appear,
And all the rain seemed to turn to tears
And I'll never forget, this night in the rain
When I saw two silhouettes

Then the shadowed lips seemed to say I love you
(seemed to say I love you)
And it looked to me that they said the same thing too
(Liked they said the same thing too)
I never thought that I could cry
But it's the rain just a falling from my eyes
And I'll never forget, this night in the rain
When I saw two silhouettes (two silhouettes)

Two silhouettes on the window shade
Has caused each dream I had to fade
I started walking up to your door
Turned around,(turned around)
What's the use, (what's the use)
You don't love me anymore

Then I saw the two shadows kissing tenderly
(Saw them kissing tenderly)
I couldn't bare watching you kissing him
Instead of me (kissing him instead of me)
As I wandered on through the rain
I don't think I'll ever be the same
And I'll never forget, this night in the rain
When I saw two silhouettes
