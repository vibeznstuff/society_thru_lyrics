I can't let her go, I can't let her go 
Cause I need the love she gives to me 
I can't let her go, I can't let her go 
And she knows that we were meant to be 

First time I saw her 
Thought that I would lose my mind 
Just had to have her 
I had to have her (all mine) 

The way you make me feel 
Is like no other feeling I ever had before 
You give me the kind of lovin' 
Make a brother wanna come for more 
She's the one I adore 



Just can't believe it 
She's got me open all the time 
She knows I'm never leavin' 
Can't be wrong 
Cause it feels so right 

The way you make me feel 
Is like no other feeling I ever had before 
You give me the kind of lovin' 
Make a brother wanna come for more 
She's the one I adore 



No one can do what you do 
When you do what you do to me 
And I can't believe 
Can it be that it's me 
That you're feelin' 
It's ecstasy 



No one can do what you do 
When you do what you do to me 
And I can't believe 
Can it be that it's me 
That you're feelin' 
It's ecstasy
