She loves me and I know she wants me oh oh yeah
She loves me yeah and I know she cares about me
Friends they keep on telling me
How she sits and talks about me
Folks they keep on telling me yeah
How she always talks about me

Oh I've been such a fool
Not to realize the love we had
Gonna take this chance to prove to myself
Love is not a game
You and I should feel the same

Cause I recognize the woman in you 
Cause I recognize the woman in you 

Let love free me and break these chains that bind me
It's taking me time to see it
The loving that surrounds me
I've been down on my luck before
See oh Lord I can't take no more of this pain
Now I know it's gonna be alright
Cause with you I see the light
It's this way

Cause I recognize the woman in you 
Cause I recognize the woman in you 

In the corners of my mind
I can hear the voice of love
It talks about you
There's a place within my heart
Leaves me longing for the night
To vibe with you

Cause I recognize the woman in you 
Cause I recognize the woman in you 

I can feel the woman, woman in you, feel woman in you
I recognize the woman in you
I can feel the woman
