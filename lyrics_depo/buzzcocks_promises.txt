Ah loving you is easy you are on my side
We play the game strictly to our rules
We led the field a love affair
Which made all other lovers fools

Oh
How can you ever let me down
How can you ever let me down
How can you ever let me down
These promises are made for us

We promised that we'd always have time for each other
Whenever I needed you'd be there
We promised to be true there'd be no other
We promised that for ever we would care

Oh
How can you ever let me down
How can you ever let me down
How can you ever let me down
These promises are made for us

We had to change
But you stayed the same
You wouldn't change
Oh what a shame

Cos loving you's not easy you're not on my side
We play a game with two sets of rules
We lead the field in a love affair
Ah strictly meant for fools

Oh
Why did you ever let me down
Why did you ever let me down
Why did you ever let me down
Those promises were made for us

You never have any time for me
Whenever I need you you're not there
You've never been true and it's plain to see
The fact is you never really cared

Oh
Why did you ever let me down
Why did you ever let me down
Why did you ever let me down
Those promises we made for us
