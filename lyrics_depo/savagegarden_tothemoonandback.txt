She's taking her time making up 
the reasons 
To justify all the hurt inside 
Guess she knows from the smile 
and the look in their eyes 
Everyone's got a theory about the 
bitter one 
They're saying, "Mamma never loved 
her much" 
And, "Daddy never keeps in touch 
That's why she shies away from 
human affection" 
But somewhere in a private place 
She packs her bags for outer space 
And now she's waiting for the right 
kind of pilot to come 
And she'll say to him 
She's saying 

 
I would fly to the moon &amp; back if 
you'll be... 
If you'll be my baby 
Got a ticket for a world where we 
belong 
So would you be my baby? 

She can't remember a time when she 
felt needed 
If love was red then she was colour 
blind 
All her friends they've been tried for 
treason 
And crimes that were never defined 
She's saying, "Love is like a barren 
place, 
And reaching out for human faith is 
Is like a journey I just don't have a 
map for" 
So baby's gonna take a dive and 
Push the shift to overdrive 
Send a signal that she's hanging 
All her hopes on the stars 
What a pleasant dream 
Just saying 



(hold on... hold on...) 

Mamma never loved her much 
And Daddy never keeps in touch 
That's why she shies away from 
human affection 
But somewhere in a private place 
She packs her bags for outer space 
And now she's waiting for the right 
kind of pilot to come 
And she'll say to him 
Just saying
