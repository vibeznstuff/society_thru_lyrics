I can remember when we had, we had it all
You and I, You and I
You know, you know we had it all
You and I
Reminisce


I know that we've been here before
The candle light and you walking softly through my door
Come on in my sweet. How have you been?
Your so nice but tonight we're gonna be more than just friends
I recall the days and ways of love we made
I still feel the heat when we shared each other
Don't you feel the magic, the mystery's in the air
Lets go down to lover's lane with the love we shared


Let's make the time tonight while the feelings right
Reminisce on the love we had
Let's make the time tonight while the feelings right
Reminisce on the love we had


I can see you standing there alone
like an angel tryin' to find his way home
I don't remember how we fell apart
Here we are again, c'mon, right into my heart
I recall the days in ways of love we made
I still feel the heat when we shared each other
don't you feel the magic, the mystery's in the air
Let's go down to lover's lane with the love we shared



Make the time tonight, the feeling's oh so right
Reminisce on the love we had
Make the time tonight
Make the time tonight, the feeling's oh so right
Reminisce on the love we had
