You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you girl
We couldn't get much higher

Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

Oh, the time to hesitate is through
There's no time to wallow in the mire
If I was to say to you
That our love becomes a funeral pyre

Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh oh
Mmmm, yeah
Oh oh

Light my fire
Light my fire yeah yeah
Mmmm, yeah

The time to hesitate is through
There's no time to wallow in the mire
Try now we can only lose
And our love becomes a funeral pyre

Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Yeah

Come on baby light, light my fire
Light my fire, light my fire, light my fire
