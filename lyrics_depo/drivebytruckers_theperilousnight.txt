We needed warming from the cold hard facts
Unheeded warnings bout the broken tracks
All hope is fading and it's not coming back again

Uniting forces may be calling fast
Changing courses to some Stalin past
Melting faces through the looking glass, my friend

Something's got a hold of our feel alright
Out of control in the appetite
We're moving into the perilous night, Amen
Amen

Dumb, white and angry with their cup half filled
Running over people down in Charlottesville
White House Fury, it's the killing side, he defends

Defend the up-ender, yes he played that tune
Is ain't the ending but it's coming soon
We're making love beneath a sputnik moon again

White House is glowing from the Red Square light
The gates at the border being slammed down tight
We're moving into the perilous night, my friend

Something's got a hold of our feel alright
Out of control in the appetite
We're moving into the perilous night, Amen
Amen

And why's that drone looking through my window?
World keeps turning in the torch light shadow
Fourth Reich in khakis is beckoning
Both ends burning to the reckoning

Ronnie Reagan must be spinning his grave
Putin's on the rise, Ukraine's under siege
Fascism's knocking and Trump says "Let them in"

I'd like to tell you there'll be better days
But optimism's running low today
We're off the deep end with a lifeguard that can't swim

The Klan and the Nazis are taking up the fight
Against their own salvation in the saviors light
We're moving into the perilous night, Amen

Flags of oppression are blocking out the light
Dismantling The Greatest Generation's fight
We're moving into the perilous night, Amen
Amen
Amen
