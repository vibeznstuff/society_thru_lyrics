Don't cry baby
If this makes you cry, girl I didn't mean it
Next time I should lie, the truth is inconvenient
I bet if you'd try, you could live without me
I really don't know why, you bother to cry about me

Cry, cry, cry baby, I guess that I'm a bad guy now
Cry, cry, cry baby, just like all the other ones
Cry, cry, cry baby

I hate to see you cry, sad to say I've seen it
We should say goodbye and this time really mean it
Once some time goes by, I'm sure that you'll feel better
But if she needs to cry, then maybe I should let her 

Cry, cry, cry baby, I guess that I'm a bad guy now
Cry, cry, cry baby, just like all the other ones
Cry, cry, cry baby

Help me cry away, yeah
What more can I say to you
Cry, cry, cry baby, I guess that I'm a bad guy now
Cry, cry, cry baby, just like all the other ones

Cry, cry baby, feel the wall around your heart 
Cry, cry baby, baby, oh, oh, oh, just like all the other ones
Oh, oh, oh, just like all the other ones
Cry, cry, cry baby, 
I wanna see you cry baby, cry baby

Don't cry baby.
