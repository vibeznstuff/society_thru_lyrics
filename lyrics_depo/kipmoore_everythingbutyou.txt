I Bet you're wonderin' where I've been
What town I'm calling home for now
And just how long I'll be there before I turn around

Truth is I've finally found the place
Where I can start to plant some roots
It's about as close to being perfect, it's got everything but you

Theres a pathway to the ocean, a salty breeze blowing
And this old man down the street makes damn good wine
it's got stars that shine like diamonds on the black canvas behind 'em
And there's a sun out here that seems to always shine
And I've never seen water quite so blue
It's got everything but you

There's a taco stand right down the corner
serves the best cold draft beer
Sometimes I order up a round, pretend you're right here

An a reggae band plays every Friday
We drink and dance into the night
Most Folks 'round here think I'm a local and
I'd say that that's about right, yeah, that's about right

Theres a pathway to the ocean, a salty breeze blowing
And this old man down the street makes damn good wine
it's got stars that shine like diamonds on the black canvas behind 'em
And there's a sun out here that seems to always shine
And I've never seen water quite so blue
It's got everything but you

And that's everything to me
You, the only thing I need, yeah

Theres a pathway to the ocean, a salty breeze blowing
And this old man down the street makes damn good wine
And I've never seen water quite so blue
No, I ain't never seen water quite so blue
It's got everything but you, yeah
