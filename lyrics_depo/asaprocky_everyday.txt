Everyday I spend my time
Drinking wine, feeling fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand
Yes I am


So everyday I spend my time
Drinking wine, feeling fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow


Off again did he go
To another dimension my mind
Body, soul imprisoned my eye
Probably going ballistic but listen
I'm missing a couple of screws
They ain't never do dreaming true, you been sipping away at the truth
But besides the wisdom I do-do-do
Rolling do, hitting switches, rolling ditches, blowing kisses
To the bitches, hold the biscuits, what's the business
Beat the system, cold defendants
Blow the symptoms, go to prison
Go to church and pray to father Lord forgive us
And only God can judge me
And he don't like no ugly
I look so fucking good most dykes'll fuck me buddy
Yeah I'm a piece of shit
I know I plead the fifth
I tell her holla if ya need some dick
The devotion its getting hopeless
Behold it I'm getting closest
My soul is I'm seeing ghosts
A solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions
Adjusting to the motions
And getting out all my emotions


Everyday I spend my time
Drinking wine, feeling fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand
Yes I am


So everyday I spend my time
Drinking wine, feeling fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow


This type of shit make a nigga wanna flip September through August
This type of shit got em busting off the clip in the middle of the office
And a message to the bosses
The Misfits new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes, keep the saying that they cost it
For the Porsche's get em nauseous
Plus I ain't even mad yet, niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Wanna show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new rag
That's good news
Hood dudes usually don't look like you
How I'm finna get a deal and come back and the whole hood look like you
Screaming "Pimp Squad, hold it down!"
Can't drive, bitch I'm legally blind bitch
If I leave or die, it's up to me to decide
Shit niggas copping guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive in getting a piece of the pie
Is to agree with them a lot or just believe a facade bitch
And I'll be fine just drinking my wine bitch


I got the love birds chirpin' out the window
But I don't need love no mo
I'll be fine
Sipping wine
Taking time slowly


Everyday I spend my time
Drinking wine, feeling fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand
Yes I am


Everyday I spend my time drinking wine
Feeling fine
Waiting here to find the sign
I don't care if I ever know

I got the love birds chirpin' out the window
But I don't need love no mo
I'll be fine
Sipping wine
Taking time slowly
