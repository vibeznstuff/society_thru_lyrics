You can call me 4 in the morning, I'll give you what you need
Yeah, 4 in the morning, everyone's 'bout to leave
I usually don't give in so damn easily
But you hit bottoms, hit them like no other

You give me feels, you give me feels, yeah
Something that's real, I wanna let you know that

You can call me, oh, if you're lonely and you need somebody
You can call me, middle of the night when you need my body
You can call me, you can call me, you know that you can tell everyone
If you want me the way I want you, got my number, you know what to do, yeah

Dreamin' 'bout you, 4 in the morning, you put me in the mood
Yeah, 4 in the morning, I'm smoking on the roof
We are young, baby, so it's the night we can rendezvous
'Cause you hit bottoms, hit them like no other

You give me feels, you give me feels, yeah
Something that's real, I wanna let you know that

You can call me, oh, if you're lonely and you need somebody
You can call me, middle of the night when you need my body
You can call me, you can call me, you know that you can tell everyone
If you want me the way I want you, got my number, you know what to do, yeah

It's a beautiful night, got a view tellin' me for two
If you don't hit me up soon, it's likely that I call you
We are young, baby, so it's the night we can rendezvous
'Cause you hit bottoms, hit them like no other

You can call me, oh, if you're lonely and you need somebody
You can call me, middle of the night when you need my body
You can call me, you can call me, you know that you can tell everyone
If you want me the way I want you, got my number, you know what to do, yeah
