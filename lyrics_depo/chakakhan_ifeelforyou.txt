Let me tell you what I wanna do
I wanna love you
Wanna hug you
Wanna squeeze you too
Let me take you in my arms
Let me fill you with my charms
Chaka
'Cause you know that I'm the one
To keep you warm, Chaka
I'll make it more than just a physical dream
I wanna rock you, Chaka, baby
'Cuz you make me wanna scream
Let me rock you
Rock you

Baby, baby when I look at you
I get a warm feelin' inside
There's something 'bout the things you do
That keeps me satisfied

I wouldn't lie to you, baby
It's mainly a physical thing
This feeling that I got for you, baby
Makes me wanna sing

I feel for you
I think I love you
I feel for you
I think I love you

'Cause I feel for you
Feel for you

Baby, baby when I lay with you
There's no place I'd rather be
Can't believe, can't believe it's true
The things that you do to me

I wouldn't lie to you, baby
I'm physically attracted to you
This feeling that I got for you, baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do

I feel for you
I think I love you
I feel for you
I think I love you

I feel for you
I think I love you
I feel for you
I,I, I think I love you
