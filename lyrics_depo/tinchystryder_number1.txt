It was nothing but a quick think
Kids games, kiss chase, just a quick fling
Now I'm hoping you never go missing
Now I'm telling you, you can hold this ring, watch how it glistens

It was done as quick as the wind blows
Didn't think I would ever be involved
So I even wrote a song called 'don't go'
Now it's just you and me on a love row

Dappy like dino us two tip toes duck dive get low
And now I care less about who knows
Now we're deep in way past intro Dappy explain yo


See never did I think a boy like me would be in need
When all I really wanted was to have some fun
Now I'm losing my head, I'm telling you one thing
You're number one


See I don't understand how you're number one
When it was just a fling before now, you're the one
See all I did was blink twice, from my homie to my only
Number one

Ah uh uh oh
Ah uh uh oh
Ah uh uh oh
Ah uh uh oh


Yo
It was all now never planned no after
It was like games jokes laughter
Live for the moment, left it all open
Now I'm in deep, flames, lava, breathe, karma

And now I'm stating, see I never saw this in my daydream
It's really you that I'm fully rating
And the days here no more waiting

Pay it all wise to the smart man raised him
I was so hurt, pain, aching
On the wrong path then a good girl saved him
That's why I'm letting her know she's amazing


See never did I think a boy like me would be in need
When all I really wanted was to have some fun
Now I'm losing my head, I'm telling you one thing
You're number one


See I don't understand how you're number one
When it was just a fling before now, you're the one
See all I did was blink twice from my homie to my only
Number one

You lift me off the ground
I always want you around
I ain't gunna let nothing get in the way
I'll never let nothing get in the way

You lift me off the ground
I always want you around
I ain't gunna let nothing get in the way
I'll never let nothing get in the way


Yo, I ain't never gunna let nothing get in the way
You play your cards all right you're on A's
You make my nights so bright you're my days
You took me out of the maze
You are number one


See I don't understand how you're number one
When it was just a fling before now, you're the one
See all I did was blink twice from my homie to my only
Number one

You lift me off the ground
I always want you around
I ain't gunna let nothing get in the way
I'll never let nothing get in the way

You lift me off the ground
I always want you around
I ain't gunna let nothing get in the way
I'll never let nothing get in the way


You're number one you're in the race you're a leader
Girl you're out of this world I can't see ya
And now you got a place in my heart
It's funny how you actually went
From my homie to my only
Number one
