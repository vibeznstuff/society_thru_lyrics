Swagger jagger, swagger jagger
You should get some of your own
Count that money, get your game up
Get your game up, get your, get your, game up

You can't stop looking at me, staring at me, be what I be,
You can't stop looking at me,
So get up out my face,
You can't stop clicking at me,
Writing 'bout me, tweeting 'bout me,
I can't stop, it's what it gon' be,
My swagger's in check

Get on the floor, get, get, get on the floor
My swagger's in check
Get on the floor, get, get, get on the floor
I got it in check

Swagger jagger, swagger jagger
You should get some of your own
Count that money, get your game up
You're a hater, just let it go

Swagger jagger, swagger jagger
You should get some of your own
Count that money, get your game up
Get your game up, get your game up

You can't stop shouting at me, calling at me, be what I be,
You can't stop looking at me,
So get up out my way,
You can't stop YouTube-ing me,
On repeat, runnin' this beat,
You can't stop, it's funny to me,
I'm laughing all the way

Get on the floor, get, get, get on the floor
Get, get, get on the floor
Get, get, get on the floor
I got it in check

Swagger jagger, swagger jagger
You should get some of your own
Count that money, get your game up
You're a hater, just let it go

Swagger jagger, swagger jagger
You should get some of your own
Count that money, get your game up
Get your game up, get your game up

Hi hater, kiss kiss
I'll see you later
Hi hater,
It was very, very, very nice to meet you

Get on the floor...
Get, get, get...
Get on the floor...
St-st-st-st-staring at me, at me...
Get on the floor...
I got it in check
Get on the floor...
You, you, you can't stop...
Get on the floor...
My swagger's in check
Get on the floor...
You can't, can't s-to-to-to-p
Get on the floor...
I got it in check
