I feel the way the wind blows
It tells me where you’ve been through
I watch the way the sun sets
Until the night’s inside you

Some days I just don’t worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I need to bury the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden
I let salvation be

I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be there for me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
Had to walk with me

I watch the way the crow flies
I know it always seems so easy
But if I see it in a grey sky
Can I be sure about the way it leads me

Some days I just don’t worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I call upon the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden
I watch your soul run free

I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be before me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me

I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be before me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me

Some days will stay a thousand years
Some pass like the flash of a spark
Who knows where all our days go

Out here we lie together
Outside the thunder gathers
Why care about the weather
It always ends in dark

I looked west in search of freedom and I saw slavery
I looked east in search of answers and I saw misery
Some days I just don’t worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I walk into the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden I let my conscience be

I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be before me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
