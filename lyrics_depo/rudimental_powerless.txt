Bury my ghost
Start my glory days
Infiltrate my heart
And take the pain away
Took me time
To see through your eyes
Oh I'm not scared
My words are no lies


Powerless for your love
Powerless for your love


I need to be strong
But you have made me weak
I won't do you wrong
'Cause these feelings run deep
Where do we belong?
I know we'd search to find
'Cause I'm powerless for your love
I think I'm losing my mind


And after it all
Would you still stand up and fight?
When you're hidden in darkness
Would you run towards the light?
Even though I'm alone
I can feel you here with me
I try to block you out
But you're all I see


Powerless for your love
Powerless for your love


I need to be strong
But you have made me weak
I won't do you wrong
'Cause these feelings run deep
Where do we belong?
I know we'd search to find
'Cause I'm powerless for your love
I think I'm losing my mind

Powerless, powerless
I think I'm losing my mind
Powerless, powerless


Tell me this time
You won't let me go
With you by my side
I don't feel alone
I've let go of my pride
Now I can call you my own


I need to be strong
But you have made me weak
I won't do you wrong
'Cause these feelings run deep
Where do we belong?
I know we'd search to find
I'm powerless for your love
I think I'm losing my mind
