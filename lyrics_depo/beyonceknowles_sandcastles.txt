We build sand castles
That washed away
I made you cry
When I walked away, ooh
And although I promised
That I couldn't stay, babe
Every promise don't work out that way, oh babe
Every promise don't work out that way

Dishes smashed on my counter
From our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch I scratched out your name
And your face
What is it about you?
That I can't erase, baby
When every promise don't work out that way
No no oh baby
When every promise don't work out that way

And your heart is broken
Cause I walked away
Show me your scars
And I won't walk away, Ooh
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, bay... baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no no no no no
Every promise don't work out that way
