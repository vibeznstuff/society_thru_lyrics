Sunlight
I'm drifting away somehow
by the presense of the morning sun
I'm falling into the night
as I can see you shining bright

I'm falling into the night
as I can see you shining bright

Sunlight

I'm drifting away somehow
by the presense of the morning sun
I'm falling into the night
as I can see you shining bright

Sunlight
there's nothing like your warm embrace
it feels so right
shining on your sculptured face
