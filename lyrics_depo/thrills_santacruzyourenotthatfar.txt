Well tell me
Where it all went wrong
And tell me
Where you lost those damn songs
I can't say I was surprised
I heard a drink was involved

Oh you gotta be, oh you gotta be
Still living by the sea
Oh you gotta be, oh you gotta be

Cos santa cruz
You're not that far
Oh santa cruz,
No, you're not that far

But now and then here once in a while
Those August cowboys stole your style
Dont you know he feels blind
Well your train's just rolled in on time

Oh you gotta be, oh you gotta be
Still living by the sea
Oh you gotta be, oh you gotta be

Cos santa cruz,
You're not that far
Oh santa cruz,
No, you're not that far
