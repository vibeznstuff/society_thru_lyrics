Feel like a superhero, what type of dreams are these
I’m as high as a eagle, I’m taller than the trees
And I can’t turn back, I tell my heart relax
Late at night, in the dark, I close my eyes
And suddenly everything is gone

I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Reach up for the light
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Devil can’t catch me tonight
I’m not afraid, and I’m not alone
Even if I’m dancing on my own
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted

All I hear is music, I’m losing all control
I have no excuses, can’t say I wasn’t told
If the sky turns black, I’ll tell my heart relax
Late at night, in the dark, I close my eyes
And suddenly everything is gone

I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Reach up for the light
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Devil can’t catch me tonight
I’m not afraid, and I’m not alone
Even if I’m dancing on my own
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted

Feels like I finally finally found it
More than I, than I could have ever imagined
After all this waiting and this holding on
Suddenly everything was gone

I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Reach up for the light
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Devil can’t catch me tonight
I’m not afraid, and I’m not alone
Even if I’m dancing on my own
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
