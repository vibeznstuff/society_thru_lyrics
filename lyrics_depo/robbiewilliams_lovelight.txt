What am I supposed to do
To keep from going under
Now your making holes in my heart and yes it's starting to show
I've been holding back
Is it any wonder?
Since you walked right into my life and interrupted the flow



I wanna know
Baby when you're with me
Who do you think you're foolin'?
Making me feel so sure
Turnin' your lovelight down again
Why don't you let me be
You don't know what you're doin'
Making me feel so sure
And turnin' your lovelight down again

Did it again, did it again
Baby I've got to know
Are we gonna make it?
Lay it down right beside me tonight and do whatever you feel
Baby your in control
Where you gonna take it?
Don't you think that I'll do you right you know darn well that I will


I wanna know
Baby when you're with me
Who do you think you're foolin'?
Making me feel so sure
Turnin' your lovelight down again
Why don't you let me be
You don't know what you're doin'
Making me feel so sure
And turnin' your lovelight down again

Do it again, do it again
Do it again, do it again

Baby you turn your lovelight down
And I don't know, just how long I can stick around
Gonna need more, and it ain't just physical
I dunno what I can do, if I've found that
It ain't love this time around
Keep turning down your lovelight, did it again 



When ever you...
Baby when you're with me
Who do you think you're foolin'?
Making me feel so sure
Turnin' your lovelight down again
Why don't you let me be
You don't know what you're doin'
Making me feel so sure
And turnin' your lovelight down again
