How does it feel runnin' around round round
how does it feel watchin' from upside down
'cos many years from now there will be new sensations
and new temptations
How does it feel

How does it feel right at the start
and how does it feel when you are thrown apart
'cos many years from now there will be new elations
and new frustrations

How does it feel? Oh! Oh!
Do you know know know what it's like to be searchin' in your own time
all your attempting experimenting all on the climb
do you know know know what it's like to be searchin' and suddenly find
all your illusion, all your confusion all left behind

How does it feel turnin' away
and how does it feel facing another day
'cos many years from now there will be newer poisons
and new horizons

'cos many years from now there will be new tomorrows
and still some sorrows
