Yeah, we're not the only ones
Who bleed for the love that's lost
Trust, like the air we breathe
Live, you've got to loose some sleep

Everything you do for me
Everything I do for you
Everything you do for me
No one else comes close to you

You laugh when the cool get's cold
Cry when the punchline's told
Fall into the arms of God
Pray that your soul's not sold

Change keeps us moving on
All alone as you walk through the crowd
Live we're gonna loose some sleep
Trust like the air we breathe

Anything I do for you
Anything you do for me

The way you see the world
The way you see the world
The way you see the world
The way

Everything you do for me
Everything I do for you

The way you see the world
No one else comes close to you
No one else comes close to you
No one else comes close to you
