I didn't think so.
You ever tried with all your heart and soul to get you lover back to you?
I wanna hope so.
You ever pray with all your heart and soul just to watch her walk away?

You ever toss and turn your lying awake and thinking about the one you love?
I don't think so.
You ever close your eyes your making believe your holding the one your dreaming of?
Well if you say so.
I hurts so bad when you finally know just how low, low, low, low, low, she'll go.

Baby did a bad bad thing, baby did a bad bad thing.
Baby did a bad bad thing, feel like crying, feel like crying.

Ohh. Feel like crying, feel like crying.
Ohh, feel like crying, feel like crying.

Baby did a bad bad thing, baby did a bad bad thing.
