I'm feeling all messed up
I have a voice inside my head it says turn to the left then it says turn to the right
Don't want to bring you down
But I am really needing guidance now
What would you do within my shoes 
(don't cry) I'm going crazy
(stay high) I've never felt so low
(don't hide) I want to turn and run
we've got to find a place to go

so when you're feeling kind of mixed up
just remember it's a mixed up world
and when you're feeing life is just too tough
just remember you're a real tough girl

I look around my life
And all I see is contradiction and a lack of faith
Cynicism rules the day
I know it has it's place
But I am really needing guidance now
Reminding me I'm strong inside

(don't cry) I know you love me
(stay high) and we'll make it through this time
(don't hide) I want to feel the sun
we've got to start to take control

(why) do I feel this pain 
(why) has this world gone insane
