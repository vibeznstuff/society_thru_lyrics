This European air
It always warms my face
I wish I could pass on
I will bring you stories
And bleary-eyed photos
Like a regular tourist
We don't go breaking down
I feel like nothing ever will
We don't go breaking down
I feel like nothing
Suitcases down our street
Are rolling once again
I roll away with them
Five days inside Zoo York
To lose myself with friends
I'm nowhere without you
We don't go breaking down
I feel like nothing ever will
We don't go breaking down
I feel like nothing ever will
We will never go breaking down
I feel like nothing
Just wanna be with you 
My baby
Just wanna be with you
My baby
Just wanna be with you
My baby
Just wanna be with you
My baby
I'm counting up the cost of time
And when I waste some time away
We cannot save ourselves alone
Or live life on a mobile phone
I'm counting up the cost of time (just wanna be with you, my baby)
And when I waste some time away (just wanna be with you, my baby)
We cannot save ourselves alone (just wanna be with you, my baby)
Or live life on a mobile phone (just wanna be with you, my baby)
Just wanna be with you
My baby
Just wanna be with you
My baby
Just wanna be with you
