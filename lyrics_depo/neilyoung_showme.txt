Do you see people being led by the righteous hand
Taking care of everyone like they're on a piece of land

Show me
Show me
Show me

Do you see people's lives being lost on the sacred land
And the battle over water being fought for the baby's hand

Show me
Show me
Show me
Show me

When the women of the world are free to stand up for themselves
And the promises made stop gathering dust on the shelf

Show me
Show me
Show me
Show me

Well I hear you out there when you say what you have to say
I know how you feel cause that's what made me this way
When heaven on earth is improved by the hand of man
And people everywhere get together and join their hands

Show me
