Sometimes it's easier to hide away
When the winter comes and it's shorter days
But I know the dark clouds won't stay
Tomorrow is gonna be better

Sometimes it's easier to hit the road
When the world is givin' you a heavy load
But if you stay and face it, I know...
Tomorrow is gonna be better


Let the rain fall
Let the raaaaaain fall
'Til the day is new
And all that's left is me 'n you

I know it's just one of those days
But you just stay strong
I'm gonna find a way to take it all
And make it okay
Tomorrow is gonna be better
Tomorrow is gonna be better
