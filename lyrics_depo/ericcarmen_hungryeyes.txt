I've been meaning to tell you
I've got this feelin' that won't subside
I look at you and I fantasize
You're mine  tonight
Now I've got you in my sights


With these hungry eyes
One look at you and I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I

I wanna hold you so hear me out
I wanna show you what love's all about
Darlin' tonight
Now I've got you in my sights



Now I've got you in my sights
With these hungry eyes
Now did I take you by surprise
I need you to see
This love was meant to be



Now I've got you in my sights
With these hungry eyes
Now did i take you by surprise
I need you to see
This love was meant to be.

I got Hungry Eyes
