She works at hot topic
His heart microscopic
She thinks that its love but to him its sex
He listens to emo but fat mike's his hero
His bank account's zero
What comes next?

Same song different chorus


It's stupid, contagious
To be broke and famous
Can someone please save us from punk rock 101
My Dickies, your sweat pants
My spiked hair, your new Vans
Let's throw up our rock hands for punk rock 101

She bought him a skateboard, a rail slide, his knee tore
He traded it for drums at the local pawn shop
She left him for staring at girls and not caring
When she cried because she thought Bon Jovi broke up

Same song second chorus



Don't forget to delay... on the very last word

Seven years later he works as a waiter
She married a trucker and he's never there
The story never changes, just the names and faces
Like Tommy and Gina they're living on a prayer

Did you just say that?
I said



It's stupid, contagious (same song different chorus)
To be broke and famous (same song different chorus)
Can someone please save us from punk rock 101
My Dickies, your rock hands
My spiked hair, your new Vans
Let's shoplift some sweatbands for punk rock 101
