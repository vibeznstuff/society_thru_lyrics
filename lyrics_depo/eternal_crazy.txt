What they say
They say I'm crazy when it comes to you
(No matter what they say)
(No words I know can keep me away from your love)
(They say I'm crazy)
This is why 

They see me walking down this lonely avenue
They see me talking when I'm the only one in view
(They say I'm crazy)
Well I'm not crazy
(Maybe a little crazy)
When it comes to you 

I hear them whisper
Certainly, she's lost her mind
And draw conclusions on any reasons they can find
They say I'm crazy
Well I'm not crazy
(Maybe a little crazy)
When it comes to you
(They say I'm crazy)
Well I'm not crazy
(Maybe a little crazy)
When it comes to you, you 

(When it comes to you)
All others just a waste of time
(When it comes to you)
There is nothing more on my mind
(When it comes to you)
I'm just in love
(I'm just in love)
And a little (crazy)
When it comes to you
Yes I'm just crazy
When it comes to you 

They've come to notice
That it's a smile I always wear
And those who notice
That when I'm down it's still there
(They say I'm crazy)
Oh, but I'm not crazy
(Maybe a little crazy)
When it comes to you 

(When it comes to you)
All others just a waste of time
(When it comes to you)
There's nothing more on my mind
(When it comes to you)
I'm just in love
(I'm just in love)
And a little crazy when it comes to you 

(When it comes to you)
All of my problems seem to fade
(When it comes to you)
All of those nights turn to day
(When it comes to you)
I'm just in love
(I'm just in love)
And a little crazy when it comes to you
Yes I'm a little crazy, hey
When it comes to you, you, yeah 

(No matter what they say)
(No words I know can keep me away from your love)
They say I'm crazy when it comes to you
(Say I'm crazy)
But I'm not crazy
(Maybe a little crazy)
When it comes to you
(Say I'm crazy)
Well I'm not crazy
(Maybe a little crazy)
Hey, when it comes to you
(Crazy) when it comes to you
