You might think I'm crazy
To hang around with you
Maybe you think I'm lucky
To have something to do
But I think that you're wild
And inside me is some child
You might think I'm foolish
Or maybe it's untrue
You might think I'm crazy
But all I want is you

You might think it's hysterical
But I know when you're weak
You think you're in the movies
And everything's so deep
But I think that you're wild
When you flash that fragile smile
You might think it's foolish
What you put me through
You might think I'm crazy
But all I want is you

And it's so hard to take
There's no escape without a scrape
You kept it going till the sun fell down
You kept it going

You might think I'm delirious
The way I run you down
But somewhere sometime
When you're curious
I'll be back around
And I think that you're wild
And so uniquely styled
You might think it's foolish
This chancy rendezvous
You might think I'm crazy
But all I want is you
