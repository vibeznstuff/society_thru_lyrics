The sun beats hard on an empty beach where I tried so hard
But couldn't reach the stars in your eyes
You were just a child when I came to you and we were friends
'Till love stepped in, and you stepped away
I would lie and curse the day
And visit places where we lay alone
And find them turned to stone

Because you hold the heart of someone new
I'll take a chance on time
Hold out here for something true
Standing out of line
But I would wait a hundred years to hear you say my name
The way you did before he came, the way you will again

I fell apart and you came to me
I never can explain how much it turned me round
Much more than upside down

Because you hold the heart of someone new
I'll take a chance on time
Hold out here for something true
Standing out of line
But I would wait a hundred years to hear you say my name
The way you did before he came, the way you will again

And I love the sun, and I need the rain
And I know the way that you left me was only to test me
And I was vain
And I will be strong
And I will be warm
And I will let no one come near me until you will hear me
Just once again

And time will wear a mountain down
And make a lover of the clown who laughed too long
And colored you wrong

Now I hold the heart of someone new
I'll take a chance on time
Hold out here for something true
Standing out of line

But I would wait a hundred years to hear you say my name
The way you did before he came, the way you will again
But I would wait a hundred years to hear you say my name
The way you did before he came, the way you will again
