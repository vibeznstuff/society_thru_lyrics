Automatic, Automatic, Automatic, Automatic, Automatic

You give me that special feeling, Boy
I've been awake all night
There's a beat inside my heart again
its working overtime

No-one's moved me in this way before
its all so brand new
You got me so I don't know where I am
or what I'm gonna do

And I'm ready anytime
Automatic High
And I'm walking over Cloud 9
Automatic High

When I hear you calling out to me
It makes me come alive

and all the fears seem to fade away
and I've kissed the past goodbye

And I'm ready anytime
Automatic High
I got one thing on my mind
Automatic High

Every step, every breath, every beat of my heart
coming on like a new sensation
Its just so easy

It's Automatic, Automatic High, High, High, High.
Automatic, Automatic, Automatic, Automatic.
Automatic, Automatic, Automatic, Automatic.

And I'm ready anytime
Automatic High
And I'm walking over Cloud 9
Automatic High

Automatic, Automatic, Automatic, Automatic.
Automatic, Automatic, Automatic, Automatic.
Automatic, Automatic, Automatic, Automatic.
