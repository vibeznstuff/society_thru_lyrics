I'm in with the "in" crowd
I go where the "in" crowd goes
I'm in with the "in" crowd
And I know what the "in" crowd knows (how to have fun)
Any time of the year, don't you hear? (how to have fun)
Dressin' fine, makin' time
We breeze up and down the street
We get respect from people we meet
They make way day or night
They know the "in" crowd is out of sight

I'm in with the "in" crowd
I know ev'ry latest dance
When you're in with the "in" crowd
It's easy to find romance (and we work out)
At a spot where the beat's really hot (and we work out)
If it's square we ain't there
We make ev'ry minute count
Our share is always the biggest amount
Other guys imitate us
But the original's still the greatest

We got our own way of walkin
We got our way of talkin' (gotta have fun)
Any time of the year, don't you hear (gotta have fun)
Spendin' cash, talkin' trash
Girl, I'll show you a real good time
Come on with me and leave your troubles behind
I don't care where you've been
You ain't been nowhere till you been in with the "in" crowd
With the "in" crowd
With the "in" crowd
