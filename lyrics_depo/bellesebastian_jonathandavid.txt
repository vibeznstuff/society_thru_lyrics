I know you like her
Well I like her too
I know she likes you
It's not as if I'm being sent off to War
There are worse things in this world

There's still room on my wooden horse for two
I was Jonathan to your David
You're still King

Well, I'd thought about her
I dreamed she'd come, I'd make my escape
I thought she liked me but somehow I was wrong
I know you don't want it this way
But it's O.K.

It's not like we'll be parted
It's not like we never know love

And she'll smile for you
She'll hold your hand
You'll be in love there's no other way
And I will make it some day

I know you like her
Well I like her too
I know she likes you
It's not as if I'm being sent off to War
There are worse things in this world

There's still room on my wooden horse for two
I was Jonathan to your David
You're still King

Visions of love recollected
Have we ever been true?
I know that I have, it's time for you to go
It's all in the stones that you throw
I want you to know

It's not like we'll be parted
It's not like we never know love

And she'll smile for you
She'll hold your hand
You'll be in love there's no other way

People say that
"We'll never change"
"We'll never change"
But I have

You and her in the local newspaper
You will be Married and you'll be gone

Married and you'll be gone
