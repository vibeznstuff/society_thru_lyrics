One time a long time ago,
On a mountain in Switzerland,
Yo lo lo lo,
There lived a fair young maiden,
Lovely but lonely,
Oh oh oh oh.

Day after day,
She'd pine her heart away,
Yo lo lo lady ya,
But no love came her way.

Some day papa said,
Some day we'll go,
Down to the village in the valley,
Then you'll meet a nice young man,
Ask for your hand,
Then you'll be happy

Every day she grew unhappier,
On a mountain in Switzerland,
Yo lo lo lo,
Every day a little bit lonelier,
Which way to turn and which way to go

Day after day,
She'd pine her heart away,
Yo lo lo lady ya,
But no love came her way.

Some say the maidens dream,
Never came true,
She never got to go to the valley,
If she did or not,
I really don't know, Oh oh oh oh.
Did she die unhappy?

I'd rather think she found her love,
Wouldn't she be better if she did find love?
Somewhere,
Some way.

Yo lo lo lady ya
Yo lo lo lady ya
