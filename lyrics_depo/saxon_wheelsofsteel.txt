Oww

When my foots on the throttle there's no looking back
I leave the motor tickin' over when she's back on the track
I've got a 68 Chevy with pipes on the side
You know she's my idea of beauty, that's what I drive

She's got wheels, wheels of steel
She's got wheels of steel
Wheels of steel
Talking 'bout my wheels of steel

I don't take no jibe from the motorway pigs
When I'm crusin' down the freeway I don't get no lifts
If you see me coming get out of my way
You know a Trans Am didn't, I blew it away

She's got wheels, wheels of steel
She's got wheels of steel
Wheels of steel
My my my my wheels of steel

I'm burnin' aviation fuel my foot's to the floor
Ya know she's crusin one-forty she'd do even more
I'm burnin' solid rubber I don't take no bull
'Cause my wheels of steel are rolling
They're rolling your way

She's got wheels, wheels of steel
Wheels of steel
My my my wheels of steel
Wheels of steel
Talking 'bout my wheels of steel

Look out, uh

I'm burnin' aviation fuel my foot's to the floor
Ya know she's crusin' one- forty she'd do even more
I'm burnin' solid rubber I don't take no bull (shit)
'Cause my wheels of steel are rolling
If you're comin' come quick

She's got wheels, wheels of steel
She's got wheels of steel
Wheels of steel
My my my wheels of steel
Wheels of steel

Talking 'bout my wheels of steel
Wheels of steel
Wheels of steel
My my wheels of steel

Uh, ya, wheels of steel
