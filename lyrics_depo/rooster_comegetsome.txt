Baby it Dont Matter,
Anyone Can See The Signs,
I caught you looking over, with just a little bit of a smile,
You tell him that you love him, while im running through your mind.
Cos i know, that you know,
your cover will blow it's only a matter of time.

It's Not My Style, to try an cheat and lie,
why do you sanctify something that already died.
I've got something that'll bring you alive.

Are you gonna shout it from the rooftops honey,
Tell me i'm the only one,
Kick em to the curb and baby dont stop running,
Tell me are you gonna come get some.

Did you ever ask yourself the question'
Where the hell did i go wrong?'
Cos you know when it's true,
I'll be waiting for you,
So tell me how you gonna come, come
Come Get Some.

All those words your wasting,
Trying to tell yourself you need more time,
But whats the point in faking,
When you know your'll never make it right.
You say your head is blurry but i cant get you out of mine.
I don't mean to cause pressure,
but i just cant let ya,
go on while your living this lie.

It's not my style,
To let this pass me by,
Why do you sanctify something thats already died.

I've got something that'll bring you alive,
Are you gonna shout it from the rooftops honey,
Tell me i'm the only one,
Kick em to the curb and baby dont stop running,
Tell me are you gonna come get some.

Did you ever ask yourself the question'
Where the hell did i go wrong?'
Cos you know when it's true,
I'll be waiting for you,
So tell me how you gonna come, come
Come Get Some.

Pushed out and waiting,
Blackedout and fading,
Flaked out and shaking,
Just breaking for you 
Freaked out and pacing,
I just cant go on like this forever.

Are you gonna shout it from the rooftops honey,
Tell me i'm the only one,
Kick em to the curb and baby dont stop running,
Tell me are you gonna come get some.

Did you ever ask yourself the question'
Where the hell did i go wrong?'
Cos you know when it's true,
I'll be waiting for you,
So tell me how you gonna come, come
Come Get Some.
