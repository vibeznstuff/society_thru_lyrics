Just a kiss, just a smile
Hold my hand for just once in a while
That's all I need, all I need and I'll be satisfied
Think of me when you're away
Call me darling just once a day
That's all I need, that's all I need and I'll be satisfied

True love came to me when I met you
True love makes me know I won't forget you
When you're around me it makes me feel
Life is worth living baby love is so forgiving

Just a kiss, just a smile
Hold my hand for just once in a while
That's all I need, all I need and I'll be satisfied
Think of me when you're away
Call me darling just once a day
That's all I need, that's all I need and I'll be satisfied

True love came to me when I met you
True love makes me know I won't forget you
When you're around me it makes me feel
Life is worth living baby love is so forgiving

Just a kiss, just a smile
Hold my hand for just once in a while
That's all I need, all I need and I'll be satisfied
Think of me when you're away
Call me darling just once a day
That's all I need, that's all I need and I'll be satisfied

True love came to me when I met you
True love makes me know I won't forget you
When you're around me it makes me feel
Life is worth living baby love is so forgiving

I'll be baby listen to me

That's all I need, all I need and I'll be satisfied
That's all I need, all I need and I'll be satisfied
That's all I need, that's all I need...
