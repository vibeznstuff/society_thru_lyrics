Some people wake up, scared of living their dream
They'll settle for anything
Some wanna live an airbrushed world, like the cover of a magazine
But I believe in thunder bolts and butterflies
When you look into my eyes
I pray tonight that we won’t fail
Click my heels, got a real life fairytale


If Cinderella was here tonight
She wouldn’t walk out the door leaving you behind
Midnight calling but she don’t care
She’d be a fool not to follow you everywhere
Because for you I would lose both, both of my shoes
Stay all night, see the light
That’s all I wanna do

Some people get lost, looking up at the sky
Waiting for shooting stars
Some never take their eyes of the sidewalk
They'll never take a step too far

But I believe the planets and the stars align
When you look into my eyes
I pray tonight your kiss won’t fail
Click my heels got a real life fairytale


But, if Cinderella was here tonight
She wouldn’t walk out the door leaving you behind
Midnight calling but she don’t care
She’d be a fool not to follow you everywhere
Because for you I would lose both, both of my shoes
Stay all night, see the light
Walking home with you
For you I would lose both, both of my shoes
Stay all night, see the light
That’s all I wanna do


Three AM, kissing in the corner
Four AM, running from a doorman
Five AM, dancing in the street lights
Just in time for us to see the sunrise


If Cinderella was here tonight
She wouldn’t walk out the door leaving you behind
Midnight calling but she don’t care
She’d be a fool not to follow you everywhere
Because for you I would lose both, both of my shoes
Stay all night, see the light
Walking home with you
For you I would lose both, both of my shoes
Stay all night, see the light
It’s all I wanna do
