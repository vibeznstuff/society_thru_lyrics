I get high on a buzz, then a rush
When I'm plugged in u
I connect when I'm flush
U get love when told what to do
Wonderful electric, wonderful electric
Wonderful electric, cover me in u

I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with a strict machine
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with a strict machine

When u send me a pulse
Feel a wave of new love through me
I'm dressed in white noise
U know just what I want so please
Wonderful electric, wonderful electric
Wonderful electric, cover me in u

I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with a strict machine
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with a strict machine

I'm in love

I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with a strict machine
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with a strict machine
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with a strict machine
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with a strict machine
