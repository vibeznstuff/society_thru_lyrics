Starting something, thought it could be fun
I started something, couldn't go wrong

Danger, heartache, I'd always knew
There's no winner, in this game you lose

But I still wanna know how she got in the door uninvited

Oo-ooh I got a rocket
Oo-ooh you're going on it
Oo-ooh you're never coming back

This is secrets, stories unfold
Flow by pleasure, losing control

Danger, heartache, something has died
No good pretending, I'm leaving this time

But I still wanna know how she got in the door uninvited

Oo-ooh I got a rocket
Oo-ooh you're going on it
Oo-ooh you're never coming back

Oo-ooh I got a rocket
Oo-ooh you're going on it
Oo-ooh you're never coming back

You're never coming back
You're never coming back again no no
You're going out on your own

You're never coming back
You're never coming back again oh no
You're going out on your own

Oo-ooh I got a rocket
Oo-ooh you're going on it
Oo-ooh you're never coming back

Oo-ooh I got a rocket
Oo-ooh you're going on it
Oo-ooh you're never coming back
(you're never coming back)
