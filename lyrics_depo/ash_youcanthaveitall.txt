When I get high, you always bring me down 
Everything I try hit the stony ground 
Got me so confused and now you're feeling good 
Ever changing moods, I don't know what I should do... 

Scratches down my back, when we're making love 
Give you all my time, but it's not enough 
In and out of style, like the music scene 
Feels like I'm living in a magazine 

You can't have it all 
You can't have it all 
You can't have it all 
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh 

Voices in your head, always doubting me 
Paranoid distortions of reality 
You tell me all the time that there's something wrong 
But you never know what you really want 

You can't have it all 
You can't have it all 
You can't have it all 
You can't have it, you can't have it all 
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh 

You...can't...have...it...all 
You...can't...have...it...all 

I'm losing my mind, it comes too easily 
Blaming someone else for your misery 
Walking on eggshells until you're feeling bad 
This psycho drone is taking over my life 

You can't have it all 
You can't have it all 
You can't have it all 
You can't have it, you can't have it all 

You can't have it all 
You can't have it all 

You can't have it all
