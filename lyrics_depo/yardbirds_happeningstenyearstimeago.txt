Meeting people on my way
Seemingly I've known one day
Familiarity of things
That my dreaming always brings

Happenings ten years time ago
Situations we really know
But the knowing is in the mind
Sinking deep into the well of time
Sinking deep into the well of time

Walking in the room I see
Things that mean a lot to me
Why they do I'll never know
Memories don't strike me so
Memories don't strike me so

It seems to me I've been here before
The sounds I heard, and the sights I saw
Was it real, was it in my dreams
I need to know what it all means

Happenings ten years time ago
Situations we really know
But the knowing is in the mind
Sinking deep into the well of time
Sinking deep into the well of time
