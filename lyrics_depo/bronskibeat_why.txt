Contempt in your eyes when I turn to kiss his lips
Broken I lie, all my feelings denied, blood on your fist

Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?

You in your false securities
Tear up my life, condemning me
Name me an illness, call me a sin
Never feel guilty, never give in

Tell me why?
Tell me why?
Tell me why?
Tell me why?
Yeah!

You and me together, fighting for our love
You and me together, fighting for our love
You and me together, fighting for our love
You and me together, fighting for our love

You and me together, fighting for our love
You and me together, fighting for our love
You and me together, fighting for our love
You and me together, fighting for our love

Contempt in your eyes when I turn to kiss his lips
Broken I lie, all my feelings denied, blood on your fist

Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?

Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?

Can you tell me why?
