Oh, I don't wanna have to take your arm
But I will, said I will
Don't wanna have to damage anyone
But I'd kill, kiss and kill
I don't intend to take this lying down
With my head between my hands, no
I don't intend to copy any bird
That keeps it's head stuck in the sand, oh

You scratch my back
And maybe I'll claw yours
You understand being used
And if you feel a little itchy now
You won't mind being abused

Tonight...the towers crumble
Tonight...the mountains fall
Tonight...no one stumbles
Tonight...no one stalls
Scratch you tonight

You don't wanna have to spill those beans
but you will, I said you will
You got the numbers and the papers here
And you will, kiss and spill
You check me out and then you reel me in
Oh you check and you reel real fine
You're slummin' now with all those friends you got
You've been slumming in the slime

You scratch my back
And maybe I'll claw yours
You understand being used
And if you feel a little itchy now
You won't mind being abused

Tonight...the towers crumble
Tonight...the mountain falls
Tonight...no one tumbles
Tonight...no one calls
Scratch you tonight

We're itchin' tonight, scratch you tonight
All right, all right, you want me tonight, yeah
Want me tonight, all right, all right
Do it tonight, sit tight
Fool me tonight, yeah yeah

Tonight...the towers crumble
Tonight...the mountains fall
Tonight...I heard you fumble
Tonight...the motor stalls
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
