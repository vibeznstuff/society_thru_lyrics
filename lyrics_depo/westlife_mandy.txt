I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
Shadows of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
The night goes into

Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me oh Mandy


Well you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
I Walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing
The tears are on my mind
And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy



Yesterday's a dream I face the morning
Crying on the breeze
The pain is calling, oh Mandy



You came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you...

Oh Mandy won't you listen to what I've got to say
Oh Mandy don't you let me throw it all away
Oh Mandy won't you listen to what I've got to say
And I need you today, oh Mandy
