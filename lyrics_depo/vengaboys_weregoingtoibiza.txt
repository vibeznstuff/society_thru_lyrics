Welcome Aboard Venga Airways 
After Take Off Will Pump Up The Soundsystem 
Cause We're Going To Ibiza!

I Don't Wanna Be A Busdriver 
All My Life 
I'm Gonna Pack My Bags And Leave This Town 
Grab A Flight 
Fly Away On Venga Airways 
Fly Me High 
Ibiza Sky 

I Look Up At The Sky 
And I See The Clouds 
I Looked Down At The Ground 
And I See The Rainbow Down The Drain
