Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain is fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin', "It's all right"

Rainy night in Georgia
Rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs flashin'
Taxi cabs and buses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

Rainy night in Georgia
Rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world
Seems like it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
And it still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it or think of it
It's life, and you just gotta play the game

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out this old guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest and I'm alright

Rainy night in Georgia
Rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world
Yeah, I believe it's rainin' all over the world
I believe it's rainin' all over the world, and it's rainin' on me
