Love is blind, as far as the eye can see, 
Deep and meaningless, words to me, 
Easy lover, I need a friend, 
Road to nowhere, twist and turns but will this never end. 
Well my dear you'll know that he pleases me 
(Pleases me), 
But sometimes illusion ain't no revolution, 
That ain't no release for me, 
Too Much of 
Something is bad enough, 
But something's coming over me to make me wonder, 
Too Much of nothing is just as tough, 
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied. 
I wrapped myself from around your finger, 
Hold me too tight or left to linger, 
Something fine built to last, 
Slipped up there I guess we're running out of time too fast, 
Yes my dear you know he soothes me 
(Moves me), 
There's no complication there's no explanation, 
It's just a groove in me. 
Too Much of something is bad enough 
(Bad enough), 
But something's coming over me to make me wonder, 
Too much of nothing is just as tough (just as tough), 
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied. 
What part of no don't you understand 
(Understand understand), 
I want a man not a boy who thinks he can, 
Boy who thinks he can! 
Too Much of 
Something is bad enough, 
But something's coming over me to make me wonder, 
Too Much of nothing is just as tough, 
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied. 
Too much of something is bad enough 
(Bad enough), 
But something's coming over me to make me wonder, 
Too much of nothing is just as tough (just as tough), 
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied. 
Too much of something is bad enough 
(Bad enough), 
But something's coming over me to make me wonder, 
Too much of nothing is just as tough (just as tough), 
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied. 
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try, 
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie.
