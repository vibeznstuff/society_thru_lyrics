And freaky be beautiful, you came following me like I knew you would

You tickle my fancy, tickled my sense of fun

I'm pressing the beak to my cheek and it's thickening
Kick off turns the sun

Freaky be beautiful, he falls
And his blood it sprays so cold
On my face, he feels so cold
Freaky be beautiful, oh no, oh no
Freaky be beautiful, oh no, oh no

Freaky be beautiful, he falls
And his blood it sprays so cold
On my face, he feels so cold
Freaky be beautiful, he falls
And his blood it sprays so cold
On my face, he feels so cold

For the loss and I will not deny
I'm winding, I'm winding, I'm winding, I'm winding
I need help, I need help, I need help, I need help
I need help, I need help
