Don't let your white dress wear you out
Oh it hurts to look in your eyes
cos honey I can see him

All my life 
I'd hurt the ones I'd loved
Oh but baby you can turn it round

She don't love me like you
She don't know what you do
And it's so hard
She don't care what you say
So just say it, say it anyway
It's so hard

All my life, they tried to push me down
Oh but baby you can turn it round
Oh but honey I still see him

Don't let your friends tell you why
Cos I'm a bad, bad, bad ....
I'm the one
Oh but baby you can turn it on

She don't love me like you
She don't know what you do
And it's so hard
She don't care what you say
So just say it, say it anyway
It's so hard

All those years gone by
I only wanna find a way 
To make it hard for you 

You'll never forget it 
The way that she let....
She don't feel the same
I only wanna find a way
To make it hard for you 

She'll never forget it 
The way that she let
She don't feel no pain
I only wanna find a way
To make it up to you 

She'll never forget it 
The way that she let
She don't feel the same
I only wanna find a way
I only wanna find 
I only wanna find 

She don't love me like you 
She don't love
She don't
