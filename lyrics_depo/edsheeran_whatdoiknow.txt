Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, "Son, don't you get involved
In politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels."

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene,
I know when I have children, they will know what it means
And I'll pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love and understanding positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Saying love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?

Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fitting in your jeans
It's love and understanding positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Saying love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?

Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene,
You know the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understanding positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talking about exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Saying love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?

Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
