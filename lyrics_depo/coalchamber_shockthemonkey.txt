Cover me, when I run.
Cover me, through the fire.

Something not beyond the greed.
God i'm on my knees, cover me.
Die in peace.
Hey!

Monkey, monkey, monkey.
Don't you know you gotta, shock the monkey.
Hey, hey!

Fox the fox.
Rat all the rats.
You can ape the ape.
I know about that.
There is one thing you must be sure of,
I can't take anymore.
Darling, don't yout monkey with the monkey.
Hey!

Monkey, monkey, monkey.
Don't you know you gotta, shock the monkey.
Hey! Hey!
Shock the monkey! Hey!

Wheels keep turning.
Monkey!
Somethings burning.
Monkey dont like it but I guess I'm learning.
Shock! Shock! Shock!
Watch the monkey get hurt, monkey.

Cover me, when I sleep.
Cover me, when I breathe.
You throw your pearls before the swine,
make the monkey blind.
Cover me, darling please.
Hey!

Too much at stake.
Monkey!
Ground beneath me shake.
Monkey! And the news is breaking.

Shock!
