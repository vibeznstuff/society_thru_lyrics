Call it love and devotion
Call it a mom's adoration
Foundation
A special bond of creation,
Ha

For all the single moms out there
Going through frustration
Clean Bandit, Sean-da-Paul, Anne-Marie
Sing, make them hear


She works at nights by the water
She's gone astray so far away
From her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him


Daily struggle


She tells him, "Ooh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love.
I'm gonna give you all of my love.
Nobody matters like you."


Stay up there, stay up there


She tells him, "Your life ain't gon' be nothing like my life." (Straight!)
"You're gonna grow and have a good life.
I'm gonna do what I've got to do."


Stay up there, stay up there


So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Rockabye, no


Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
(Rockabye, yeah, oh, oh)
Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye


Single mom, how're you doing out there?
Facing the hard life without no fear (yeah)
Just so you know that you really care
'Cause any obstacle come you're well prepared (oh, no)
No, mama, you never shed tear
'Cause you have to shed things year after year
And you give the youth love beyond compare (yeah)
You find his school fee and the bus fare (yeah)
Mmm, Marie, the pops' disappear
In the wrong bar, can't find him nowhere
Steadily you work flow, everything you know
So you nah stop, no time–no time for your jeer


Now she got a six-year-old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks in her eyes
He don't know he is safe

When she says, "Ooh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love.
I'm gonna give you all of my love.
Nobody matters like you."


So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
(Oh-badda-bang-bang-bang, alright then)
Rockabye, no


Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
(Rockabye, yeah, oh, oh)
Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
Rockabye, don't bother cry
Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky
Rockabye, don't bother cry
Angels surround you, just dry your eye


Now she got a six-year-old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks in her eyes
He don't know he is safe when she says...


She tells him, "Ooh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love.
I'm gonna give you all of my love.
Nobody matters like you."
(Stay up there, stay up there)
She tells him, "Your life ain't gon' be nothing like my life." (Straight!)
You're gonna grow and have a good life.
I'm gonna do what I've got to do."
