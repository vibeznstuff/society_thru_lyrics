Have you ever been lost in love, when you were seventeen
Have you ever had a dirty thought, an' tried to keep 'em clean
Did you ever have days like these, spend it on the job
Have you ever been lost in love, gone runnin' with the mob … runnin' with the mob

There are so many reasons, you keep on wantin' more
You're a friend in the bad times, that's what friends are for … woh

Have you ever been lost in love, I never would have guessed
They tell me you're a big boy now, well an' truly blessed
Did she ever go overboard, keep the wolf at bay
Have you ever been lost in love, it happens every day … happens every day

There are so many reasons, you keep on wantin' more
You're a friend in the bad times, that's what friends are for … yeah, yeah

There are so many reasons, you keep on wantin' more
You're a friend in the bad times, that's what friends are for

There are so many reasons, you keep on wantin' more
You're a friend in the bad times, that's what friends are for … woh, yeah
