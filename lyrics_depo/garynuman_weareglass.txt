We are young we can break
Watch us fall
We can take some train
Down to the sea
We are glass, we are glass

We are real you can touch
Just for now
And I say
'Hey you which way is down?'
We are glass, we are glass

We are strong
We're unknown
We have time
And to you I'm just one of those boys
We are glass, we are glass

We are cold
We're not supposed to cry
But it's all just a thought so
Here am I
We are glass, we are glass

They run fast impressions
Of the floors inviting
Stay with me, stay with me
They run past with telephones
They scream
Well would you
Turn all this down
Turn all this down

You are replaced
You are you
And now dreams are real
And dreams are all we need
We are glass, we are glass

They run fast impressions
Of the floors inviting
Stay with me, stay with me
They run past with telephones
They scream
Well would you
Turn all this down
Turn all this down
