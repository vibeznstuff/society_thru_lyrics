Do you still remember 
How we used to be 
Feeling together, believe in whatever 
My love has said to me 
Both of us were dreamers 
Young love in the sun 
Felt like my saviour, my spirit I gave ya 
We'd only just begun 

Hasta Manana, 
Always be mine 


Viva forever, I'll be waiting 
Everlasting, like the sun 
Live forever, 
For the moment 
Ever searching for the one 

Yes I still remember, 
Every whispered word 
The touch of your skin, giving life from within 
Like a love song that I'd heard 
Slipping through our fingers, 
Like the sands of time 
Promises made, every memory saved 
Has reflections in my mind 

Hasta Manana, 
Always be mine 



Back where I belong now, 
Was it just a dream 
Feelings unfold, they will never be sold 
And the secret's safe with me 

Hasta Manana, 
Always be mine
