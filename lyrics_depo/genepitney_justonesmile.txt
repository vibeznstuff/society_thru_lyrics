Can't I cry? A little bit
There's nobody to notice it
Can't I cry if I want to
No one cares

Why can't I pretend
That you love me again
All I've had has been taken from me
Now I'm crying and tears don't become me

Just one smile the pain's forgiven
Just one kiss the hurt's all gone
Just one smile to make my life worth living
A little dream to build my world upon

How I wish I could say
All the things that I want to say
If some way you could see what's in my heart
I don't ask for much
A look, a smile, a touch
Try to forget Lord knows I'm trying
But it's hard to forget when your whole world is dying

Just one smile the pain's forgiven
Just one kiss the hurt's all gone
Just one smile to make my life worth living
A little dream to build my world upon
Just one smile the pain's forgiven
Just one kiss the hurt's all gone
Just one smile to make my life worth living
A little dream to build my world upon
