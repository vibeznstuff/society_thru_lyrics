Ten little Indians standing in a row
All dressed up, but nowhere to go
Lookin' for a target
Lookin' for a man

Just get me outta here
It's not the place my mind's been thinkin' of
Just push me out again
It's no use hangin' round or hangin' on

Ooh, seven little Indians standing in a row
The compere walks on the stage and he says, "Sing it girls."
"Okay!"
(Doo-bee doo-bee doop doop bop bop)
But the band's no good, and the song don't cut it

Just get me outta here
It's not the place my mind's been thinkin' of
Just push me out again
It's no use hangin' round or hangin' on
(Doo-bee doo-bee doop doop bop bop)
Hangin' on
(Doo-bee doo-bee doop doop bop bop)

Come on, let's go tonight
We got a brand new way to celebrate it
Oh, I got this rage to love
Baby, it's so right, and if you feel it, great! 
Dedicate it
Oh, I got this rage to love

Three little indians cryin' in their make-up
Nobody stops and nobody cares

Just get me outta here
It's not the place my mind's been thinkin' of
Just push me out again
It's no use hangin' round or hangin' on
(Doo-bee doo-bee doop doop bop bop)
Hangin' on
(Doo-bee doo-bee doop doop bop bop)

Come on, let's go tonight
We got a brand new way to celebrate it
Oh, I got this rage to love
Baby, it's so right, and if you feel it, great! 
Dedicate it
Oh, I got this rage to love
(Doo-bee doo-bee doop doop bop bop, doo-bee doo-bee doop doop bop bop)

Come on, let's go tonight
We got a brand new way to celebrate it
Oh, I got this rage to love
Baby, it's so right, and if you feel it, great! 
Dedicate it
Oh, I got this rage to
Oh, it's just this rage to
Oh, I got this rage to love

(Doo-bee doo-bee doop doop bop bop)
I got, I got, I got, I got
(Doo-bee doo-bee doop doop bop bop)
I got this rage to love
(Doo-bee doo-bee doop doop bop bop)
I got, I got, I got, I got
