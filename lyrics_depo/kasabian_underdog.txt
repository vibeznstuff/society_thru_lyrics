Kill me if you dare, hold my head up everywhere
Keep myself right on this train
I'm the underdog, live my life on a lullaby
Keep myself riding on this train
Keep myself riding on this train

Love in Technicolor sprayed out on walls
Well, I've been pounding at the pavement till there's nothing at all
I got my cloak and dagger in a bar room brawl
See the local loves a fighter, loves a winner to fall

Feels like I'm lost in a moment
I'm always losing to win
Can't get away from the moment
Seems like it's time to begin

Kill me if you dare, hold my head up everywhere
Keep myself right on this train
I'm the underdog, live my life on a lullaby
Keep myself riding on this train
Keep myself riding on this train

It don't matter, I won't do what you say
You've got the money and the power, I won't go your way
I can't take from the people, they don't matter at all
I'll be waiting in the shadows till the day that you fall

Feels like I'm lost in a moment
I'm always losing to win
Can't get away from the moment
Seems like it's time to begin

Kill me if you dare, hold my head up everywhere
Keep myself right on this train
I'm the underdog, live my life on a lullaby
Keep myself riding on this train

Tell me if you're down, throw your weapons to the ground
Keep myself right on this train
Hey bird you're on the wire, sold yourself for another one
Keep myself riding on this train
Keep myself riding on this train
