I would like to say that I never meant to make you cry,
I think about you everyday, no matter what your friends might say,
Everybody knows my name, even thought I'm still the same,
I just would like to say that I, I never ever meant to make you Cry


I would like to know why, there are clouds in the sky,
Every time I fall in love
and I would like to know why I'm sitting here on my own.
I would like to know why, when I find a nice guy,
someone I can lean upon
I mess it all up and then I wonder why I'm all alone.
Tell me if you think that I'm talking way too much,
Tell me if you'd like to stay in touch.




Sitting on the sofa, letting life go by,
Thinking about the Early days
Thinking about the times when I heard you with my crazy ways
All I wanna do is look around for you, yeah drive until the break of dawn
Tracking and calling and pleading till your coming home

Tell me if you think that I've been a bit too much, 
Tell me if you'd like to stay in touch.



I didn't mean to be so cruel, I didn't mean to let you down,
So sorry for the rain on your parade and all the pain you must have gained because of me.
