I can't get out of bed today
Or get you off my mind
I just can't seem to find a way
To leave the love behind


I ain't trippin
I'm just missing you
You know what I'm saying
You know what I mean

You kept me hanging from a string
Why you make me cry?
I tried to give you everything
But you just gave me lies




Every now and then
When I'm all alone
I be wishing you would call me on the telephone
Say you want me back 
But you never do
I feel like such a fool
There's nothing I can do..
I'm such a fool
For you


I can't take it
What am I waiting for?
My heart's still breaking
I miss you even more
And I can't fake it
The way I could before
I hate you but I love you
I can't stop thinking of you 
It's true 
I'm stuck on you

Now love's a broken record that's
Been skipping in my head
I keep singing yesterday
Why we got to play these games we play?



Every now and then
When I'm all alone
I be wishing you would call me on the telephone
Say you want me back 
But you never do
I feel like such a fool
