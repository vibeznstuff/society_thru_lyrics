Baby don't you know, I'm here to give my lesson
Somethin' bout your body, girl just gives me direction.
How to find that spot. I ain't Young Money girl but my bed rock.
So won't you let your hair down, let me take a picture
Tell me what's your zodiac, cancer's my description.
Girl and I don't stop, that's right we go from six to nine o' clock.
I ain't too proud to beg, yeah
(you're a superstar, girl you are)
It's all up in my head, oh you

Haha Luda!
Let me touch your body like you be fresh up out the tub and you rub that lotion.
Make you get on all fours and put one leg up,
like your body's doin' three-wheel motion
In the ocean coastin', overdosin', toastin' with the magic potion.
Told them that they can't hold or control 'em
No one, I'm the magic trojan
Golden like the wrapper lookin' dapper
then I put her on her back and attack her.
No time for the chitty chat, just give me ya kitty cat and you'll get it back after,
we set the mood right, givin' you a little relaxation.
I'ma get your groove right, take your body on a little vacation.
We island hoppin, and clubs is rockin', and haters jockin'.
Trunk pop lock droppin' and speakers knockin' and bottles poppin'.
I could talk all day let me stimulate your mind while I tell you what I like in you,
but now I'ma just sit back and let Jeremih tell you what he'd like to do..


I'd like to take the time to love your body
Rub your body, kiss, and hug your body
Girl say ooh ooh I Like, ooh ooh I Like

So I'm gonna take the time to love your body
Rub your body, kiss, and hug your body
