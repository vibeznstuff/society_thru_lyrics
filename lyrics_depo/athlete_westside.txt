All the energetic people they all sparkle as they're walking down the street
Can't see their faces but i've noticed they seem to have big hands the stage is set, is the glamour,
Who's got my etnies?
Now you know that i can see you and you know that it is easy
To see me something has been on my mind, something has struck me kind of odd, look out for quicksand,
There is high ground
Who wants this rockscene?

We sing
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rockscene
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rockscene

Now the time has come and yeah the show it must stay strong
And are we all part of the latest craze or is this how we mend our ways
I can hear the taxi calling, telling me we haven't left yet.
As the lights go on we're out tonight somehow you seem to stand out
In a crowd you raise the tempo in the disco as you make this place your own
The stage is set, is the glamour i'm in this rockscene


Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rock scene
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rock scene
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rock scene
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rock scene

House on the rock
Surely it will last forever?
House on the rock
Don't you know it's now or never?
House on the rock
Surely it will last forever?
House on the rock


Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rock scene
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rock scene
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rock scene
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rock scene

When when when when whenever, rock scene
