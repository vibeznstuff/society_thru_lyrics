Fed up with your indigestion.
Swallow words one by one.
Folks got high at a quarter to five.
Donâ€™t you feel your growing up undone. 

Nothing but the local DJ,
who said he had some songs to play.
What went down from his fooling around
gave hope and a brand new day.

Imagine all the girls
Ah, ah, ahh, ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah
And the boys
Ah, ah, ahh, ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah
And the strings
Ee, ee, eee, eee, ee, ee, ee, ee
And the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums
Oh!

Nothing was the same again
All about where and when
Blowing our minds in our life unkind
gotta love the BPM.
When the smoke was all baton
Remembering how this begun.
We wore his love like a hand in a glove
Where the future plays it all night long.

and nothin' but the girls
Ah, ah, ahh, ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah
And the boys
Ah, ah, ahh, ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah
And the strings
Ee, ee, eee, eee, ee, ee, ee, ee
and "the drums" 

Imagine all the girls
Ah, ah, ahh, ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah
And the boys
Ah, ah, ahh, ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah
And the strings
Ee, ee, eee, eee, ee, ee, ee, ee
and the drums
Ah, ah, ahh, ahh, ah, ah, ah, oh

all the girls
Ah, ah, ahh, ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah
And the boys
Ah, ah, ahh, ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah
And the strings
Ee, ee, eee, eee, ee, ee, ee, ee
and the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums.
