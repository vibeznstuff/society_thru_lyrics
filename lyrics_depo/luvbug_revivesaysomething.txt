What I want right now is somewhere I can go
Somewhere that will take me far away from what I know
Everything is clear whenever you are near
The weight is off my shoulders, all my worries disappear

Oh baby, the moon and the stars
Oh baby, tell us who we are
Oh baby, giving me new life
Baby, you have set me free and now I am revived

Say something, do something
Say something, do something
Say something, do something
Say something, do something

And now I am revived
Baby, you have set me free and now I am revived

All I need right now is a deeper love
Someone I can rest my head on when the times get tough
Living every day locked in your embrace
And I feel no pain and all my tears have gone away

Oh baby, the moon and the stars
Oh baby, tell us who we are
Oh baby, giving me new life
Baby, you have set me free and now I am revived

Say something, do something
Say something, do something
Say something, do something
Say something, do something

And now I am revived
Baby, you have set me free and now I am revived

Say something, do something
Say something, do something
Say something, do something
Say something, do something

And now I am revived
Baby, you have set me free and now I am revived
