Right now, say, "Lord, have mercy!"

I've got the money
I've got the place
You've got the figure
You've got the face
Let's get together
We're jumping all over
All over the world

Sing it! (Jumping all over the world)

You've got the figure
Full of delights
Let's get together
We're jumping all over
All over the world

Let me hear you! (Jumping all over the world)

I've got the position
I've got the name
You've got the power
To drive me insane
Let's get together
We're jumping all over
All over the world

Everybody! (Jumping all over the world)

You've got the figure
You've got the face
Let's get together
We're jumping all over
All over the world

All together now!
