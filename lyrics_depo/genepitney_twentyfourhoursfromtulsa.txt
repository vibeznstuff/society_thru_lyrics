Dearest darling
I had to write to say that I won't be home any more 
For something happened to me 
While I was driving home and I'm not the same any more 

Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa 
Ah, only one day away from your arms 
I saw a welcoming light 
And stopped to rest for the night 

And that is when I saw her 
As I pulled in outside of the small hotel she was there
And so I walked up to her 
Asked where I could get something to eat and she showed me where 

Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa 
Ah, only one day away from your arms 
She took me to the café 
I asked her if she would stay 
She said, "Okay" 

Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa 
Ah, only one day away from your arms 
The jukebox started to play 
And night time turned into day 

As we were dancing closely 
All of a sudden I lost control as I held her charms 
And I caressed her, kissed her 
Told her I'd die before I would let her out of my arms 

Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa 
Ah, only one day away from your arms 
I hate to do this to you 
But I love somebody new 
What can I do
When I can never, never, never go home again?
