When I was a young boy, my mama said to me
There's only one girl in the world for you
And she's probably in Tahiti
Or Maybe she's in the Bahamas
Where the Caribbean Sea is blue
We've been in a tropical moonlight night
'Cause nobody taught her 'bout you

I'd call go the whole wide world, I'd call go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd call go the whole wide world, I'd call go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her

Why am I hanging around in the rain out here
Trying to pick up a girl
Why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears
When there's girls all over the world
Is she lying on a tropical beach somewhere

Underneath the tropical sun
Pining away in a heat wave there
Hoping that I won't be long
I should be lying on that sun soaked beach with her
Caressing her warm brown skin
Then in a year or maybe not quite
We'll be sharing the same next of kin

I'd call go the whole wide world, I'd call go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd call go the whole wide world, I'd call go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her
I'd call go the whole wide world, I'd call go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd call go the whole wide world, I'd call go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her
