Girl, come on over here 
Let me hold you for a little while 
And remember I'll always love you 
Forever 
Everything changes but you 

We've said goodbye, the taxi cab is waiting 
Now don't you cry, just one more kiss 
Before I have to go 
Hey girl I know the situation changed 
And so much is new but something in my life 
Remains the same cos 

Everything changes but you 
We're a thousand miles apart 
But you know I love you 
Everything changes but you 
You know everyhting single day 
I'll be thinking about you 

The rumors true, you know that there've been others 
What can I do, I tell you baby they don't mean a thing 
Now girl don't go and throw our love away 
I'll be home soon back in your arms to hear you say that 

Eveything changes but you 
We're a thousand miles apart 
But you know I love you 
Everything changes but you 
You know everyhting single day 
I'll be thinking about you 

Everything changes but you 
We're a thousand miles apart 
But I still love you 
Everything changes but you 
I'll spend everyhting single day 
Thinking about you 

Though everything changes around us 
(Baby don't U cry) 
We will be the same as before more 

Everything changes but you 
We're a thousand miles apart 
And I still miss you baby 
Everything changes but you 
You know everyhting single day 
I'll be thinking about you 

Everything changes but you 
I'll be thinking about you, 
Thinking about you 
Everything changes but you 
Cos you know I love you 
Know that I love you 

Everything changes but you 
I'll be thinkin' about you, 
Thinking about you 
Everything changes but you 
I love you, I love you
