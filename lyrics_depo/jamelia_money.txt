Money don't say you love me
Cash won't make me stay
And I can leave the same way
I came here with my own things

And if you really cared babe
You would spend your time
If you don't understand
You can't afford mine so
Ain't a pre-madonna

So I can't fall in love with material things
You need to offer more than chains and dimond rings
I need to know that theres a place for me deep in your heart
I don't give a damn, 'bout your credit card so

Money don't say you love me
Cash won't make me stay
I came here with my own things

And I can leave the same way
And if you really cared babe
You can't afford mine no
You would spend your time
If you don't understand

I must admit it I was fine with your talkin' an gifts to start
Now all thats wanted is to know I got your heart
I don't really care, for your ammount a' dough
I have no idea, 'bout where this is gonna go
Money don't say you love me
Cash won't make me stay
I came here with my own things
And if you really cared babe
And I can leave the same way

You would spend your time
If you don't understand
You can't afford mine no

So you think I got a price tag on me?
Just a' flash your cash and your all I see (all I see)
Well let me tell you something you couldn't be more wrong about me.
All your fancy cars they just don't turn me on, you got me wrong
Make all the money that you can coz money don't make a good man

Money don't say you love me
Cash won't make me stay
I came here with my own things
And I can leave the same way
And if you really cared babe
If you don't understand
You would spend your time
Money can't buy my love
You can't afford mine no

Money cant buy my love
Money can't buy my love
