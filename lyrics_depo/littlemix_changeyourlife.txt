She captures her reflection then she throws the mirror to the floor
Her image is distorted screaming, "Is it worth it anymore?"

 No-oh-oh


Are you scared of the things that they might put you through?
Does it make you wanna hide the inner you?


You're not the only one so let them criticize, oh oh oh oh
You're untouchable when you realize, oh oh oh


Change, change your life, take it all
We're gonna stick together, know we'll get through it all
Change, change your life, take it all ( Yeah, take it all)
You're gonna use it to become what you've always known
( Become what you've always known)


His body starts to flicker like nobody wants to know his name
Just another soul with feelings but nobody's there to feel the pain

 No, no, no


They can rip you, bring you down, down to their size
But they will never get to the heart you hold inside
Mm, mm, mm


You're not the only one so let them criticize, oh oh oh oh
You're untouchable when you realize, oh oh oh


Change, change your life, take it all ( Take it all)
We're gonna stick together, know we'll get through it all ( I know we'll get through it all)
Change, change your life, take it all ( Yeah, take it all)
You're gonna use it to become what you've always known ( Become what you've always known)
Change, change your life, take it all
( Change your life and take it all)
Change, change your life, take it all
( Change your life and take it all)

 You got a right to show the world
 Something never seen
 We wanna hear you scream it out
 You're not alone


Oh, whoa,
Oh, yeah


Change, change your life, take it all ( Take it all)
We're gonna stick together, know we'll get through it all ( We're invincible)
Change, change your life, take it all ( Change your life and take it all)
You're gonna use it to become what you've always known ( Become what you've always known)
