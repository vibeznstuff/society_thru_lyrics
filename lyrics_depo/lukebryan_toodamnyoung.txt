We met down at the floatin' dock
She snuck out scared, she might get caught
We were nervous, but it was worth it

There was no such thing as consequence
With her in my arms it finally made sense
In that moonlight, I saw her tan lines

Every time my feet are danglin' in the water
I can't help but think about her
Lyin' there with her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doin' but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
T-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better

The fog rolled in, she said "I better go"
She took my t-shirt and wore it home
A memory, a souvenir she could keep

So I stayed and watched that sunrise
Like it was wakin' up my life
To what love was, I can still see us

Every time my feet are danglin' in the water
I can't help but think about her
Lyin' there with her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doin' but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
T-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better


We were too damn young to know any better
