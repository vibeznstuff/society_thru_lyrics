Came a time in my life
I had to be free
From all the lies
That used to be me
And the only way out is the only way in
And it's you

I've been waisting my time
But not anymore
I've been through the maze
And it lead to your door
And the only way out is the only way in
And it's you
I spent a lot of time at the crossroads
Getting that lonely feeling inside
Suddenly you stopped the rain
And you changed the view
Now every where's leading to you

Let's get this thing going
Let's move it along
Let me do all the things
I've been missing so long
'cos the only way out is the only way in 
And it's you

I spent a lot of time at the crossroads
Getting that lonely feeling inside
Suddenly you made the rescue
You Pulled me through
Now let me do something for you
Let's get this thing going
Let's move it along
Let's do all the things
I've been missing so long
And the only way out is the only way in
And it's you

Yeah the only way out is the only way in
And it's you
