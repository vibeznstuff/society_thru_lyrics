Don't hang up your shoes, just kick out the blues
And rock 'til you drop tonight
All we do depends upon you
So rock 'til you drop tonight

We made all the high spots, the star studded bills and the mirror balls
Half of the time we were playing a game
Half of the time I could hardly remember my name

So stay with us now, and hang in somehow
And rock 'til you drop tonight
Rock 'til you drop tonight
Rock 'til you drop

We hit all the high spots, the star studded bills and those mirror balls
Half of the time we were playing a game
Half of the time I could hardly remember my name

So stay with us now and hang in somehow
And rock 'til you drop tonight
All we do depends upon you
So rock 'til you drop tonight
Rock 'til you drop tonight
Rock 'til you drop tonight
Rock 'til you drop tonight
