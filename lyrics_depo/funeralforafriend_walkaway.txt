All the words that we have to say
They don't leave when the moment comes 
We know we have to wait
As the days go on and the places fade away
to dirt and to dust, it all fades away

And the waiting is the hardest thing to take
In a moment more before we break

If you have to let it go
And these dreams keep you awake
If you have to let it go
Walk away

And the shapes we want to see
Don't leave another piece that this puzzle needs

And the waiting is the hardest thing to take
In a moment more before we break

If you have to let it go
And these dreams keep you awake
If you have to let it go
Walk away

And the waiting is the hardest thing to take
In a moment more before we break

If you have to let it go
And these dreams keep you awake
If you have to let it go
Walk away

If you have to let it go
And these dreams keep you awake
If you have to let it go
Walk away (walk away)

If you have to let it go
And these dreams keep you awake
If you have to let it go
Walk away (walk away)
