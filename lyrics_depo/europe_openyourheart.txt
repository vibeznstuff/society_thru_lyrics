Days filled with joy and days filled with sorrow
I don't know just what to do
Am I happy today, am I lonely tomorrow
Everything depends on you

I've been waiting for the angels to knock on my door
I've been hopin' that everything could be like before

Open your heart and tell me what's wrong
Why can't you talk like you used to do before
I don't know if I'm weak, I don't know if I'm strong
Hey girl, I can't cope anymore

I've been waiting...

Open your heart, let me hear you 
Make up your mind, I want to hear you call 
Open your heart, want to come near you 
Make up your mind, before we lose it all 

Maybe that time has it's own way of healin' 
Maybe it dries the tears in your eyes 
But never changes the way that I'm feelin' 
Only you can answer my cries

I've been waiting...

Open your heart, let me hear you 
Make up your mind, I want to hear you call 
Open your heart, want to come near you 
Make up your mind, before we lose it all  Guitar solo (x2)
