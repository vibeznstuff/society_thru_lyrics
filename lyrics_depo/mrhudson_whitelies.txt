I suppose I was thinking about how nothing's ever black n white in life.
Sometimes you've got to bend the rules you know? To get where you need to be.
And this is coming from a pretty straight forward shallow as a puddle fella.
Perhaps that's why I find lying interesting.
Bcos I don't indulge in it very often.
Any way, waffle over. Enjoy. Ben
White Lies

Lying, I still can't find the truth.
So I spin another line on you
You can't blame a fella for trying
I'm hoping, you eat my every word
Doesn't it taste so good?
But deep inside I'm dying
Oh! I wanna word with you
If there's never a perfect time
It's time for another white lie
White lies, just another white lie
I did it to get close to you
And I will tell a million more
White lies, just another white lie
I do it to get close to you
And I will tell a million more white lies
One day, I know you'll understand
That I didn't really have much choice
I just had to hide it

Sometimes, good men do bad things
Just as bad men can do good
Tell me which way you like it
Oh! I wanna word with you
There's never a perfect time
However much I try
Oh! Why don't you sit yourself down?
Cause we gotta talk this through
It's time for another white lie...
White lies, just a little white lie
I did it to get close to you
And I will tell a million more
White lies, just a little white lie
I do it to get close to you
And I will tell a million more white lies
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I was just playing girl, I was just playing by your rules
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Just another white lie and I'll tell a million more
White lies...
