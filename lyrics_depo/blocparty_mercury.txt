My mercury's in retrograde

This is not the time, the time to start a new love
This is not the time, the time to sign a lease
Try not to worry about whats forgotten
Try not to worry about whats been missed
Scars on shins and scars on my knuckles
Today I woke up in a basketball court
Jonjo's in Sydney and he aint returning
Im sitting in soho trying to stay drunk

In any bar in the world
From Silverlake to Williamsburg
You could pick another stranger
And fall in love 

My mercury's in retrograde

This is not the time, the tie to start a new love
This is not the time, the time to sign a lease
Try not to worry about whats forgotten
Try not to worry about whats been missed
Bleeding gums and veins protruding
You're starting to hate all of your clothes
Neumayrs in LA and she aint returning
Im sleeping with people I don't even like

My mercury's in retrograde

When I say you last night
I wanted to say, run away with me
Away from the cynics
That this could be the start of
Something truly real...
But all that I could say was "hey"

My mercury's in retrograde
