Got a picture of a glorious day 
A sunny afternoon somewhere with a view 
And I don 't care what it's all about 
As long as I'm with you 

And I I wanna run away with you 
I, I wanna run away with you 
Wanna get a car and just drive away 
Looking at the view and listening to tunes 
And I don't care what we talk about 
As long as I'm with you 
And I I wanna run away with you 
I, I wanna run away with you 

La da da da da da 
La da da da da da da r
La da da da da da 


And I, I wanna run away with you
I, I wanna run away with you

I, I wanna run away with you
I, I wanna run away with you, with you
