Its not over
I'm not going home til I can take you with me
I'm not going home
Its not over
I'm not going home til I can take you with me
I'm not going home
Come with me
Come with me

A simple tension a run through me chest
My simple intention
Tonight me na rest
Till I invest these proceedings with vigour and zest
And trigger wetness under your vest
Test your fitness
Special request to my love interest
Impressed
I watch the rhythm slide right up your dress
I watch the rhythm slide right up your dress
I watch the rhythm slide right up your dress

Induce a case of mild madness
Cook it til it's black
Cos we like it just a tad crisp

Its not over
I'm not going home til I can take you with me
I'm not going home
Its not over
I'm not going home til I can take you with me
I'm not going home
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me

Outside the club there's a line o taxi
I wan ya climb next to me on the back seat
I need your company to relax me
I wanna know just how you come so sexy
That we both here together has profound meaning
I'm so down with you I can feel your breathing
On me skin
Tell the doormen we wont be leaving
Till ten
And notta one of the them will we be needing
You give me something to believe in
Now kiss me properly and stop your teasing.

Its not over
I'm not going home til I can take you with me
I'm not going home
Its not over
I'm not going home til I can take you with me
I'm not going home
Its not over
I'm not going home til I can take you with me
I'm not going home
Its not over
I'm not going home til I can take you with me
I'm not going home
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
