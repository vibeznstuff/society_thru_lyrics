I'm just sittin' here reminiscin'
Wonderin' who you've been kissin'
Baby, oh-oh baby
I've been wanderin' all around
There must be a new guy in town
You don't love me any more
I'll get over you-a-oo baby
Although my heart's still sore
Well, you know my heart's still sore

When I think of all the lies you told
To that young man my heart you've sold
You're a cheater and a mean mistreater
When I think of all the fun we had
Kind of makes me feel so sad
I'm lonely for your love
And the longest day I live
It's only you that I'll be thinkin' of
You know I'm thinkin' of
Well, it's you I'm thinkin' of
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
