I smoke myself into a haze in the afternoon
Enveloped heart and the air is cool
Put on your dress, white Goddess
And settle in, as the weather folds
In the slow haze of the afternoon
Swaying hips, made like a gun
Blackest sails, the most beautiful, star

In the world, in the air, on my tongue
Before my eyes, beyond the stars, beneath the sun

So, take me in your arms again
Lead me in my dreams again
So, what is it worth?
I'll sell my soul, what is it worth?
Only you know

You were conceived in my heart, came like a dream
To save me from my mortality
Put on your dress, white Goddess
And settle in, as the weather folds
Our lives will be entwined, even when I die
You'll see me through 'til the end of time
No earthly bride, the most beautiful, star

In the world, in the air, on my tongue
Before my eyes, beyond the stars, beneath the sun

So, take me in your arms again
Lead me in my dreams again
So, what is it worth?
I'll sell my soul, what is it worth?
Only you know

Take me in your arms again
Lead me in my dreams again
So, what is it worth?
I'll sell my soul, what is it worth?
I'll sell my soul, what is it worth?
I'll sell my soul, what is it worth?
