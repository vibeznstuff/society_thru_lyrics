Just like I predicted, we're at the point of no return
We can go backwards, and no corners have been turned
I can't control it, if I sink or if I swim
'Cause I chose the waters that I'm in

And it makes no difference who is right or wrong
I deserve much more than this
'Cause there's only one thing I want


If it's not what you're made of
You're not what I'm looking for
You were willing but unable to give me anymore
There's no way,
You're changing,
Cause some things will just never be mine,
You're not in love this time...but it's alright.

I hear you talking, but your words don't mean a thing
I doubt you ever put your heart into anything
It's not much to ask for, to get back what I put in
But I chose the waters that I'm in

And it makes no difference who is right or wrong
I deserve much more than this
'Cause there's only one thing I want


If it's not what you're made of
You're not what I'm looking for
You were willing but unable to give me anymore
There's no way,
You're changing,
Cause some things will just never be mine
You're not in love this time...but it's alright.

What's your definition of the one?
What do you really want him to become?
No matter what I sacrifice it's still never enough.

Just like I predicted
I will sink before I swim
'Cause these are the waters that I'm in


If it's not what you're made of
You're not what I'm looking for
You were willing, but unable to give me anymore
There's no way,
You're changing,
'Cause some things will just never be mine
You're not in love this time.
Oh, if it's not what you're made of
You're not what I'm looking for
You were willing, but unable to give me anymore
There's no way,
You're changing,
'Cause some things will just never be mine
You're not in love this time
You're not in love this time
You're not in love this time...
