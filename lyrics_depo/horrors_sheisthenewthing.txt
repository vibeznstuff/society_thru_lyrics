She's a special girl, you know,
The kind I'd hope to see,
Hanging on a wall,
Watching me cross the street

I wonder how long it will be,
Before I'm sick of her,
And I no longer care
Where she goes or has been,

'Cause she's the new thing
'Cause she's the new thing
She is the new thing
'Cause she's the new thing

She is the new thing,
She is the new thing,
Another new thing,
Feel my stomach sink,
As I cast myself in
She is the new thing
Always the new thing
Staring at her,
Alterior girl

Once she had me on my knees,
Enamoured with disease
Now, she fails to impress
A different sickness
A different kind of sickness,
Lacking any interest

And I, sunk in apathy,
Totally absorbed in me
Sitting vacant on my own,
My senses lying prone

She was the new thing 
Another new thing 

She was the new thing
Another new thing
Feel my stomach sink
As I curse my slow limbs
She was the new thing
Another new thing,
Staring at her,
Alterior girl,
I cast myself into whatever she brings...
Another new

With sickness,
It ends how it begins:
First mine then hers,
And then the cycle blurs
As my actions reoccur
Through no fault of my own 
I am a new thing
