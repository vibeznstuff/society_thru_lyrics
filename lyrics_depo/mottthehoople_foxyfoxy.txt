Baby Baby tried to phone you - they said you were gone
Baby Baby please come home to me where you belong
Foxy Foxy - you're all I have to hold
Don't leave me alone out in the cold

Baby Baby how I missed you - my love grows so strong
Baby Baby wanna kiss you all night long
Foxy Foxy oh you're all I'm living for
You're all I see - I need nothing more

When I put my arms around you - I'll surround you
Make a vow to
Never see you sighing - darling when you cry it makes me die

Foxy Foxy oh I need you every day
Not just when you want - not just when you say
But I know I'll always love you
Stars above shine down upon you
Never leave me ever
Darling will you be forever true?
Foxy Foxy come out tonight
Foxy Foxy it'll be alright
Foxy Foxy oh let me into your heart
Foxy Foxy give me one more chance
Foxy Foxy give me one more dance
Foxy Foxy don't let them keep us apart
Foxy Foxy don't neglect me
Foxy Foxy please don't reject me
Foxy Foxy don't let it end 'fore it starts
Foxy Foxy oh-oh-oh-oh
Foxy Foxy oh-oh-oh-oh
Foxy Foxy oh-oh-oh-oh
