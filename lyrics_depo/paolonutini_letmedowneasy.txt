Let me down easy
For your love for me is gone
Let me down easy
Since you feel to stay is wrong

We are broken by others
But we mend ourselves
We take comfort in strangers
But I don't think it helps
If every fool wore a crown
I would be a king and not a clown
Cause love can be (oh)
Closer than our hands and our feet

But it's lost on me
Oh oh
It's lost on me
Let me down easy
For your love for me is gone
Let me down easy
Since you feel to stay is wrong

There was no sweeter fruit than this
With no taste of bitterness
It was so fresh and sweet before
But I can't taste it anymore
No, no

I was like a man with no care
I had everything
But it's lost,
Lost, lost on me, yeah

Let me down easy
For your love for me is gone
Let me down easy
For your love for me is gone
Let me down easy
Since you feel to stay is wrong

On a better day
We'd be waiting on our corner
Selling dreams of redemption
But this time you've gone your way
So I'll go mine
Out of sight, out of love, out of time

Let me down easy
For your love for me is gone
Let me down easy
For your love for me is gone
Let me down easy
Since you feel to stay is wrong

Let me down, let me down easy
Let me down easy
Let me down easy
Let me down easy
