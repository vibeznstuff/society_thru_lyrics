Everybody's having a real good time
The man you're talking to is not yours, he's mine
Better chill out, hear what I'm saying
Before I stop the music playin'


It's my party, I'll start it, I'll end it
Baby, it's my party, I'm upset and offended

While I'm all alone, and the party's goin' strong
It's a celebration, to better our relation
A sudden flash in my vision
Rendezvousin' in the kitchen
Kit got lost, and I found him all involved
He was wearing a guilty face
He had his arms around her waist
And lipstick on his face



Everybody's having a real good time
The man you're talking to is not yours, he's mine
Better chill out, hear what I'm saying
Before I stop the music playin'

Say you had too much to drink
Lost your head and couldn't think
A sudden flash in my vision
Rendezvousin' in the kitchen
Then you got lost, and I found you all involved
Wearing a guilty face
Had your arms around her waist
And lipstick on your face

 Oh, tell me what it is
 Ooh, you had lipstick on your face
 Oh, tell me what'd you see
 Rendezvousin' in the kitchen
 Oh baby, what it's gonna be
 Gonna stop this music playing
 Oh, do you trust in me
 It's very plain to see
