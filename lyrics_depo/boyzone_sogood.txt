I've heard it before
And you're telling me no, and I'm crazy
We're talking too fast
We've just got to take it nice and slow
Sit back let it flow now
Don't be misunderstood
When baby, maybe, you know...

We're gonna be so good
Like I knew we would
Like only we could
Come on and hear me now
Gonna be so good
Cos it's understood
Like I knew we should
So good now, baby...

No matter the cost
When we're out on the town
Getting lazy
I'll show you who's boss
We're just gonna take it all away
No matter what they say now

Be so good
Be so good now



So good
Cos it's understood
You know we're good...
