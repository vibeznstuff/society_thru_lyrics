People try to judge me
they remember the old me

All I know is all I own

Everybody moving
Set the rhythm grooving
Send The Rhythm through me

Well I don't know what I'm gonna be,
Everybody wants me to be free,
Everybody get down to the beat,

The the the the the truth truth truth truth truth is is is no words

You can. You know what it's for.

But right now, fuck it yeah.

Well I've been around some time
And I don't know what I'm doing
??
And now everybody's prayin'

Well i don't know what I'm gonna be,
Everybody wants me to be free,
Everybody get down to the beat,

The the the the the truth truth truth truth truth is is is no words

You can. You know what it's for.

Diddly dum dum dum here I come

I don't know what I'm gonna find
Won't somebody help me?
