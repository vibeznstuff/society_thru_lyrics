It's difficult to love you when you do the things you do
Time and time again.
And when I try to turn it off, you turn from smooth, you play it rough,
Once again.

Pride that pulls me into this ocean subsides again
So high and so dry with these bitter emotional lies again.

You make me CRY, You make me CRY again,
You make me CRY, And the tears roll by again.
