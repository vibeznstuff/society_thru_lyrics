I’ve been waiting for my dreams 
To turn into something 
I could believe in 
And looking for that 
Magic rainbow 
On the horizon 
I couldn’t see it 
Until I let go 
Gave into love and watched all the bitterness burn 
Now I’m coming alive 
Body and soul 
And feelin’ my world start to turn 

And I’ll taste every moment 
And live it out loud 
I know this is the time, 
This is the time 
To be more than a name 
Or a face in the crowd 
I know this is the time 
This is the time of my life 
Time of my life 

Holding onto things that vanished 
Into the air 
Left me in pieces 
But now I’m rising from the ashes 
Finding my wings 
And all that I needed 
Was there all along 
Within my reach 
As close as the beat of my heart 

So I’ll taste every moment 
And live it out loud 
I know this is the time, 
This is the time to be 
More than a name 
Or a face in the crowd 
I know this is the time 
This is the time of my life 
Time of my life 

And I’m out on the edge of forever 
Ready to run 
I’m keeping my feet on the ground 
My arms open wide 
My face to the sun 

I’ll taste every moment 
And live it out loud 
I know this is the time, 
This is the time to be 
More than a name 
Or a face in the crowd 
I know this is the time 
This is the time of my life 
Time of my life 
More than a name 
Or a face in the crowd 
This is the time 
This is the time of my life. 
This is the time of my life.
