Day-Out Oo Oo Oo

She was born in a handbag
Love left
on a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup
Nothing seems to make a dent
Gonna find her some money honey
Try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about


Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out

Day-In Oo Oo
Day-Out Oo Oo Oo

First thing she learns is
she's a citizen
Some things they turn out right
When you're under the USA
Something rings a bell 
and it's all over
She's going out her way
Stealing for that one good rush

Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out

She could use a little money
She's hangin' on his arms
like a cheap suit
She's got no money, honey 
She's on the other side
Oh come on little baby
Late night, big town, 
police, shake down

Oo Oo

Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out

Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out

She's got a ticket to nowhere
She's gonna take a train ride
Nobody knows her, or knows her name 

She's in the pocket of a home boy
Oo she's gonna take her a shotgun Pow
Spin the grail spin the drug
She's gonna make them well aware
She's an angry gal

Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out

Suddenly there's angels everywhere
Angels in a ton of sound
And they shootin' her down
Shootin her with video-drugs-bullets and promises
