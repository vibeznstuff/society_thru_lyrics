Half past nine, quarter to two, ten fifteen
And we’re coming round again
Hold off, are we going soft
Flushed my Zoloft, and we’re coming round again
Found out and I almost drowned
Walked back down, and we’re coming round again

If I could talk I’d tell you
If I could smile I’d let you know
You are far and away
My most imaginary friend

If I could talk I’d tell you
If I could smile I’d let you know
You are far and away
My most imaginary friend

Khmer Rouge, je ne sais quo
Your place or mein kampf, now I’m giving the dog a bone
Slight hunch without the vaguest clue
To keep the blood balanced and we’re coming around again
Half past nine, quarter to two, ten fifteen
And we’re coming round again

If I could talk I’d tell you
If I could smile I’d let you know
You are far and away
My most imaginary friend

If I could talk I’d tell you
If I could smile I’d let you know
You are far and away
My most imaginary friend
