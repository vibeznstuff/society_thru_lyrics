It's the way you pick your clothes off the floor
It's the way you scratch your skin when you yawn
It's the t-shirts that you choose like you're in the air force
Yeah the language that you use reacts like chemicals

Obsessions in my head don't connect with my intellect
It's called obsession can you handle it?
It's connected to the hip sound and it moves with the underground
It's called obsession when you're around

It's the way you close the doors of my car
It's the stupid things you bought with my credit card
It's the way you don't read Camus or Bret Easton Ellis
Yeah the TCP you use it stings when we kiss

Obsessions in my head don't connect with my intellect
It's called obsession can you handle it?
It's connected to the hip sound and it moves with the underground
It's called obsession when you're around

Obessions it's like sex it's simple and complex
It's called obsession can you handle it?
It's connected to the hip sound and it moves with the underground
It's called obsession when you're around
