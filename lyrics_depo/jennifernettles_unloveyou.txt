I could break down and cry
Laugh it off and deny
Draw lines in the sand
And count on both hands
All the reasons why

This just won't work
It'll be nothing but hurt
I can swear that I don't
And maybe one day I won't
But for how hard I've tried

I can't unlove you
My heart can't unbreak
I can't unfeel how it felt
But feel so much myself
My whole body ached
And I can't unknow this
Lord, I wish I knew how
But I can't unlove you
So come love me for now

If I were 25
I know just what I'd do
I would have already kissed
Till I was drunk on your lips
A thousand times too few

But we have other lives
And we know it ain't right
This is going nowhere
If I'm with you I don't care
Take me nowhere tonight

They call it fire
But it feels just like drowning
Well the weight of my burning desire
Closing in all around me
I wasn't lost until you found me

And I can't unlove you
My heart can't unbreak
I can't unfeel how it felt
But feel so much myself
My whole body ached
And I can't unknow this
Lord, I wish I knew how
But I can't unlove you
So come love me for now

I can't unlove you
So come love me for now
