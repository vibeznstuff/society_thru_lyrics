I need you, I need ya, I need you,
I need ya, baby I need you, I need ya,
I need you, I need ya.

Last night was a blur but all I remember is,
Black shirt bare carrats on my wrist,
Me and a couple man rollin up in a whip,
Met a pretty young lady or should I say bitch,
Will I ever see you again?
Always lookin' for another mans riches,
Why do you do this to us men?
And that's why we call them bitches.
See I don't understand,
She wasn't with a man,
How could I leave without her number in my hand,
I went to go on facebook,
Will I get her face back,
Tryna find you is like a needle in a haystack.

I came so close,
You touched my body,
You left me standing like a statue,
Baby I need you,
I was missing yesterday,
I never took your number,
Now you're nowhere to be found,
I'm goin mad I need you,
I've been searching all over facebook,
And I can't seem to find you,
I really have to find you,
Baby I need you, I need ya, I need you, I need ya.

Last night I met a fella he made me feel so,
Oh oh oh that could mean what you want it to mean,
I went to the ladies for a sec,
Er I'll be back in five yeah,
But when I came back had he left,
I felt so alone,
He left me standing in my LBD,
And my bang bang shoes,
I was so confused.

I came so close,
You touched my body,
You left me standing like a statue,
Baby I need you,
I was missing yesterday,
I never took your number,
Now you're nowhere to be found,
I'm goin mad I need you,
I've been searching all over facebook,
And I can't seem to find you,
I really have to find you,
Init I need you.

See now I gotta find someone like you,
You ain't gonna find no-one like me,
So tell me what the hell I should do,
Will I ever find someone just like you?
I don't think so not quite like me,
Girl you're one in a million,
I'm one in a million.

Yo, what do I do I need to find you girl,
Cause you could be the one to make a change in my world
Maybe one day I'll put a ring around your finger,
You should try being with a singer,
And do you know the meaning of it's dark in jail,
Until we meet again my hearts on bail,
Wherever you are right now,
I just wanna let you know that,
Your my love.
