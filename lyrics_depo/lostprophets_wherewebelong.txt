Oh, take these storms away
Start a brand new story
I'll make it through each day
Singing death or glory
Lord won't answer me
I won't let it bring me down

And though these clouds are grey
That I'm living under
I know I'll be okay
With the rain or thunder
I hear it calling me
I will march into the sound

I just get the feeling
You're holding me down
And these answers I'm needing
I guess they're being smothered by the sound
Of all this emotion
And all of this hate
Still I keep searching for something to put my faith in
To find my place so I keep singing

Oh, take these storms away
Start a brand new story
I'll make it through each day
Singing death or glory
Lord won't answer me
I won't let it bring me down

Hold on
Hold on
And we'll move along

Where we belong
Where we belong
My heart, my song

I don't need a vision
A light to embrace
I don't need false promises, hopes and wishes
To find my place
So I keep singing

Oh, take these storms away
Start a brand new story
I'll make it through each day
Singing death or glory
Lord won't answer me
I won't let it bring me down

Where we belong
Where we belong
My heart, my soul
We stand alone

Hold on
Hold on
Where we belong
My heart, my song
We stand alone

Hold on
Hold on
Where we belong
My heart, my song
We stand alone

Hold on
Hold on
Where we belong
My heart, my soul

Oh, take these storms away
Start a brand new story
I'll make it through each day
Singing death or glory
Lord won't answer me
I won't let it bring me down
