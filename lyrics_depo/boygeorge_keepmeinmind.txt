You got, you got, you got everything
You know I'm not someone
Who likes to wait around in line
You know I'm not someone
Who likes to waste a lot of time
Love will find the answer
In every little thing you do
Love will find the answer
And it's always gonna come to you
If you just
Keep me in mind
'Cause there may not be a second time Keep me in mind
For the rest of your life
Keep me in mind
You know I'm not someone
Who likes to use words like love
You know I'm not someone
Who likes to put myself above
Keep me in mind
'Cause there may not be a second time
Keep me in mind
For the rest of your life Keep me in mind
