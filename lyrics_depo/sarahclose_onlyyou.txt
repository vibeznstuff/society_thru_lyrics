Your heartbeat bleeds on the front steps
I'm following the voice in my own head
This morning left you lying in our white bed
I don't think this is for me anymore, I said, I said

You're so heavy I can't see the skies
You're making plans and then forgetting mine
Nothing to look for now you found your treasure
And I've been asking myself when is this gonna get better?

I need a little more
Than only you, than only you
I need a little more
Than only you, than only you
Still love you like before
But all we do keeps falling through
So I need a little more
Than only you, than only you
I need a little more
I need a little more
Than only you, than only you

I move outside of the lines you draw
In colours you said we weren't meant for
And you can call me selfish for wanting more
Well it's a voice that I can't ignore, I said, I said

You're so heavy I can't see the skies
You're making plans and then forgetting mine
Nothing to look for now you found your treasure
And I've been asking myself when is this gonna get better

I need a little more
Than only you, than only you
I need a little more
Than only you, than only you
Still love you like before
But all we do keeps falling through
So I need a little more
Than only you, than only you
I need a little more
I need a little more
Than only you, than only you

All we've tried, yeah, still not right
Think we have to lose to grow
No more fights and wasted lies
Have to do this on my own

I need a little more
Than only you, than only you
I need a little more
Than only you, than only you
I need a little more
I need a little more
Than only you, than only you
Still love you like before
But all we do keeps falling through
So I need a little more
Than only you, than only you
I need a little more
Than only you, than only you
