I left my home one day for the sake of better pay
In a foreign land twelve centuries back in time
Where the sun keeps pouring down on the holes down in the ground
And I dream of the girl I left behind

Well I signed on the dotted line and I thought in a few years time
I'd be home and we could start a brand new life
But everything went wrong and I just don't know how long
They will make me stay to pay for my crime
And I wish I was

Rollin' home, rollin' home
Home to the place I long to be
Oh-oh rollin' home, rollin' home
There's someone waiting there for me

There's a law that rules this land that I just didn't understand
I didn't know that I was doing wrong
But they don't seem to care and they'll do it when they're over there
But here you face the justice of their God
And I wish I was

Rollin' home, rollin' home
Home to the place I long to be
Oh-oh rollin' home, rollin' home
There's someone waiting there for me

All the money that I saved to pay for better days
Just can't make up for how I miss you so
There's no consolation prize but when I close my eyes
I'm dreaming of you in our new home
And I wish I was

Rollin' home, rollin' home
Home to the place I long to be
Oh-oh rollin' home, rollin' home
There's someone waiting there for me

Rollin' home, rollin' home
Home to the place I long to be
Oh-oh rollin' home, rollin' home
There's someone waiting there for me
