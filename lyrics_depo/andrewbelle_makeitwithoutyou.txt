This is the starting of my greatest fear
I'm all packed up, getting out of here
But then you call and tell me not to go
That I'm the one who put the rock n roll
In your life

This is the starting of a brand new day
Never liked this town much anyway
I need this city like I need the rain
I know that somewhere there's a north bound train

Oh I'll
Make it without you
Make it without you
Though my body's laying here
It's my mouth that must be lying now

This is the starting of my fall from grace
My self esteem, oh it's seen better days
But you know I'll never let this go to waste
I'll keep this memory on the map I trace
Back to home

Friends go out, but I've been staying in
I know I should, but that's the way it's been
I never cared much for the taste of gin
Still don't now, oh, but it's been helping

Oh I'll
Make it without you
In my life
Oh I'll make it without you
Though my body's laying here
It's my mouth that must be lying now
It's my mouth that must be lying now

Oh I
Oh I'll make it without you
Oh I
Oh I'll make it without you
Oh I
Oh I'll make it without you!

Though my body's laying here
It's my mouth that must be lying now
