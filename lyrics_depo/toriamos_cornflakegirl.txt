Never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution
Hanging with the raisin girls
She's gone to the other side
Giving us a yo heave ho
Things are getting kind of gross
And I go at sleepy time
This is not really happening
You bet your life it is 

Peal out the watchword
Just peal out the watchword

She knows what's going on
Seems we got a cheaper feel now
All the sweeties are gone
Gone to the other side
With my encyclopedia
They must've paid her a nice price
She's putting on her string bean love
This is not really happening
You bet your life it is 

Peal our the watchword
Just peal out the watchword

Never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution

Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl?
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl?
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys?
Oh, yeah
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, where'd you put the keys, girl

And the man with the golden gun thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much yeah
(Don't close this door I know it's so easy)
And the man with the golden gun thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much yeah
(To close this door I know it's so easy)

Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl?
Oh yes, rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl?
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys?
Oh yeah
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl?
