Don't be surprised by the way that I am
By the way that I feel and I act
There's too many rules, I really can't choose
I can't let those chains hold me back

I've never known what it's like on my own
But I'm taking a chance anyway
It may not be right, like some moves in the night
But I've got to do it my way

I want my independence
I want my freedom right now
I want my independence (independence)
I want my freedom right now

So what you're saying don't matter to me
I'm making my plans all alone
But I've got the right to express my emotions
Have some space of my own

Don't be confused, please, don't misunderstand
I can't respect your wishes more
This time, I must say I want it my way
I'm walking out the door

I want my independence (independence) ooh
I want my freedom (freedom) right now
I want my independence (independence)
I want my freedom, my freedom now

This time, I walk away (this time)
This time, I'm on my own
This time, I walk away (this time)
This time, I'm on my own

Don't be confused, please, don't misunderstand
I can't respect your wishes more
And this time, I must say I want it my way
I'm walking through the door

I want my independence (independence)
I want my freedom (freedom) right now, yeah
I want my independence (independence)
I want my freedom (freedom), my freedom now

This time, I walk away yeah (freedom)
This time, I'm on my own (independence)
This time, I walk away (freedom)
This time, I'm on my own (independence)

Baby, I want my freedom, yeah yeah
I want my independence
I want my freedom, my freedom, my freedom, my freedom
Oh (independence) oh oh independence (freedom)
I want my freedom, baby, yeah yeah (independence)
I want my independence (freedom)
And I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
(Independence)
