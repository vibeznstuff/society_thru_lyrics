People always talk about (ey oh ey oh ey oh)
All the things they're all about (ey oh ey oh ey oh)
Write it on a piece of paper,
Got a feeling I'll see you later.

There's something bout this,
Lets keep it moving,
And if its good lets just get something cooking.
Cause I really wanna rock with you,
I'm feeling some connection to the things you do.
(you do, you do).


I don't know what it is,
That makes me feel like this,
I don't know who you are,
But you must be some kind of superstar,
Cause you got all eyes on you no matter where you are,
(you just make me wanna dance)

Baby take a look around (ey oh ey oh ey oh)
Everybody's getting down (ey oh ey oh ey oh)
Deal with all the problems later,
Bad boys on their best behaviour.

There's something bout you,
Lets keep it moving,
And if it's good lets just get something cooking,
Cause I really wanna rock with you,
I'm feeling some connection to the things you do,
(you do, you do).

I don't know what it is,
That makes me feel like this,
I don't know who you are,
But you must be some kind of superstar,
Cause you got all eyes on you no matter where you are,
(you just make me wanna dance).

I like the way your movin' (ey oh ey oh ey oh)
I just get into the groove and then (you just make me wanna play),
If you just put pen to paper (ey oh ey oh ey oh)
Got that feeling I'll see you later.

Make your move, can we get a little closer,
You rock it just like you're supposed to,
Hey boy I ain't got nothing more to say,
Cause you just make me wanna play,

I don't know what it is,
That makes me feel like this,
I don't know,
Gotta be, gotta be a superstar,
All eyes on you.
