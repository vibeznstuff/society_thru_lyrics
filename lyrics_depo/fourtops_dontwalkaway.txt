Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Not now that I'm inspired
Oh won't you stay
Please won't you stay
Come on girl
Come around now

Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Not now that I'm inspired
Oh won't you stay
Please won't you stay
Your love it takes me higher

You built me up
Make me feel I was good enough
To be your guy
Now you've changed your mind girl

Couldn't decide
If your love was all in my mind
But in my heart too
I believe in you

Not now that I'm inspired
Oh won't you stay
Please won't you stay
Come on girl
Come around now

Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Not now that I'm inspired
Oh won't you stay
Please won't you stay
Your love it takes me higher

Don't let me down
Promise me you'll be around
I'll take the lie
Just say that you'll try girl

Over the year
I've cried twenty million tears
But in one day you washed them all away yeah

If I ever get another chance
I'm gonna get you really gonna love you
We can start a new romance
Say you'll be mine girl

Don't you walk away
Don't turn your back on me
Don't walk away girl
Don't walk away girl
Don't you walk away
Don't you walk away
Hey girl

Listen to me girl
Don't turn your back on me
Now that you got me inspired
Don't you walk away
Don't you walk away

Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Not now that I'm inspired
Oh won't you stay
Please won't you stay
Come on girl
Come around now

Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Not now that I'm inspired
Oh won't you stay
Please won't you stay
Your love it takes me higher
