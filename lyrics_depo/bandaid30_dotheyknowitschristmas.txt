It's Christmas time, there's no need to be afraid


At Christmas time, we let in light and we banish shade


And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy


Throw your arms around the world at Christmas time


But say a prayer and pray for the other ones


At Christmas time it's hard but while you’re having fun


There’s a world outside your window and it’s a world of dread and fear


Where a kiss of love can kill you


Where there’s death in every tear


And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom


Well, tonight we’re reaching out and touching you


Bring peace and joy this Christmas to West Africa


A song of hope where there’s no hope tonight


Why is comfort to be feared, why is to touch to be scared?


How can they know it’s Christmas time at all?


Here’s to you


Raise a glass to everyone


Here’s to them


And all there is to come


Can they know it’s Christmas time at all?
