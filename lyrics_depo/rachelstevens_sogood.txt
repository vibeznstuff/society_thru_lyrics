I get this feeling that you're taking me under
I get this feeling that you're taking it down
'Cause it's you, you, you, all you
Come and get it

I start to see the way you're taking me over
My eyes are open to you fooling around
'Cause it's you, you, you, all you
Come and get it
Gonna show ya

I made it on my own again
I'll get back on my feet again
I know I'm gonna feel
So good, and so good, and so good
I'm gonna stand the test of time
I'm gonna take back what is mine
I know I'm gonna feel
So good, and so good, and so good

Well you've been acting like you're seeing another
Another victim that you've caught in your web
'Cause it's you, you, you, all you
Come and get it

I'd like to watch you suffer ever so slightly
You better watch your back, you better beware
'Cause it's you, you, you, all you
Come and get it
Gonna show ya

I made it on my own again
I'll get back on my feet again
I know I'm gonna feel
So good, and so good, and so good
I'm gonna stand the test of time
I'm gonna take back what is mine
I know I'm gonna feel
So good, and so good, and so good

I'm feeling so good
I'm feeling so good
So good
So good

I made it on my own again
I'll get back on my feet again
I know I'm gonna feel
So good, and so good, and so good
I'm gonna stand the test of time
I'm gonna take back what is mine
I know I'm gonna feel
So good, and so good, and so good
