In coats of many colour
Reptile man drop
Stay below it
Stay below it
Stay below it
Stay below it
Temperature drop

America's a boyfriend
Untouched by flesh of hand
Heartbeat under
Heartbeat under
Heartbeat under
Heartbeat under
Some promised land

Love song
Love song
Love song
Love song

On and on and

On and on and

Flesh of heart
Heart of steel
So well so well
I cut my hair
Paint my face
Break a finger
Tell a lie
So well so well

America's a boyfriend
Untouched by flesh of hand
Stay below it
Stay below
In glory days that come and go
Some promised land

Love song
Love song
Love song
Love song

And on and on and
On and on and
On and on and

Stay below
Shout below
Flesh of heart
Heart of steel
Flesh of heart
Heart of steel
Flesh of heart
Heart of steel
Flesh of heart
Heart of steel
Love song
Love song
Love song
And love song

Stay below
Shout below
In glory days that come and go
Stay below
Shout below
In glory days that come and go

Love song
Love song
Love song
On and on and
On and on and
On and on and
And on and on and
