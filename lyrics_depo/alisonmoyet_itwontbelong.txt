One of these days
I'm waiting on a day
When nobody comes to trample my meadow
Biding my time
There's gonna be a time
Might take a while
But changes are coming 
And it wont be long
When everything you said
Won't sit around and pile up with the traffic in my head
And when I wake up
I wont see you on the bathroom floor
In the tangle of clothes we left lying there
It wont be long

One of these nights
With company I find
I wont be inclined to leave before sunrise
When my eyes, my mouth, my hands, my head
Don't tell me that nobody else will do

And it wont be long
When everything you said
Won't sit around and pile up with the traffic in my head
And when I wake up
I wont see you on the bedroom floor
In the tangle of rope we left lying there
It wont be long
It wont be long
'Till it's all gone

And it wont be long
When everything you said
Won't sit around and pile up with the traffic in my head
And when I wake up
I wont see you by the bedroom door
In the wallpaper stained by the cup that I threw at your head
It wont be long
