I get tired and upset
And I'm trying to care a little less
When I google I only get depressed
I was taught to dodge those issues
I was told

Don't worry, cos no doubt
There's always something to cry about
When you're stuck in an angry crowd
They don't think what they say
Before they open their mouth

You gotta
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And bury them beneath the sea
I don't care what the people may say
What the people may say about me

Pack up your troubles, get your old grin back
Don't worry about the cavalry
I don't care what the whisperers say
'Cause they whisper too loud for me

Hot topic
Maybe I should drop it
It's a touchy subject
And I like to tiptoe 'round
The ship going down

We got pennies and no pounds
So if your business is running out
It's not my business to talk about
They don't think what they say
Before they open their mouth

You gotta
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And bury them beneath the sea
I don't care what the people may say
What the people may say about me

Pack up your troubles, get your old grin back
Don't worry about the cavalry
I don't care what the whisperers say
'Cause they whisper too loud for me

Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And bury them beneath the sea
I don't care what the people may say
What the people may say about me

Pack up your troubles, get your old grin back
Don't worry about the cavalry
I don't care what the whisperers say
'Cause they whisper too loud for me

Yeah, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Yeah, eh, eh, eh
