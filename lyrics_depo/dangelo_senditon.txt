Send it up

Your inner view to me is
Something that I do desire
Struggling 2 see a new something that I fantasize
So I'm sending

U can't disguise your emotions
U know that I see in your eyes
U soul's ME, your soul's somethin' that I feel inside
Run, run, run, run if I run Lord only knows how far 
That I and I will fall behind
Gotta find a better place, gotta find a better space
So that I, so my life may be the reason why

Hold on be strong, 4 your own
Move on b4 long, you'll get home
If your feeling insecure
U can be sure
Even if it take forever and a day for me 2 do
I gotta send it on TO U
Tell me what will I do
Send it right back 2 U
