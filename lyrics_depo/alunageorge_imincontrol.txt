I'm in control


I like crashing waves
But I want to see them at first light
After a long night
And see the sky take shape
But I want to see the stars burn
After I've had my turn


And ooh, ooh
You're working so hard
You played your card
So what's the payoff?
And ooh, ooh
Big talk is cheap
You gotta go deeper than deep
To get me off


If you're picking up my call
Come and tell your boss you know that I'm in control
I'm in control
Don't you know I want it all?
Put your hands against the wall
I'm in control, I'm in control
I'm in control


She tell me she in control of me love
Gyal get fucked up when me turn on up
Boy, now she guh start whine up
Love how she smile when we run, tied up
Baby full o' action like Twilight
Ah, yuh not dead like nine night gyal
Bubble like champagne or Sprite, gyal
All night, me a give ya love


And ooh, ooh
You're working so hard
You played your card
So what's the payoff?
And ooh, ooh
Big talk is cheap
You gotta go deeper than deep
To get me off


If you're picking up my call
Come and tell your boss you know that I'm in control
I'm in control
Don't you know I want it all?
Put your hands against the wall
I'm in control, I'm in control
I'm in control
(All night, me a give you love
Control of me love)
I'm in control


Hey gal

Cause tonight me a take off your shorts
And me feel up the fat pum pum inna yuh drawers
Whole night, me a watch ya inna the dance
Oh God, me a pray for your legs like a fast
Gyal, yuh no favor, nuh Halloween mask

(I'm in control)


If you're picking up my call
Come and tell your boss you know that
(Cause she in control of me love)
I'm in control
Don't you know I want it all?
Put your hands against the wall
(Cause she in control of me love)
I'm in control
