Huh, somebody call the popo (popo)
Cause the way that you looking is so cold (so cold)
If you ain't ready then you need to go home
Everywhere I can see her rolling on the solo (solo)
She got me begging, hold on (hold on)
And she all up on me like a logo (logo)
But I'm not complaining, my baby, let's go go go

She kill 'em with a dance
She murder with her waist
Everybody watching when she turn up in the place
You ain't got a chance if you really tryna race
She already at the finish line with her pace
And shawty went down then she went low
Gave it to her badder that she in a relay
The craziest thing is she don't know
How beautiful she is everyday
