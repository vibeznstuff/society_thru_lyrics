We do what we have to when we fall in love.
We say what we need to get out when it's not enough.
Whether it's to yourself, or lookin' at someone else. 

Everybody lies, lies, lies.  
It's the only truth sometimes.  
Doesn't matter if it's out there somewhere waiting for the world to find.
Or buried deep inside. Everybody lies. 

Just being honest, we're playing for both sides.
It's easy to decieve but it's hard when the trust that's broken is mine.
For better, or for worse, for the happy, for the hurt. 

Everybody lies, lies, lies.  
It's the only truth sometimes.  
Doesn't matter if it's out there somewhere waiting for the world to find.
Or buried deep inside. Yeah, everybody lies. 

Everybody lives, and everybody dies.
Yeah.
Oh it doesn't matter if it's out there somewhere 
Waiting for the world to find.
Or buried deep inside. Or buried deep inside. 
Everybody lies.
