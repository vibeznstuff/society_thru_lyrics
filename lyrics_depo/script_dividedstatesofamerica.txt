Divided States of America
Divided States of the World
If we don't all stand together
We will fall
Divided States of America
Divided States of the World
If we don't all stand together
We will fall

How many miles must I walk in your shoes
'Fore I know how you feel, know how you feelin'?
How many times must I see you on the news
'Fore I know it's for real, know it's for real?
And how many nights must I hear you sing the blues?
Another gun man running on the loose
How many times must I turn a blind eye
And deny what I'm seeing, deny what I'm seeing?

Another protest to another march
Incite a riot, boy - ready, set, charge
Another gun fest, drop another bomb
Another war child, tell me, what the fuck is going on?
Another scandal from the man in charge
Another white collar criminal at large
We're waking up, we're catching on
We've had enough, we're standing strong

Divided States of America
Divided States of the World
If we don't all stand together
We will fall
Divided States of America
Divided States of the World
If we don't all stand together
We will fall

'Cause they built these walls so high
Let's reach across that great divide

How many crimes do we have to live through
'Fore we start intervening, start intervening?
How many lives are we going to lose
'Fore we lost all the meaning, lost all the meaning?

Another battleground to another war
Another time to speak less, listen more
We're waking up, we're catching on
We've had enough, we're standing strong

Divided States of America
Divided States of the World
If we don't all stand together
We will fall
Divided States of America
Divided States of the World
If we don't all stand together
We will fall

'Cause they built these walls so high
Let's reach across that great divide
'Cause they built these walls so high
Let's reach across that great divide

Brick by brick, stone by stone
Let's tear this down until it's gone
Until it's gone, until it's gone
Brick by brick, stone by stone
Let's build the bridge to get us home
We're not alone, we're not alone
Yeah (we're not alone)

Divided States of America
Divided States of the World
If we don't all stand together
We will fall
Divided States of America
Divided States of the World
If we don't all stand together
We will fall

'Cause they built these walls so high
Let's reach across that great divide
'Cause they built these walls so high
Let's reach across that great divide
