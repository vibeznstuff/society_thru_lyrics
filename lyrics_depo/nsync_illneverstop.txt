Oh yeah
I'll
I'll never stop

I don't know
Do you believe me?
After all that's said and done
All the lies
How I regret them baby now
I am the loser
And you're shining like the sun
Tell me why can't I still be the one?
Alright


I will never stop, until you're mine
I can wait forever till the end of time
Cause my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand?
I'll never stop

I'll never stop

How could I ever
When my heart is in your hands?
And I know
Baby there is no turning back
You say that I'm crazy
And I kind of understand
How I wish for this nightmare to end
Oh yeah

I will never stop until you're mine
I can wait forever till the end of time
Cause my heart is your hands
Don't you understand?
I'll never stop

Yeaa
I'll never stop

Oh...

Do you believe me
When my heart is in your hands?
Don't you understand?
I will never stop (I'll never stop)
Till the end of time (I can wait forever)
My heart is, in your, hand (My heart is in your hand)
I will never stop
Until you're mine
I can wait forever till the end of time
Cause my heart is in your hands
