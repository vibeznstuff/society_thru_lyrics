Wanted to be on a stage
Where bright lights shine
On me at Carnegie
Polished up my act
Knew the crowds would see I had the knack
And that's a fact
Glamour and fame
Wasn't much more than a crazy game
I had to play
Now I got my wish
I don't know if I can handle this
But I think I'm gonna win
I'm in the Big Time, Big Time
And I know success is all mine, all mine
Big Time, Big Time
Gonna have the best of time
So now I'm there and an agent handles my career,
Star of the Year
Following the steps of the best
Of Broadway East and West,
I passed the test
It's all too much
With the interviews, reviews and such
I'm very touched
And it blows my mind
All the autographs I have to sign
And there's so little time
I'm in the Big Time, Big Time
And I know success is all mine, all mine
Big Time, Big Time
Gonna have the best of time
I was born to funk
I was born to funk and roll
In the Big Time
