It's in your eyes,
the love you hide away.
You can't disguise
the things you feel, the thing you say

If you just call my name
any time at all, I'll be there.

I don't know why,
the way you're falling away from me.
I can't describe
it's how it feels, it's what I see.

If you just call my name
anytime at all,
anytime at all,
anytime at all, I'll be there.

I look around, all I see is you
but you gotta tell me that you want me too.
Look at me, you're all that I need, it's true.

I'm here, just call my name
anytime at all, I'll be there.

I look around, all I see is you
but you gotta tell me that you want me too.
Look at me, you're all that I need, it's true.

I can't disguise
the love I wait for you to share
I can't deny
if you reach out and touch my hand it's there.

Or just call my name,
anytime at all,
anytime at all,
anytime at all, I'll be there.
