Baby don't go
You've nearly shown everything you are to me
Darling don't stray stay here with me 
Because that's how it ought to be
You've come this far to see who you are
See the love inside yourself
So don't be afraid I'm holding your hand
Just let the love run freely through me

You're so tangled up in love
Searching for your soul, searching for yourself
So tangled up in love
That you can't see anything else

My oh my
Do I have to tell you how to live your life
Ooh baby don't you know, now that your mine
You've got to set your loving free

My oh my
Do I have to tell you how to live your life
Ooh baby don't you know, now that your mine
You've got to set your loving free

Tell me you see all we can be
That we can be magical
Throw off your pride and show me inside
Show me what your frightened of

You're so tangled up in love
Searching for your soul, searching for yourself
So tangled up in love
That you can't see anything else

My oh my
Do I have to tell you how to live your life
Ooh baby don't you know, now that your mine
You've got to set your loving free

You're so tangled up in love
Searching for your soul, searching for yourself
So tangled up in love
That you can't see anything else

My oh my
Do I have to tell you how to live your life
Ooh baby don't you know, now that your mine
You've got to set your loving free
