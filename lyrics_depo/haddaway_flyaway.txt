It's a dream of worlds in motion
(and) another place and time
I guess I'm feeling lost in
The home I thought was mine
It's a universal
Life is just a battlefield
Open your heart for someone
Nothing is Revealed
Fly away you can leave it all behind you

I'm on my way to find you
And I'll soon be flying too
fly away we can fly away together
I'm talking about forever
This is all we gotta do
Fly away...

It's a tangled up emotion
Will you stay or will you go
I am the one to count on
If only you could know
