Every man has a place
In his heart there's a space
And the world can't erase his fantasies

Take a ride in the sky
On our ship fantasize
All your dreams will come true right away

And we will live together
Until the twelfth of never 
Our voices will ring forever as one

Come to see victory
In a land called fantasy
Loving life for you and me
To behold to your soul is ecstasy 

You will find other kind
That has been in search of you
Many lives has brought you to recognize
It's your life now in review

Every thought is a dream
Rushing by in a stream
Bringing life to your kingdom of doing

Take a ride in the sky 
On our ship fantasize 
All your dreams will come true miles away 

Our voices will ring together 
Until the twelfth of never 
We all will live on forever as one

Come to see victory
In the land of fantasy
Loving life a new decree
Bring your mind to everlasting liberty

As you stay for the play 
Fantasy has in store for you
Glowing light will see you through
It's your day, shining day
All your dreams come true 

As you glide in your stride 
With the wind as you fly away 
Give a smile from your lips and say 
I am free, yes I'm free
Now I'm on my way
