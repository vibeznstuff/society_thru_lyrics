Now, I found, that the world is round
and of course it rains everyday.

Living tomorrow, where in the world will I be tomorrow?
How far am I able to see?
Or am I needed here?



If I remember all of the things I have done,
I'd remember all of the times I've gone wrong.
Why do they keep me here?


And 
And 
And
