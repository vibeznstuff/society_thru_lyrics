Well you’re walkin and a talkin 
And a movin and a groovin
And a hippin and a hoppin
And a pickin and a boppin
Those bods are being bad 
You better take a stand 
You gonna wake up that thing in your hand
You’re looking all around 
There is trouble to be found 
Make sure when you find it you get to say it loud
Gotta code three 
Need back up
Bring me
My bright red fluro jacket


He’s fat and he don’t run too fast
But he’s faster than me
Last night at the show we saw him
Going out of his tree

Well you’re walkin and a talkin
You’re my walkie talkie man 
Well you’re walkin and a talkin
Go Go Go Go


Well you’re walkin and a talkin
And a freakin and a yellin
And a bossin and a speakin
And a lookin and a pointin
Always tell us what to do 
With your high top shoes 
And you wave your torch 
With your black short shorts
Don’t let em get away
Don’t think they can play  
Nail ‘em to the wall 
Cause you really need to say
Gotta code three
Need back up
Bring me
My bright red fluro jacket
