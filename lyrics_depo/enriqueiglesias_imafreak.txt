Mr. Worldwide
Let's go!

I tried to let it go,
But I'm addicted to your chemicals
I got a taste, I want an overdose
I love the way she gets so physical
Fucks like an animal

Day and night I just imagine how you put your love on me
Lights off, lights on
Ready for some action
Baby, come and give it to me

'Cause I'm a freak
The way you pop it and drop it
All over me
No, I don't want you to stop it
Yeah, I'm a freak
Baby, I can't lie
When you move like that
I've got a one track mind,

'Cause I'm a freak
Yeah, I'm a freak
'Cause I'm a freak
Yeah, I'm a freak

Yeah, baby there you go (let's go)
Stealing my heart just like a criminal
No turning back, this time is critical
Ya' move your body like a miracle
Baby, here we go

Day and night I just imagine how you put your love on me
Lights off, lights on
Ready for some action
Baby, come and give it to me

'Cause I'm a freak
The way you pop it and drop it
All over me
No, I don't want you to stop it
Yeah, I'm a freak
Baby, I can't lie
When you move like that
I've got one track mind

'Cause I'm a freak
Yeah, I'm a freak
'Cause I'm a freak
Yeah, I'm a freak


Baby you pop it and lock it
Drop it, I watch it for sure
Baby you roll it and rock it
Move it, I use it, let's go
You know I lick it and do the things that'll make you explode
You don't believe me, mami, just let-let-let-let me go low
Because I'm a freak-freak-freak-freak-freak-freak-freak-freak,
Yea' that's you know
Now can I get a beat-beat-beat-beat-beat-beat,
Baby back it up nice and slow
I just wanna skeet-skeet-skeet-skeet-skeet-skeet-skeet-skeet,
Right out and go
I came, I saw, I conquered, off to the next, let's go

Yeah I'm a freak
The way you pop it and drop it
All over me
No, I don't want you to stop it
Yeah, I'm a freak
Baby, I can't lie
When you move like that
I've got a one track mind

'Cause I'm a freak
Yeah, I'm a freak
'Cause I'm a freak
Yeah, I'm a freak

It's The Cataracs

From the hotel room to the DJ booth
On the bathroom sink, yes, I'm just a freak
And when the sun goes down, gotta let it out
Baby don't blame me,
I'm-I'm just a freak!
