God knows that you're a sexy thang 
It's taking everything in me 
Not to kiss you over under 
Feel your inside feel my thunder 
How the hell could I not want you 


Girl you don't have to be a thang 
I'll wait for you, You wait for me (baby) 
Cuz true love's insisting 
We don't have to rush at all (baby yeah) 


These are the times we all wish for 
The moment when less means so much more 
We don't have to do a thing at all 
We can take our time and talk 
And this is the way things need to be 
No pressure from you and none from me 
Just let the mood set the moment off 
We can make love or not at all 


Been thinking bout you all the time 
Morning noon and supper time 
Tear you up in little pieces 
Swallow you like reeses pieces 
Come on girl you know I need it 


(I know) It aint suppose to be a thing 

(I know) I'll wait for you, you wait for me 

(And I know) Cuz true love's insisting we don't have to rush at at all 




I don't make promises 
Cuz I know my heart gets weak 
When I get around you girl 
It makes them hard to keep 
Cuz you bring out the best 
Make me the man 
God knows I'm proud to be (Baby yeah)
