There you were freaking out,
Trying to get your head around the fact that me and you and love is dead
See how I'm trippin out
'cause you can't decide what you really want from me

Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
You make me love you, love you baby
With a little L

There you were shouting out
Cranking up your altercations, getting upset in your desperation
Screaming and hollering
How could this love become so paper thin?

You're playing so hard to get
You're making me sweat just to hold your attention
I can't give you nothing more
If you ain't givin' nothing to me

Don't you know that

you make me love you, love you baby
with a little L
why does it have to be like this
I can never tell

Seems like you're stepping on the pieces
of my broken shell
'cause you make me love you, love you
with a little L you know
that's the way you make me love you yeah

Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
You make me love you, love you baby
With a little L.
