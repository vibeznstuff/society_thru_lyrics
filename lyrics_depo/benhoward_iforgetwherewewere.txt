Oh, hey
I wasn't listening
I was watching Syria blinded by the sunshine strip
And you, you were in the kitchen
Oh, your mariner's mouth 
The wounded with the wounder's whip

And that's how summer passed oh
The great dividing range of green, green grass
Oh, maybe it was peace at last, who knew

Hello love, my invincible friend
Hello love, the thistle and the burr
Hello love, for you I have so many words
But I, I forget where we were

Oh, hey
I wasn't listening
I was stung by all of us
The blind leading out the bored
And as per usual
You were skipping and laughing eyes at the bedroom door
"Don't take it so seriously, no
Only time is ours, the rest we'll just wait and see!"
Maybe you're right, babe, maybe

Oh, no, and that's how summer passed
Oh the great dividing range, the green green grass
And, oh, maybe I hold on fast to you

Hello love, my invincible friend
Hello love, the thistle and the burr
Hello love, for you I have so many words
But I, I forget where we were

I, I forget where we were
I forget where we were
I forget where we were

Oh, no, and that's how summer passed
Oh, your, great dividing range, the green green grass
Oh, maybe it was peace at last, who knew
