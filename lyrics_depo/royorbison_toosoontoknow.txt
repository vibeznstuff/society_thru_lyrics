It's too soon to know if I can forget her 
My heart's been broken in too many pieces 
And It's too soon to know 

Time passes slow will I ever know 
If I can forget her  and not let it show 
But it's too soon to know 

News travels fast when a love affair ends 
People keep asking what happened to them 

But it's too soon to know it I can forget her 
My heart's been broken in too many pieces 
And It's too soon to know 
My heart's been broken in too many pieces 
And It's too soon to know
