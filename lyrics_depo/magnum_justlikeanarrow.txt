We talk endlessly
Don't get anywhere
Born in reality
Cradled in care
If you needed me
Or mistreated me
Won't you still be there?

And those lonely nights
When you find it hard
Losing your appetite
Breaking apart
If you needed me
Or mistreated me
Don't break my heart

It goes deep, my love, only for you
Just like an arrow
It goes deep, my love, only for you
Just like an arrow
Just like an arrow
Straight through your heart

We talk endlessly
Don't get anywhere
Born in reality
Cradled in care
If you needed me
Or mistreated me
Won't you still be there?
Please be there

And those lonely nights
When you find it hard
Losing your appetite
Breaking apart
If you needed me
Or mistreated me
Don't break my heart
Don't you break it

It goes deep, my love, only for you
Just like an arrow
It goes deep, my love, only for you
Just like an arrow
Just like an arrow

It goes deep, my love, only for you
Just like an arrow
It goes deep, my love, only for you
Just like an arrow
Just like an arrow
Straight through your heart
