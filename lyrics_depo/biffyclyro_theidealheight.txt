You've opened the door to reason, without invitation
Forget what you had, it's vanished - except for the minions
But we'll scratch away to find the ideal height
How well do you think that you know me? I'll tell you now, I didn't even mean it
Circumstance predicts I, slim the main
We hope that you don't remember instructions of heaven
Cos' everyone has a purpose, even the minions
But we'll scratch away to find the ideal height
How well do you think that you know me? I'll tell you now, I didn't even mean it
Circumstance depicts I, slim the main...make the strain go away!
