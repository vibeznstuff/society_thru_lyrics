Short and sweet
No sense in dragging on past our needs
Let's don't keep it hanging on
If the fire's out, we should both be gone
Some people are made for each other

Some people can love one another for life
How 'bout us?
Some people can hold it together

Last through all kinds of weather, can we?
Now don't you get me wrong
'Cause I'm not trying now to end it all
It's just that I have seen
Too many lovers' hearts lose their dream
Some people are made for each other

How 'bout us
How 'bout us
Baby?
How 'bout us
How 'bout us
Baby?
How 'bout us
How 'bout us
Baby?

Are we gonna make it
Girl

Or are we gonna drift and drift and drift?
Some people are made for each other

How 'bout us
Baby?
Some people are made for each other

How 'bout us
Baby?
