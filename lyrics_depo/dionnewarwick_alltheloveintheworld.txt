In your eyes I see only one - find me the place for us
That's where I belong. There we rise - your blory and mine.
Your pain is over now
I make you shine - still believing:
All the love in the world won't take me away from you

My love is stronger I am what you make me.
All the love in the world won't take you away from me

In all my wonder I forever lay down here with you.
I find when love slips away
reach out for all you can
Before it's too late
there you fly returnin' to me

Out of your darkest nights I stand alone - still believing:
All the love in the world won't take me away from you

My love is stronger I forever lay down here with you.
My love is true
all your darkest nights - I stand alone - still believing:
All the love in the world won't take me away from you

My love is stronger I forever lay down here with you.
All the love in the world won't take me away from you
