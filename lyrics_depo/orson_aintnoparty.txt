Oh, next light bust a right.
It's not gonna be too hard.
If there's no parking on the street pull up on the front yard.
Don't bring no vodka, or whiskey,
we've got everything you need.
Just bring a pair of your dancing shoes and get down to this beat.

Let's go down.
Wash that sugar down.
You gotta realize that.
Because there ain't no party
like the party going on in my house.
Better believe that it's gonna be the biggest night of the year.
Because there ain't no party
like the party going on in my house,
but it would be so much better if you were only here.
Mmmm, oh,
that's right.
Mmmm,
prom night, oscar night, got all that BS beat.

There's twenty girls for every single boy
and they're crazy from this heat.
We'll take you up and down and everywhere in between.
Mom and Dad are out of town all week,
so you better get on your feet.

Let's go down.
Wash that sugar down.
Because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house.
Better believe that it's gonna be the biggest night of the year,
because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house,
but it would be so much better if you were only here. Mmmm.

Everything you ever wanted from this life is gonna happen right now.
Oooh, those girls tend to hide,
and the temperatures rise,
better reach for the sky and raise up the ceiling...

Because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house.
Better believe that it's gonna be the biggest night of the year.
Because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house,
but it would be so much better if you were only here.
If only you were here.
