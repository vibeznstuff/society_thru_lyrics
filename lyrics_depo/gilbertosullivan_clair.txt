Clair
The moment I met you, I swear
I felt as if something, somewhere
Had happened to me
Which I couldn't see
And then
The moment I met you again
I knew in my heart that we were friends
It had to be so
It couldn't be no
But try 
As hard as I might do, I don't know why
You get to me in a way I can't describe
Words mean so little when you look up and smile
I don't care what people say, to me you're more than a child
Oh, Clair
Clair

Clair
If ever a moment so rare 
Was captured for all to compare
That moment is you 
In all that you do
But why
In spite of our age difference do I cry
Each time I leave you I feel I could die
Nothing means more to me than hearing you say
"I'm going to marry you, will you marry me, Uncle Ray?"  
Oh, Clair
Clair

Clair
I've told you before, don't you dare
Get back into bed
Can't you see that it's late
No you can't have a drink
Oh all right then, but wait just a bit
While I, in an effort to babysit
Catch of my breath what there is left of it
You can be murder at this hour of the day
But in the morning this hour will seem a lifetime away
Oh, Clair  
Clair
Oh, Clair
