I know you're down again and you see nothing but rain.
You put your friends through hell and that's why we get along so well.
You see, I always was your girl, it always will be you and me against the world.
We know the years can give romance to the street where we once lived.
You wondered why no one called - between you and me, we scared them all.
You see, I always was your girl, it always has been you and me against the world.
Maybe we're wrong and the world is right but don't tell me that tonight. 
Self-assured and abusing guests, that's the way I like you best.
You see, I always was your girl, it always will be you and me against the world.
