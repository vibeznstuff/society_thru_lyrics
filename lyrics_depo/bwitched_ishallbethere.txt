Awaken, breathe
Hear the calling in the wind
The voice, it's saying
A journey must begin

We'll fly like a bird
In a scattered cloudy sky
Leave aside the city worries
It's just a minute away

In my heart I'll paint a picture
And I swear it's where I'll be, oh

I shall be there
Will you be there?
I shall be there
Will you be there too?

Come and look in silence
Believe in what you see
In a place like this
The starry skies can move the mountains
The sun will warm the sea

In my heart I'll paint a picture
And I swear it's where I'll be, oh

I shall be there
Will you be there?
I shall be there
Will you be there too?

I shall be there
We will be, we will be

I shall be there
Will you be there?
I shall be there
Will you be there?

I shall be there
Will you be there?
I shall be there
Will you be there?

I shall be there
