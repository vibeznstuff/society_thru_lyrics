I was falling through my sleep all night
In a dream I could be with you
Out of nowhere your guiding light shone through
My world keeps turning tearing me apart
Since you've gone all I want is you
How did we never see this was meant to be?
It's true

I wanna tell the world and shout it out
That what we have is real
I know that this is what it's all about
Cos I feel

That everybody
Needs somebody to love
(Be the one tonight)
Just anybody
Won't shine the light that burns
Only you are right
I can't imagine how my life would be
If I spent it without you
Cos everybody needs somebody to love
And I want you

Time together slipping through my hands
Stop it all cos I want more
You are the answer just too far away
You are what my life is for

I wanna tell the world and shout it out
That what we have is real
I know that this is what it's all about
Cos I feel

That everybody
Needs somebody to love
(Be the one tonight)
Just anybody
Won't shine the light that burns
Only you are right
I can't imagine how my life would be
If I spent it without you
Cos everybody needs somebody to love
And I want you

I wanna tell the world and shout it out
That what we have is real
I know that this is what it's all about
Cos I feel

That everybody
Needs somebody to love
(Be the one tonight)
Just anybody
Won't shine the light that burns
Only you are right
I can't imagine how my life would be
If I spent it without you
Cos everybody needs somebody to love
And I want you

That everybody
Needs somebody to love
(Be the one tonight)
Just anybody
Won't shine the light that burns
Only you are right
I can't imagine how my life would be
If I spent it without you
Cos everybody needs somebody to love
And I want you
