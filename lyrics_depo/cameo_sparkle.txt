Oohhoo 
When I first saw you 
You had sparkle in your eye 
Like the starts at night 
High in the sky 

How I wish 
That you were mine 
'Cause to me 
You're one of a kind 

When I look at you 
It seems so untrue 
How someone like you 
Can make me feel the way you do 

Sparkle in your eye (I) 
Sparkle in your eye (I see that sparkle in your eye) 
Sparkle in your eye (Ohohohwhoaha) 

You're so fine 
For all the world to see 
I find you hard to believe, you see 
(You're so beautiful, yeah, yeah) 
You make me want to love you (Yeah, yeah) 
Oohhoo 

When I look at you (When I look at you) 
It seems so untrue 
How someone just like you 

Your eye 
Sparkle in your eye (When I look at you I see) 
Sparkle in your eye (Heyheyheyyeah) 

Ha 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah, ha (Ah, ha) 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah, ha 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah, ha (Ah, ha) 
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Sparkle, sparkle) 

(Baby, baby) Sparkle in your eye (Baby, baby) 
Sparkle in your eye (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 
Sparkle in your eye (Ow, ow, baby)
