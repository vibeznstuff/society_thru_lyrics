I rhyme rhyme, that's why I shine shine,
And you can roll anyone of my shows,
No lights in my bag no eye sight
I gotta keep on ryhmin' man,
So I keep on shinin' man
I ain't gonna be a one hit wonder,
I am forever, call me diamond man,

I've been talkin' 'bout my new diamond rings
Because my new diamond rings they're the shit
Oh oh oh you've been talkin' 'bout my new diamond rings
Because my new diamond rings,
They're what's in
And if you're looking at me,
You gon' be looking at them
'Cause there the swagger that you see in my walk
And if you're listening to me,
You gon' be listening to them
'Cause they're the slick that you hear in my talk

Hit me one screen, West End
(flawless) shine like I'm a girl's best friend (diamonds)
Girls see me and scream 'cause I'm on the tv,
But I still take walks in my ends
14 when I entered the game
All I wanted was a little bit of fame (just a bit)
And now I'm f*ckin with the grown-ups
Go mad like sh*t I forgot my age
Oh Chipmunk you're so cute
Imma call you the diamond dude
And my rings got so many carrats
And you usually call this rabbit food
And the sales is custom made
No water involved I pay
Good lord I remember the days
I pray for roland cartier

I've been talkin' 'bout my new diamond rings
Because my new diamond rings they're the shit
Oh oh oh you've been talkin bout my new diamond rings
Because my new diamond rings,
They're whats in
And if you're looking at me,
You gon' be looking at them
'Cause there the swagger that you see in my walk
And if your listening to me,
You gon' be listening to them
'Cause there the slik that you hear in my talk

Eh uh see I'm such a classy guy (yeah i know)
Designer shades hide my eyes
I know lord, with a face like mine
How the hell could I be camera shy
I make it look easy man
But that don't mean it's easy man (no it aint)
Got my middle finger up to the world
With a ring on the thing cause I froze my hand
Yeah in that position, right back clear your position
I'm everythin you're not, you work I'm the boss
I reverent run this man
I could turn your house into mine
And I could turn your girl into mine (one time)
Imma stay in my grind you could be in my life
And never let a nigga take my shine

Ive been talkin' 'bout my new diamond rings
Because my new diamond rings they're the shit
Oh oh oh you've been talkin' 'bout my new diamond rings
Because my new diamond rings,
They're whats in
And if you're looking at me,
You gon' be looking at them
'Cause there the swagger that you see in my walk
And if you're listening to me,
You gon' be listening to them
'Cause there the slick that you hear in my talk
