I needed a little space
Honest, thought that you'd stay waiting
I made my last mistake, hmm-mmm
You're happy and I hate it

And now I know that I spoke too soon
Seeing how fast you made moves
I want you so bad (now I know)
I want you back, but you're gone

All on my own, I miss you
I know it's too late, can't handle that truth
I want you so bad (now I know)
I need you back, but you're gone

It should've been me all along (should a been you)
It should've been me every time I closed my eyes
Yeah, I can see, those times where I used to be
Well, oh God, it should've been me all along
(Should a been you)

Well, this was that it seems
'Cause you don't think of me that often
How could I let you leave me, yeah
Well, it's too late to stop ya

And now I know that I spoke too soon
