And so I've arrived
With gold in my eyes
Are you paying attention?

I was searching for something
As I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone?
As I watched you go
I am mad because I don't know what you used me for
I've been looking for so long
In Amerika
Throw my hands in the air!

Flash faded
Say you care but you don't
You know I hate it!
It's a rich kid game didn't grow up with a throne
It's all it really is

I was searching for something
As I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone?
As I watched you go
I am mad because I don't know what you used me for
Always talkin' 'bout one day
In Amerika
It's the same story
You want glory son
I've been looking for so long
But you cut me out!
Throw my hands in the air cause I...

Your palace
All the friends you own
So jealous
Felt that rich kid pain what it is to be alone
It's all it really is

I was searching for something
As I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone?
As I watched you go
I am mad because I don't know what you used me for
Always talking about one day in Amerika
It's the same story
You want glory son
In Amerika! In Amerika! In Amerika!
