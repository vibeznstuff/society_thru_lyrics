I was living in a world of make believe
When my best friend wrote and told me
That there may be a job in the city
And you never told me

He would dream about another scheme
About another sordid hall of dreams
About a man who's king of industry
He would swear by his mouth almighty
He would buy the best
But never something new
And he never told me

I like kicking in the gutter and
Wishing I was lucky
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky
Oh I like kicking in the gutter
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky

It's the only life I know
Lie, lie, lie is all you ever do
To make me want to push on through
Cry, cry, cry cry is all I ever do
Say that's how you want to make me push on through

I like kicking in the gutter and
Wishing I was lucky
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky
Oh I like kicking in the gutter
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky

My best friend wrote and told me so
He said that there may be a job in the city

I like kicking in the gutter and
Wishing I was lucky
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky
I was wishing I was lucky

Hey son go, hey son go, to the city
