Ten cents a dance
It's the only price to pay
Why give 'em more
When it's only love for sale?
Adam and Eve
It's the oldest game in town
Just a one way street
To a faded magazine

Kiss and tell
Money talks - it never lies
Kiss and tell
Give and take
eye for an eye
Fever - the heat of the night
Dreamer - stealer of sighs

One public face
In a private limousine
Flash photograph
It's the only light you see
No secret life
There's no secret you can steel
Your lips are moving
But I will never know
What they mean

Kiss and tell
Money talks - and love...it burns
Kiss and tell
Give and take - we live and learn
Fever - the heat of the night
Dreamer - stealer of sighs

Fever - the heat of the night
Dreamer - stealer of sighs

Kiss and tell
We never lie
Kiss and tell
Eye for an eye
Kiss and tell
Blood on a nail
Kiss and tell
Kiss me again
Kiss and tell
Kiss and tell
Kiss and tell
Kiss and tell
Kiss and tell
Kiss and tell
Kiss and tell
