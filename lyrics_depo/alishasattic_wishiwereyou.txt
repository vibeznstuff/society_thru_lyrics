I Wish I Were You 

I Wish I Were You 
I wish I could wear your shoes 
Wish I could think from your brain 
I Wish I Were You 
Yes I do 
I Wish I Were You 

In seventies attire 
You know the whole planet 
And the whole planet knows you back 
You flaunt your imperfections 
You carry it off with a wave of confidence 
The hair flicks 
The aura spits 
Out something sparkly 
All this reflects a 
Deliriously happy individual 
Makes me sick to my stomach 

I Wish I Were You 
I wish I could wear your shoes 
Wish I could think from your brain 
I Wish I Were You 
Yes I do 
I Wish I Were You 

Yeah, I'm jealous 
So quote me on that 
I've got a temper 
You're laid back, back 
Do you feel safe with a woman who 
Doesn't even know her politics 
From her poloneck? 

And you go with the flow 
It fits you perfectly 
As you make love on another 
Lip-shaped settee 
You're as cool as can be 

I Wish I Were You 
I wish I could wear your shoes 
I wish I could think from your brain 
I Wish I Were You 
Yes I do 
I Wish I Were You 

Strange soul you are 
I stand in wonder 
You make your own rules 
And use your own devices 
You lay back 
Easy to do 

(ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah) 
(ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah) 

I Wish I Were You 
I wish I could wear your shoes 
I Wish I could think from your brain 
I Wish I Were You 
Yes I do 
I Wish I Were You
