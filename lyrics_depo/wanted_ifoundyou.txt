She wants me to come over
I can tell her eyes don't lie
She's calling me in the dark
She moves us where the room around the lights turn like the sky
Confidence like a rock star


I wanna put my hands on her hands
Feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the starlight
I'm moving to the beat of her heart
I was so lost until tonight, tonight


I found you, in my darkest hour
I found you, in the pouring rain
I found you, when I was on my knees
And your light brought me back again
Found you in the river of pure emotion
I found you, my only truth
I found you with the music playing

I was lost 'til I found you, you, you
'Til I found you, you, you


The night is getting older
And I can't come off this high
I don't want this here to end


I know she feels the same
Cause I can see it in her eyes
She says, "Can we start again?"


I wanna put my hands on her hands
Feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the starlight


She's moving to the beat of my heart
We were so lost until tonight, tonight


I found you, in my darkest hour
I found you, in the pouring rain
I found you, when I was on my knees
And your light brought me back again
Found you in the river of pure emotion
I found you, my only truth
I found you with the music playing

I was lost 'til I found you, you, you
'Til I found you, you, you


I said, people
We're all looking for love tonight
But sometimes we can't see it
We're all blinded by the light
And we all get low, all get low
Searching for that piece of mind
Just when I have given up
Looking for some kind of sign


That's when I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you

I found you, in my darkest hour
I found you, in the pouring rain
I found you, when I was on my knees
And your light brought me back again
Found you in the river of pure emotion
I found you, my only truth
I found you with the music playing

I was lost 'til I found you
