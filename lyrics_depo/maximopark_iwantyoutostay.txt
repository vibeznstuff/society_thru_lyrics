I rewrite my life, beneath moonlight
Please hold me now, till my breath runs out
There are many things, that I am not
But there's one thing that, I can't deny

A double bluff, you fed me lines
The shortest cut, you're searching for
A mesh of tones, surround your eyes
I wish I knew, how it came to this

I always said you could rely on me
Now it seems that I was wrong
I want you to stay
I want you to stay with me

‘Cause nothing works ‘round here
Where cranes collect the sky
I long for the neon signs of night
‘Cause nothing works ‘round here

You know the way I feel
Can you remember what we had

Why do you think, I overtake
I speak to you, and you don't say no
A camera runs, just to collect
I wish I knew, how it came to this

The lies we tell, are found on film
And you start to push, your lips to mine
Outside my room, you closed your eyes
And in the end, it came to this

I always said you could rely on me
Now it seems that I was wrong
I want you to stay
I want you to stay with me

‘Cause nothing works ‘round here
Where cranes collect the sky
I think of your face at night
‘Cause nothing works ‘round here

You know the way I feel
Can you remember what we had
As time gets more compressed
You're always my reminder
A lifetime disappears
Can you remember what we had
As time gets more compressed
You are always my reminder

You are always my reminder

You know the way I feel
You know the way I feel
