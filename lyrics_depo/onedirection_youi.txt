I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time


I know how it goes
I know how it goes for wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other
Tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?


You &amp; I
We don't want to be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between
You &amp; I
Not even the gods above
Could separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between
You &amp; I
Oh, you &amp; I


I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground


I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light
Like us
They never tried like us


You &amp; I
We don't want to be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between
You &amp; I
Not even the gods above
Could separate the two of us


'Cause you &amp; I

We don't want to be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you &amp; I
Not even the gods above
Could separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between
You &amp; I


You &amp; I


Oh, you &amp; I 


We can make it if we try
You &amp; I


Oh, you &amp; I
You &amp; I
