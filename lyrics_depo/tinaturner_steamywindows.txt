I WAS THINKING ABOUT PARKING THE OTHER NIGHT
WE WAS OUT ON THE BACK ROAD
ME AND MY WOMAN WAS JUST GETTIN' RIGHT
OUR SYSTEMS ON OVERLOAD
THE RADIO BLASTING IN THE FRONT SEAT
TURNING OUT THE MUSIC FINE
WE WAS SNUGGLED UP IN THE BACK SEAT
MAKING UP FOR LOST TIME

STEAMY WINDOWS - ZERO VISIBILITY
STEAMY WINDOWS - COMING FROM THE BODY HEAT

YOU CAN WINE AND DINE A WOMAN ALL NIGHT
WITH GOOD INTENTIONS
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT COMPETITION ON A BACK ROAD
BREAKS DOWN THE DEFENCES

STEAMY WINDOWS - AIN'T NOBODY CAN SEE
STEAMY WINDOWS - COMING FROM THE BODY HEAT

THERE'S A SOUND OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR 
AND I KNOW IT'S JUST THE WIND
BUT IT MAKES HER SNUGGLE UP JUST A LITTLE BIT CLOSER
AND IT STARTS THINGS HAPPENING AGAIN

STEAMY WINDOWS - ZERO VISIBILITY
STEAMY WINDOWS -COMING FROM THE BODY HEAT
STEAMY WINDOWS - STEAMY WINDOWS
