I wonder if she could tell I'm hard right now, hmmm
Yeah, come on, dance for me baby, ha ha, yeah
Ut oh, you feel that? Alright
Come on, don't stop now
You done did it, come on, uh, yeah, alright, hold on

 - Baby when we're grinding
I get so excited
Ooh, how I like it
I try but I can't fight it
Oh, you're dancing real close
Cuz it's real, real slow
(You know what you're doing, don't you)
You're making it hard for me

All the songs on you requested
You're dancing like you're naked
Oh, it's almost like we're sexing (oh yeah)
Yeah boo, I like it
No, I can't deny it
But I know you can tell
I'm excited, oh girl

 - Step back you're dancing kinda close
I feel a little poke coming through
On you

Now girl I know you felt it
But boo, you know I can't help it
You know what I wanna do



Baby us dancing so close
Ain't a good idea
Cuz I'mma want you now and here
The way that you shake it on me
Makes me want you so bad sexually
Oh girl



Now girl I know you felt it
But boo, you know I can't help it
You know what I wanna do





I love when you shake it like that, ah, ah, ah
I see that you like it like that, oh, oh, oh
I love when you shake it like that, ah, ah, ah
I see that you like it like that, oh, oh, oh



I like the way you move
You're making me want you 
Oh the way you move
I like those things you do
But you're a little too close
