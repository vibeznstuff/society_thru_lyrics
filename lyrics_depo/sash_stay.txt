I had a dream last night
You were there
You held my hand so tight
I thought I'd just die
Do you remember?
When we use to have
So much fun
I used to cry sometimes
Those days are gone
Did you remember?

(Do you re...?)
I wanna go back to
Back to the days
When I needed
A little more fun
When I believed I
I believed I
Could fly so high
Through the clouds

Tear down these walls
If just for one day
Tear down these walls
I need you to stay
Stay.

Turning back time to
Times we made love
All day,
Under the sun
When I believed I
I believed I
Could fly so high
Through the clouds

Tear down these walls
If just for one day
Tear down these walls
I need you to stay
Stay.
