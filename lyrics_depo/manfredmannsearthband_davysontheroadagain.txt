Davy's on the road again
Wearin' different clothes again
Davy's turning handouts down
To keep his pockets clean
All his goods are sold again
His word's as good as gold again
Sez if you see Jean now ask her please to pity me
Jean and I we moved along
Since the day - down in the hollow
When the mind went driftin' on
And the feet were soon to follow

Davy's on the road again
Wearin' different clothes again
Davy's turning handouts down
To keep his pockets clean
Sayin' his goodbyes again
Wheels are in his eyes again
Sez if you see Jean now ask her please to pity me
Downtown in the big town
Gonna set you back on your heels
With a mouth full of memories
And a lot of stickers for my windshield
Shut the door
Cut the light
Davy want be home tonight
You can wait till the dawn rolls in
You won't see our Davy again

Davy's on the road again
Wearin' different clothes again
Davy's turning handouts down
To keep his pockets clean
Sayin' his goodbyes again
Wheels are in his eyes again
Sez if you see Jean now ask her please to pity me
Downtown in the big town
Gonna set you back on your heels
With a mouth full of memories
And a lot of stickers for my windshield
Shut the door
Cut the light
Davy want be home tonight
You can wait till the dawn rolls in
You won't see our Davy again
