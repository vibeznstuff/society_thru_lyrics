You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You never take advice
Someday you'll pay the price, I know

I've seen it before
It happens all the time
You're closing the door
You leave the world behind

You're digging for gold
Yet throwing away
A fortune in feelings
But someday you'll pay

You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You want Paradise
But someday you'll pay the price
I know

I've seen it before
It happens all the time
You're closing the door
You leave the world behind
You're digging for gold
Yet throwing away
A fortune in feelings
But someday you'll pay

Cold as ice, you know that you are
Cold, (cold) as, (as) ice,
As cold as ice to me
(Cold, cold cold) (as, as, as) (ice)

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, cold as, cold as ice)
(You're as cold as icccce)
You're as cold as ice
(Cold as icccce),
Cold as ice I know
(You're as cold as icccce)
You're as cold as ice
(Cold as iccce)
Cold as ice I know
(You're as cold as icccce)
Oh yes I know
(Cold as icccce)
(You're as cold as icccce)
You're as cold as ice
(Cold as icccce)
Cold as ice I know
(You're as cold as icccce)
Oh, yes I know
(Cold as icccce)
