By the way he looks across his shoulder
And the way he sees me through his eyes
It's impossible to disguise he's a mama's boy
So confusing to my sense of humor
Is the way he hurts so easily
Oh anyone can see he's a mama's boy


First he holds me too softly
Then he touches me barely
Mama's boy
Then he loves me too quickly
Oh he's everything but manly
Mama's boy

It's a funny kind of situation
Can't relate to what is happening
I'm tired of makin' time with a mama's boy
It's an insult of my sense of livin'
Well it seems I'm doin' all the givin'
I can't waste one more night on a mama's boy


First he holds me too softly
Then he touches me barely
Mama's boy
Then he loves me too quickly
Oh he's everything but manly
Mama's boy

Well she tied him to her apron  strings
Now he needs her advice on everything
On anyone can see he's a mama's boy
Don't know why he gets involved with women
He's a closet case with all the trimmings
He's such a pretty thing he's a mama's boy
