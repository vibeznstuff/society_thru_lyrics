The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got
Your love has captured me
Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside
I knew it was real
The way you make me feel
Lying here next to you
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more
Let's give love a try
Sweeter and sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With hearts in love will find
True love
In a special way        
The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me what you've got
Your love has captured me
Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside
I knew this was real (got to be real)
The way you make me feel (you know)
My baby, my baby, my baby, my love
Come a little closer so we can see into the eyes of love
Just a little a closer let me speak to you 
I wanna tell you something
Here I am-- I just want you to come closer
Come a little closer let me whisper in your ear
‘Cause I wanna tell you something
Move a little a little closer we can say for real
The way we feel about each other’s lovin’…
