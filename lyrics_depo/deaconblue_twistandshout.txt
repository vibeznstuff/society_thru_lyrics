You've got a lot of
Tings to say about the
Big world and the
High skies so you
Walk a little in a
Long mile to be
Sure your eyes can see the
Right sights

I see a
Pale girl in a
Blue room with a
Pink dress and a
Wide smile I see a
Pale girl in a
Blue room with a
Pink dress and a
Wide smile

You've got a little
Way to go before you
Find the knowledge that you're
Searching for so you'll
Turn the big world
Upside down
To find the things that you
Never wanted

I see a
Pale girl in a
Blue room with a
Pink dress and a
Wide smile I need a
Pink smile on a
Dark night from the
Right girl to be
Sure it's right

You've got three million things to get mad about
Another hundred things to get glad about
Junk food
The whole world over's good as standing round
So baby twist and shout baby
Find out baby
Find out baby
Find out baby

So it's April and the
Tings you say don't
Seem as certain as on
Hogmanay when we
Kissed at midnight and a
Wee wee bells had
Gave me courage for my
My heart to tell

I see a
Pale girl in a
Blue room with a
Pink dress and a
Wide smile I need a
Pink smile on a
Dark night from the
Right girl to be
Sure it's right



Twist and shout
Come on come on baby
