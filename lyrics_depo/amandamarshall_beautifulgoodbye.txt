I'm fed up with my destiny
And this place of no return
I think I'll take another day
And slowly watch it burn
And it doesn't really matter
How the time goes by
'Cause I still remember you and I
And that beautiful goodbye

We staggered through these empty streets
Laughing arm in arm
The night had made a mess of me
Your confessions kept me warm
I don't really miss you, I just need to know
Do you ever think of you and I
And that beautiful goodbye

When I see you now
I wonder how
I could've watched you walk away
If I let you down
Please forgive me now
For that beautiful goodbye

In these days of no regrets
I keep mine to myself
And all the things we never said
I can save for someone else
And nothing lasts forever
But we always try
And I just can't help but wonder why
We let it pass us by, yeah

When I see you now
I wonder how
I could've watched you walk away
If I let you down
Please forgive me now
For that beautiful goodbye

Baby, what can I do
Oh, to get through to you
And sometimes I cry, yeah
It's a fool's lullaby
Sometimes I cry
It's just a fool's lullaby
I'm dying inside
