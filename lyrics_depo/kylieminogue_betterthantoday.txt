Oh I see what she do
But I can do it better
And the talk of the town is true
But I'll make you forget her

How can you hate something that you ain't have tried
You got to lose control almost every night yeah
See what they do
We can do it better; yeah I'm talking to you

You've got to...
Feel it
See it
Know how much you mean it
What's the point of livin' if you don't take a chance?
You got to...
Lose it
Cruise it
Know the chance to do it
What's the point of livin' if you don't wanna dance?
Ah-ow!

Oh I know life is hard
So I live it for the weekend
You can hurt under
Oh I guess it really deepens

What's the point of worrying about being cool?
When there's a million things to learn they never teach you at school
Oh don't believe what they say
We just want tomorrow to be better than today

You've got to...
Feel it
See it
Know how much you mean it
What's the point of livin' if you don't take a chance?
You've got to...
Use it
Lose it
Know the chance to do it
What's the point of livin' if you don't wanna dance?

Oh you've got to...
Feel it
See it
Know how much you mean it
What's the point of livin' if you don't take a chance
You've got to...
Use it
Lose it
Cruise it
Know the chance to do it
What's the point of livin' if you don't wanna dance?
Ah-ow!

Fabrications complicate the word in the world
Too much useless information plays with your head
Very clever people know we all need a chance
To stop our clever business and let go and dance

You've got to...
Feel it
See it
Know how much you mean it
What's the point of livin' if you don't take a chance?
You got to...
Lose it
Cruise it
Know the chance to do it
What's the point of livin' if you don't wanna dance?
Ah-ow!

Ah-ow, ah-ow everybody, everybody wanna dance now
Ah-ow, ah-ow everybody, everybody wanna dance now
