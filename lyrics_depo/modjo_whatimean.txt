What I mean, what I am 
What I feel about the meaning of my life 
What I need, what I feel 
What I like to say and what I lie about 

What I can't get choose to it 
I get out of my mind 
The world's just up my feelings 
And I just can't even cry 

I should rare my way back home right now 
(Cause I gave her everything I got) 
I can't stand the way she broke my heart 
(Cause I gave her) 

All my dreams, all my hopes 
Are the things I love and that I use to know 
God I pray every day 
But I feel so empty since you went away 

What I can't get choose to it 
I get out of my mind 
The world's just up my feelings 
And I just can't even cry 

I should rare my way back home right now 
(Because I gave her everything I got) 
I can't stand the way she broke my heart 
(Because I gave her) 

Ohh...ahh...ohh...ahh 

What I can't get choose to it 
I get out of my mind 
The world's just up my feelings 
And I just can't even cry 

This moon will last forever 
Or maybe till I die 
So why keep holding on 
Until I get another time 

I should rare my way back home right now 
(I'm gonna gave her everything I got) 
I can't stand the way she broke my heart 
(No I can't stand the way you broke my heart) 

I should rare my way back home right now 
(Cause I gave her everything I got) 
I can't stand the way she broke my heart 
(Ohh, ei-ei-ei) 

I should rare my way back home right now 
I can't stand the way she broke my heart
