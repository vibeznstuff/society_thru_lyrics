Turn the lights out, in the light house,
I saw you coming,
Felt the ship wreck
Saw the wreckage, I heard you yelling,
Just then that's when I saw your reflection in the sand,
Wondering where you were washed up,
Oh, I ran to the water, Mmmmm,
I can put my hands down in it,
But It won't bring nothing up,
Sitting at the shore all day, waiting on the tide to come

But you can't hold on to water
If fills you up but never stays
It's only good to wash away, today
And your loving me like water
Your slippin' through my fingers, such a
Natural disaster love
Bringing on the flood of love,
Love me like a flood of love
Bring it on

Stayed the night out, by the beach house, it's all so quiet
Lit a candle by the window, so you might find it
Hope you know you'll always have a place to call your home
Still, I can't help but think, I could have saved you from drowning,
Ohhh, oh,
I can put my hands down in it, yeah,
But It won't bring nothing up,
Sitting on the shore all day
Just waiting on the tide to come,

But you can't hold on to water,
It fills you up but never stays,
It's only good to wash away,
Today and your loving me like water,
You're slipping through my fingers, such a
Natural disaster love, bringing on the flood of love,
Love me like a flood of love,
Bring it on,

I knew the waves were icy, when I felt them all retreating,
Went to take a dive in the deep end,
Oh, what was I thinking?

But you can't hold on to water,
It fills you up but never stays,
It's only good to wash away,
Today and your loving me like water,
You're slipping through my fingers, such a
Natural disaster love, bringing on the flood of love,
Love me like a flood of love
Bring it on,
Ohohohoh Ohohohoh
Rising and falling of my tears,
Rising and the falling of my tears have filled the ocean, (the ocean, the ocean)
