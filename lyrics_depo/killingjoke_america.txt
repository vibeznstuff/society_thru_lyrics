I can survive the rat race honey 
Time is money and money is honey, honey 
My megabucks your symmetrical beauty 
Together we can serve the nation - yeah! 

The quality of life filled us all with pride 
America 
And as I watched I just cried and cried 
How I love America 

I will buy you rich perfumes 
And we will eat the finest foods 
A mansion in New England 
A silver dollar for every child 
Where everybody has got their price 
They'll sustain our way of life 
You and I will fly to Rio 
I'll make you feel like a millionaire 

I can survive the rat race honey 
Time is money and money is honey, honey 
My megabucks your symmetrical beauty 
Together we can serve the nation - yeah! 

The quality of life filled us all with pride 
America 
And as I watched I just cried and cried 
How I love America 

West is best and might is right 
And with our allies - fight the good fight 
A first class, five star enterprise 
Now everybody's got to compromise 
My moral code's on overload 
Liberty still takes its toll 
Take a look at the losers wasting in the bars 
Where they cut their losses! 

I can survive the rat race honey 
Time is money, and money is honey, honey 
My megabucks your symmetrical beauty 
Together we can serve the nation - yeah! 

The quality of life filled us all with pride 
America 
And as I watched I just cried and cried 
How I love America 

There were fireworks in the Gulf 
There was champagne at home - How I love America 
But showbiz and Hollywood still shouted out - America
