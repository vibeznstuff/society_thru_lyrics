This is our time
They go fearless shine
As the dawn brings
The world wakes
Catch you in my eye

Nothing can touch where we've been tonight
As the sun moves across you
Standing in our Half-Light
In the Half-Light
We go home

What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight

In the Half-Light
We go home
What we felt tonight
In the Half-Light
We go home
What we felt tonight

This is our time
They go fearless shine
As the dawn brings
The world wakes
Catch you in my eye

Nothing can touch where we've been tonight
As the sun moves across you
Standing in our Half-Light
In the Half-Light
We go home

What we felt tonight
In the Half-Light
We go home

What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight
(We go home)
What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight
What we felt tonight

This is our time
They go fearless shine
As the dawn brings
The world wakes
Catch you in my eye

Nothing can touch where we've been tonight
As the sun moves across you
Standing in our Half-Light
In the Half-Light
We go home

What we felt tonight
In the Half-Light
We go home

What we felt tonight
