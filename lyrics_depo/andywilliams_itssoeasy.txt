It's so easy
To be in love with you girl
You make it easy
Doing things that you do

Never before have I found that someone
Who tried to please me... Please me baby

Oh, it's so easy
And every day you find
New ways to tease me
And good things happen on the way

Never before have I found that someone
Who tried to please me... Please me baby

You can see (you can see)
You are good for me (good for me)
We are meant to be (meant to be)
Together you and me (you and me oh it's so easy)

Oh, I've never felt this way before girl
Oh, I keep running back for more girl
Love me... and I'll be yours
You can be sure
'cause it's so easy to love you... Love you baby

It's so easy
To be in love with you girl
You make it easy
Doing things that you do

Never before have I found that someone
Who tried to please me
Please me... Please me baby

It' so easy
