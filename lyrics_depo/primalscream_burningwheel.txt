Through my diseased eyes I'm sinful, sly, I can't stop stealing
I will pay the price of being a thief when I stop breathing

If you could see what I can see, feel what I feel
When my head is on fire, when I'm a burning wheel

Through my bleeding eyes, I'm filthy, fly, I crawl with insects
I'm anaesthetized, I'm demonized caught in the vortex

If you could see what I can see, feel what I feel
When my head is on fire, when I'm a burning wheel

I see, I feel, I see, I feel
I see, I feel, I see, I feel

If you could see what I can see, feel what I feel
When my head is on fire, when I'm a burning wheel
