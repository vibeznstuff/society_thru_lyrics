For all those who stood up and were counted
For all those for whom money was no motive
For all those for whom music was a message
I want to thank you

For making me
A little more sure
A little more wise
And couragious

You told me to look much further
You told me to walk much more
You told me that music matters
And to chase the dogs back from my door

I won't stop here
I won't be still untill the sun sets
On us all..


Under the sheets with my radio
Turn down low
So nobody know
It's the late night show
Hopin' to hear Hey Joe
Jimmy was my hero
Head blown by Type R or was it the true star?
From Dali Lama to Tanamo
Curtis Mayfield
Say Kurtis Blow
Singing into my pillow
And praying I don't dose
Untill my 9 Volt battery goes..


You told me to look much further
You told me to walk much more
You told me that music matters
And to chase the dogs back from my door

I won't stop here
I won't be still untill the sun sets
On us all..

You told me to look much further
You told me to walk much more
You told me that music matters
And to chase the dogs back from my door

I won't stop here
I won't be still untill the sun sets
On us all..

You told me that music matters..
You told me that music matters..
You told me that music matters..
You told me that music matters..
