I don't know about you
But if you're feeling the groove
You know what you gotta do
It's got to be funky


(Let's dance) get on the floor no need to hold back
Sexy thong, mini-skirt, stilettos on, shakin' all that (let's dance)
What you doin' to me girl I can't hold back
Some hot stuff is all that I need
So why we waitin' (let's dance)


Hit the floor show me what you workin'
Sequins on your skirt accentuates all of your curves and
Girl you know I'm likin' all the things you're doin'
Specially when them other girls be checkin' out your moves and

Girl I want in
The way you turnin' me on I can't even begin
You so hot like you come straight out of the kitchen
When you dip it down low 'cos we trippin'
'Cos now other guys be lookin' at you
'Cos your so damn fine, really blows my mind
Girl it's all about you so what we gonna do


(Let's dance) get on the floor no need to hold back
Sexy thong, mini-skirt, stilettos on, shakin' all that (let's dance)
What you doin' to me girl I can't hold back
Some hot stuff is all that I need
So why we waitin' (let's dance)


On the floor as I pull you close in
Hands all up my back with my arms wrapped around your waist and
Temperature be risin' beat straight hypnotizin'
Ain't no time for talkin' girl let's keep this whole thing movin'

Know what I'm sayin'
Hop in then we be just straight up misbehavin'
Girl you makin' me hard what a feelin'
Especially when you spin around rub up on my (beep)
And I ain't even playin' (that's right)
So many things I wanna do (tonight)
You make we wanna go home with you (that's right)
So maybe they all like to think it through
But right now it's all about me and you so


(Let's dance) get on the floor no need to hold back
Sexy thong, mini-skirt, stilettos on, shakin' all that (and all that) (let's dance)
What you doin' to me girl I can't hold back
Some hot stuff is all that I need
So why we waitin' (oh)

The way that you move it's got me feenin for more
The glare of the strobe lights getting down on the floor
Syncopated reactions girl well that's how I do
But it ain't about me no it's all about you

Don't want this to stop so let the record just play
Till the crowd wants the re-wind get it from the DJ
Girl I wish that we didn't have no clothes on at all
But before we head to the door


(Let's dance) get on the floor no need to hold back
Sexy thong, mini-skirt, stilettos on, shakin' all that (and all that) (let's dance)
What you doin' to me girl I can't hold back
Some hot stuff is all that I need
So why we waitin' (oh)
