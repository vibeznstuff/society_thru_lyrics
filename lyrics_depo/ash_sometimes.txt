Can't sleep in the city, you're far away
Cigarettes keep me skinny
And my mind off the rain
Oh sometimes, sometimes
Oh sometimes, sometimes

Feelings are distant, and I know guilt by name
It was the hardest thing, watching you slip away
Oh sometimes, sometimes
Oh sometimes, sometimes

Sometimes it happens, feelings die,
Whole years are lost in the blink of an eye
We once had it all but events conspired
Oh sometimes

Good morning sweet thing, you're safe in my hands
I am no saint, but I understand
Oh sometimes, sometimes
Oh sometimes, sometimes

Sometimes it happens, feelings die,
Whole years are lost in the blink of an eye
We once had it all but events conspired
Oh sometimes
Now that it is over, it is through
It gets me every time I think of you
And sometimes it happens, feelings die
Oh sometimes

I miss your warm skin beside me at night
And I miss your flesh in the dawn light
Oh sometimes, sometimes
Oh sometimes, sometimes

Sometimes it happens, feelings die,
Whole years are lost in the blink of an eye
We once had it all but events conspired
Oh sometimes

Saturn's decline in my star sign
Seasonal adjustments, stars realign
Sometimes it happens, feelings die
Oh sometimes, sometimes
