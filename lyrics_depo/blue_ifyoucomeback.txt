C'mon c'mon
Yeah
Can you feel me?
(Baby can you feel me?)
I've got something to say
Check it out
For all this time
I've been lovin' you girl
Oh yes I have
And ever since the day
You left me here alone
I've been trying to find
Oh, the reason why

So if I did
Something wrong
Please tell me
I wanna understand
'Cause I don't want
This love to ever end

And I swear
If you come back
In my life
I'll be there till the end of time
(Come back to me
Come back to me
Back into my life)
And I swear
I'll keep you right
By my side
'Cause baby
You're the one I want
(Come back to me
Come back to me
Back into my life)
Oh yes you are

I watched you go
You've taken
My heart with you
Oh yes you did
Every time
I tried to reach you
On the phone
Baby you're never there
Girl you're never home

So if I did something wrong
Please tell me
I wanna understand
'Cause I don't want
This love to ever end
No, no, no, no

I swear
If you come back
In my life
I'll be there till the end of time
(Come back to me
Come back to me
Back into my life)
And I swear
I'll keep you right
By my side
'Cause baby
You're the one I want
(Come back to me
Come back to me
Back into my life)
Oh yes you are

Maybe I didn't know
How to show it
And maybe
I didn't know
What to say
This time
I won't disguise
Then we can
Build our lives
Then we can
Be as one

I swear
If you come back
In my life
I'll be there till the end of time
(Come back to me
Come back to me
Back into my life)
Oh yeah
And I swear
I'll keep you right
By my side
'Cause baby
You're the one I want
(Come back to me
Come back to me)
Oh yes you are

And I swear
If you come back
In my life
I'll be there till the end of time
(Come back to me
Come back to me
Back into my life)
Oh yeah
And I swear
I'll keep you right
By my side
