I said I'm about five minutes away
One more stop and I'll be off this train
I'm free any day of the week, always losing some sleep

I told myself I'll be back by ten
Trying to save myself for the weekend
But I know me, I hate to miss a party

Don't say, don't say I didn't warn you
Don't say I didn't warn you
I live for the moment

I wasn't supposed to go out tonight
I should be at home, I got work at 9
Shouldn't be out here doing what I like
But it feels so good, so good

I was only gonna be an hour or two
I guess that now I'm here I'm going down with you
But it feels so good, so good

Angel on my shoulder's giving up on me
No listening to him and I can hardly speak
The music they play, makes me this way, oh yeah

It was only 10, how did it get to 3?
It's like I'm in my own time machine
But you know me, I'll never leave

Don't say, don't say I didn't warn you
Don't say I didn't warn you
Just live for the moment

I wasn't supposed to go out tonight
I should be at home, I got work at 9
Shouldn't be out here doing what I like
But it feels so good, so good

I was only gonna be an hour or two
I guess that now I'm here I'm going down with you
But it feels so good, so good

Cause everyone I know is here
Drinking sours, crying tears
Living out the best years
So keep on toasting shots, cheers
People know it feels
So good

I wasn't supposed to go out tonight
I should be at home, I got work at 9
Shouldn't be out here doing what I like
But it feels so good, so good

I was only gonna be an hour or two
I guess that now I'm here I'm going down with you
But it feels so good, so good
