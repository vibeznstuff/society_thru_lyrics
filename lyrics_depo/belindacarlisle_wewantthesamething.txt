Here is my case
We've got no time to waste
Cuz we want the same thing

We're fighting a war
But we don't know what for
Cuz we want the same thing

I know we're different now
Different as night and day
But still want you near
I just want you to stay
I wanna take this chance
I want to be with you
Cuz what you're looking for
I am looking for too

We dream the same thing
We want the same thing ...ooh...
And all that we need is to
See it together
We dream the same dream
We want the same thing ...ooh...
For now, for love, forever, amen

I look in your eyes and
I know deep inside that
We want the same thing

Breaking the chains that
Just keep us in shame
Cuz we want the same thing

No matter what we say
No matter what we do
Beyond the battlelines
Baby we know what's true

We dream the same thing
We want the same thing ...ooh...
And all that we need is to
See it together
We dream the same dream
We want the same thing ...ooh...
For now, for love, forever, amen
