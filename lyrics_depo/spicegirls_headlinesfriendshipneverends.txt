The time is now or never to fit the missing piece
To take this song together,
You make me feel complete
We fall into the future,
And through the looking glass
The light shines over our heads and so it comes to pass


To go beyond the surface,
To reach into your soul,
This love is not demanding,
My heart has told me so
I hold on to my hero with faith enough to find,
The power to imagine will keep this love alive


Lets make the headlines loud and true,
I wanna tell the world I'm givin it all to you
Lets make the headlines loud and clear
The best things suddenly happen when you are here
If i lost my way you'd carry me home
Take me all the way to heaven never leave me alone,
And its just like everything matters when you are near
(matters when you are near)


And it feels so good every bells gonna ring
Thsi love is alive and its making me sing
I could fly, wanna cry, want the whole world to know,
We are together, come on baby lets go


And words yet to be spoken 
Will fall upon the page
Spelling out true devotion
Is all we need to say


Let's make the headlines, loud and true
(Say you love me and I'll say I love you too)
I wanna tell the world I'm giving it all to you
(Just remember what simple words can do)
Let's make the headlines, loud and clear
(All that I have I give to you my friend)
The best things suddenly happen when you are here
(Just remember friendship never ends)
And if I lost my way you'd carry me home
Take me all the way to heaven, never leave me alone (everything)
And it's just like everything matters when you are near (matters when you're near)
(Say you love me and I'll say I love you too)

Let's make the headline true this time
(Just remember what simple words can do)
There's no hiding from this magical state of mind
(I feel loved with you, I feel loved with you)
And if I lost my way you'd carry me home (I know, you take me, all the way to heaven)
Take me all the way to heaven, never leave me alone (everything)
And it's just like everything matters when you are near (matters when you're near)
(Everything matters, it really matters)


'Cause I'm giving it all
Yeah I'm giving it all to you
