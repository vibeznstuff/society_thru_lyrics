alright, hold on, too close...


Baby when we're grinding
I get so excited
Ooh, how I like it
I try but I can't fight it
Oh, your dancing real close
Plus real real slow
You're making it hard for me


All the slow songs you requested
You're dancing like you're naked
Oh, it's almost like we're sexing (oh yeah)
Yeah boo, I like it
No, I can't deny it
But I know you can tell
I'm excited, oh girl


Step back you're dancing kinda close
I feel a little pull coming through
On you
 Now girl I know you felt it
Before you know I can't help it
You know what I wanna do




Baby girl's dancing so close
Ain't a good idea
Cuz I'mma want you now and here
The way that you shake it on me
Makes me want you so bad sexually
Oh girl



 


 I love when you shake it like that, ah, ah, ah 
 I see that you like it like that, ha, ha, hahh 
 I love when you shake it like that, ah, ah, ah 
 I see that you like it like that, ha, ha, hahh
