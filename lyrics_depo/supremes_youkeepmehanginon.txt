Set me free, why don't you, baby?
Get out my life, why don't you, baby?
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hangin' on

Why do you keep a-coming around
Playing with my heart?
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me make a new start?
Let me get over you
The way you've gotten over me, hey

Set me free, why don't you, baby?
Let me be, why don't you, baby? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now you don't really want me
You just keep me hangin' on

You say although we broke up
You still wanna be just friends
But how can we still be friends
When seeing you only breaks my heart again?
And there ain't nothing I can do about it

Whoa-whoa-whoa
Set me free, why don't you, baby?
Whoa-whoa-whoa
Get out my life, why don't you, baby? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Set me free, why don't you, baby?
Get out my life, why don't you, baby?

You claim you still care for me
But your heart and soul needs to be free
Now that you've got your freedom
You wanna still hold on to me
You don't want me for yourself
So let me find somebody else, hey

Why don't you be a man about it
And set me free? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now, you don't care a thing about me
You're just using me (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Go on, get out, get out of my life
And let me sleep at night (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
