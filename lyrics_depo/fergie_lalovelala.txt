Mustard on the beat

Uh, tell 'em where I'm from
Finger on the pump make the sixth straight jump from SoCal
Hollywood to the slums
Chronic smoke get burnt by the California sun
On the west side east coast where you at
Just got to New York like a net on a jet
To London, to Brazil, to Quebec
Like the whole damn world took effect to Ferg
Tell 'em

Laid back, slow down
Better represent when we come to your town
So lay back, slow down
What you represent when we come to your town
Say

Get in with the business
I'ma be there in a minute
I just booked a Paris ticket
Thinking Russia need a visit
I'ma run it to the limit
And be on my way to Venice

Uh tell em where I'm at
From the plaques to the uh uh
Everything phat
Got Mustard on a track
My girls all stack
When I roll down the window, let me know where you're
Atlanta, North South Cac-ill-ac
Texas grill, Cadillacs through Miami then back
To London, Jamaica then France
The whole damn world took effect to Ferg, tell 'em

Laid back, slow down
Better represent when we come to your town
Laid back, slow down
What you represent when we come to your town
Say

Get em with the business
When I come from Kansas City
Hit manila 'til it's Christmas
Out to India I’ll visit

Then my people back to Venice
