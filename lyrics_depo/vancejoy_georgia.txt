She is something to behold
Elegant and bold
She is electricity
Running to my soul

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed
Singing Georgia on my mind

And I...
And I...

Lips generous and warm
You build me up like steps
Eyes innocent and wild
Remind me what it's like

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again
I'm burning up

And I, I never understood what was at stake
I never thought your love was worth its weight
Well now you've come and gone
I finally worked it out
I worked it out

I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be


And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again, I'm burning up

And I, I never understood what was at stake
I never thought your love was worth its weight
Well now you've come and gone
I finally worked it out
I worked it out
