Hit the message I can hear you calling 
No one's going anywhere tonight 
We conceived a modern generation 
It was free but now we pay the price 

We're the victims of our own creation 
Chasing rainbows that are painted black or white 
Watch the struggle of our own temptation 
Instincts barely keeping us alive 

Back to the rhythm that we all came from 
Voices of Babylon, streets of London 
Back to the people that we know so well 
A space in time removed too soon to tell 

Just a product of imagination 
Patiently we wait for our turn to come 
A small collection of the population 
By the time our number's up, we could be gone

Back to the rhythm that we all came from 
Voices of Babylon, streets of London 
Back to the people that we know so well 
A space in time removed too soon to tell

Back to the rhythm that we all came from 
Voices of Babylon streets of London town
