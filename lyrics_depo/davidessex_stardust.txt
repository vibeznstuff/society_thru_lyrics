Ah look what they've done to da rock'n'roll clown
Ah rock'n'roll clown look he's down on the ground
Well he used to high fly, but he crashed out the sky
In a stardust fling hey rock 'n roll king is down

Roll on up won't you come and take at look at me, ah
Come on stand in line just one at a time t' see me
See my painted-on grin, as I stand up to sing
In a stardust fling, hey rock'n'roll king is down

But he's the leader of the band
Yes a lonely man
Doncha you wanna take his hand
Yes you know you can..an, owwww

Well I used to high fly, but I crashed out the sky
In a stardust fling hey rock'n'roll king is down
In a stardust fling hey rock'n'roll king is down
In a stardust fling hey rock'n'roll king is, down
In a stardust fling hey rock'n'roll king is, down
In a stardust fling hey rock'n'roll king is da down
In a stardust fling hey rock'n'roll king is, down
In a stardust fling hey rock'n'roll king is, down
In a stardust fling hey
