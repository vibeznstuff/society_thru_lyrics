You don't have to say you're sorry 
To look on further down the line 
Into the sun 
Too close at heaven 
Love is fine 
But you can't hold it like a... 

Two worlds apart and two together 
Into that good night kiss away 
One takes the hard 
One the other 
Kiss a way 

Are you living for love? 
Are you living for love? 
When the road gets too tough 
Is your love strong enough? 

(are you living?) 
(are you living for love?) 

Do you feel your head is full of thunder? 
Questions never end? 
Empty nights alone? no wonder 
It all comes back again 

Are you living for love? 
Are you living for love? 
I've been under the gun 
I've lost and I've... 

(one, two, three, four...) 
Forget the many steps to heaven 
It never happened and it ain't so hard 
Happiness is a loaded weapon and a 
Short cut is better by far 
Explosive bolts, ten thousand volts 
At a million miles an hour 
Abrasive wheels and molten metals 
It's a semi-automatic, get in the car 
Corrosive heart and frozen heat 
We're worlds apart where we could meet 
Where the street fold round and the motors start 
And the idiot wields the power 
Where the chosen hold the highest card 
On the field of honour where the ground is hard 
So the highest hand is joking wild 
And the house soon fold and no-one stand 
I put my finger on and dialled 
The tower, the moon, the gun, and 
Nine nine nine, singer down 
Cloudburst and all around 
The first are last, the blessed get wired 
The best is yet to come 
I put my finger on and fired 
Heat-seeking, out of the sun 
You can set the controls for the heart or the knees 
And the meek'll inherit what they damn well please 
Get ahead, go figure, go ahead and pull the trigger 
Everything under the gun
