Land of the free, home of the brave
But Lord knows that we need plenty change
舛ause plenty chains in the past leaving deep scars
But when the sun come down we gonna be stars

The doors are locked where they once stood open
A wound of fear where we once stood hoping
The shattered glass where the bullets broke in
I'm looking for the place that I was born
I'm looking for a way to fix what's torn
I'm looking for America

I'm looking for America

Yeah, you know
Beaten red white and blue for the green we pursue
I知 still looking for you


America who are you?
Underneath the red blue and white?
America who are you?
I wonder who you are tonight
America who are you?
Is God still on your side?
I want to see a nation rise above the fear and fight that haunts these streets tonight

I'm looking for America
I知 looking for a place to breathe in
A place I could call my home
I知 looking for America
I'm looking for the land of freedom
A place I can call my own

I知 looking for America
Headlines that I can't believe in
But I'm still holding on to hope
I'm looking for a miracle
I'm looking for a miracle
I'm looking for America

America who are you?
Am I asking for too much
America who are you?
Has your dream become out of touch
America who are you?
Do you get what you deserve
Between the violence and entitlements
Which nation do you serve?

I'm looking for America
I知 looking for a place to breathe in
A place I could call my home
I知 looking for America
I'm looking for the land of freedom
A place I can call my own

I知 looking for America
Headlines that I can't believe in
But I'm still holding on to hope
I'm looking for a miracle
I'm looking for a miracle
I'm looking for America

I知 singing
Farewell my utopia
Farewell my euphoria
Fare thee well my suburban day-dream
Farewell my utopia


America you so pretty
But you not perfect
Confession of guilt is worth it
These people hurting deserve it
Blood on your hands I saw
When there痴 blood on this nations floor
But it痴 blood on the upper post of your door
If you need to know

I知 looking for your honesty in skeletons
Do away with your ignorance and arrogance
America the land of immigrants
Check the green card and pedigree
Bless the Choctaw and the Cherokee
That we値l never see


I'm looking for America
I知 looking for a place to breathe in
A place I could call my home
I知 looking for America
I'm looking for the land of freedom
A place I can call my own

I知 looking for America
Headlines that I can't believe in
But I'm still holding on to hope
I'm looking for a miracle
I'm looking for a miracle
I'm looking for America


The land of the free, home of the brave
But Lord knows we need plenty change
I知 looking for America
Plenty chains in the past left deep scars
But when the sun come down we gonna be stars
And may the stripes heal when it痴 through
Beaten red white blue for the green that we pursue

I知 looking for America
