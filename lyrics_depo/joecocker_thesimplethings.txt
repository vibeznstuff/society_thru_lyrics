Somewhere Along The Way
I Got Caught Up In The Race
I Kept Spinning And Turning
Lost Myself My Hope My Faith

We'Re Always Wanting More Than What We Have
And What I'Ve Learned Is All I Really Need Are...

The Simple Things
That Come Without A Price
The Simple Things
Like Happiness Joy And Love In My Life
I'Ve Seen It All From So Many Sides
And I Hope You Would Agree
The Best Things In Life
Are The Simple Things

Hey Everybody Don'T Get Me Wrong You Got To Understand

As Long As You Take Time To Find...

The Simple Things
That Come Without A Price
The Simple Things
Like Happiness Joy And Love In My Life
I'Ve Seen It All From So Many Sides
And I Hope You Would Agree
That The Best Things In Life
Are The Simple Things



This World Moves So Fast
Sometimes You Got To Slow Down, Down, Down
To Find Out What Its All About

We'Re Always Wanting More Than What We Have
What I'Ve Learned, Is What I Really Need A

The Simple Things
That Come Without A Price
The Simple Things
Like Happiness Joy And Love In My Life
I'Ve Seen It All From So Many Sides
