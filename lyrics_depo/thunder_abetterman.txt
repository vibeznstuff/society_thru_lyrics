Once in a while, I drift in time
To a place in my memory, that it still hurts to find
I was taking on the world with a see-through smile
But dying on the inside all the while
I was, dying on the inside all the while

Like a martyr that don't want sympathy
I locked away my feelings, and threw away the key
It was gonna take a miracle to pierce my pride
And you were the tower of strength to try
When your loving washed right over me like the tide

And now I believe in love (I believe in love)
I believe in love (I believe in love)
You're the reason why I can
Cos when I look, at myself, in the mirror
I see a better man
A better man
Yes its hard finding words that can say how I feel about you
I don't care if it sounds like another old cliche
But I can't stand the thought of living my life without you
For even a day

Oh baby

And now I believe in love (I believe in love)
Yes I believe in love (I believe in love)
You're the reason why I can
Cos when I look, at myself, in the mirror
Oh baby 
When I look at myself in the mirror
When I'm looking at myself in the mirror
I see a better man
