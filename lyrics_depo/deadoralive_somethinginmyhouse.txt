I, I, I-I-I-I-I
I, I, I-I-I-I-I
I am being haunted

It's four o'clock in the morning, 
And I'm sitting on my stairs, 
And there's bangin' round the bedroom,
But no one knows there's no one there,
And I am here all by myself, 
And you're somewhere else with someone else,
And I am being haunted by a love that isn't there

There is something in my house - my house, 
It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair,
There is something in my house - my house, 
I just keep a hearing you runnin' on up my stairs,
But you're not there

I really gotta say it to ya, 
Ya showed me a good time, 
But for every minute that you spent laughin', 
There were hours that I cried,
And I think about what might have been, 
If I'd never met that wicked queen, 
And my heart broke into pieces at midnight on Halloween

There is something in my house - my house, 
It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair,
There is something in my house - my house, 
I just keep a hearing you runnin' on up my stairs,
But you're not there

It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair,

There is something in my house - my house,

But you're not there

I, I, I-I-I-I-I
I, I, I-I-I-I-I
I am being haunted

And I am here all by myself, 
And you're somewhere else with someone else,
And I am being haunted by a love that isn't there

There is something in my house - my house, 
It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair,
There is something in my house - my house, 
I just keep a hearing you runnin' on up my stairs,
But you're not there

It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair,

There is something in my house - my house, 
It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair,
There is something in my house - my house, 
I just keep a hearing you runnin' on up my stairs,
But you're not there

It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair,
