I'm the best friend he's got
I'd give him the shirt off my back
He knows he can trust me with his life
But each time he leaves me alone
Leaves me alone with his wife

I wish he didn't trust me so much
I think he really trusts me too much

How can he be so blind?
We've both got the same good taste
But he should know when he's gone 
Gone on his business trips
I can't help watchin' his woman
But I'm losin' my grip

I wish he didn't trust me so much
I think he really trusts me too much

Though I swear, all is not my will
But there's somethin' about the way
The way she make me feel
Lord, I'm scared, so scared of what I do
If she starts to feelin' the same way too

You shouldn't trust me so much
(We got a problem)
I think you really trust me too much

It's not that she leads me on
I'm gettin' there all by myself
But just being with her 
Being with her all alone
I can't help but hopin'
That he never comes home

I wish he didn't trust me so much
I think you really trust me too much

I wish he didn't trust me so much
(We got a problem baby)
I think you really trust me too much

Though I swear, all is not my will
(Is not my will)
But it's somethin' about the way
The way she makes me feel
Lord, I'm so scared, scared of what I do
If she starts feelin' in that same way too

I wish he didn't trust me so much
(Ooh)
I think he really trusts me too much
(Listen to me)

We got a problem baby
You can see, I'm caught up
(I wish he didn't trust me so much)
Caught up in the middle
(I think he really trusts me too much)
And I'm down, tired of playing second fiddle
