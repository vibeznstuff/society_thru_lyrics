And all I gotta do is sit around and wait
And all I gotta do is not anticipate
And every word I said I should have taken back
And all I gotta do is get my brain on track
And I know what you're thinking, yeah
That you know what's coming now

And everywhere I look
Everything is looking so good
And everyone is you
And I know I tend to rush straight in
I just don't know where to begin
And everyone is you
Everyone is —

And all I gotta do is hold back and wait
But every time I try I make the same mistake
I know all I gotta do is make myself relax
I know all I gotta do is get my brain on track
And I know what you're thinking, yeah
That you know what's coming now

And everywhere I look
Everything is looking so good
And everyone is you
And I know I tend to rush straight in
I just don't know where to begin
And everyone is you
Everyone is —

And I hope that you find it
If freedom is all that you want
I can see a silver lining
I'll be here time after time
Time after time after all

Everywhere I look
Everything is looking so good
And everyone is you
(And everyone is you)
And I know I tend to rush straight in
I just don't know where to begin
And everyone is you
(Don't know where to begin)

And everywhere I look
Everything is looking so good
(And everyone is you)
(Everything is looking so good)
And I know I tend to rush straight in
I just don't know where to begin
And everyone is you
Everyone is —
