Race, life’s a race
And I am gonna win
Yes, I am gonna win

And I’ll light the fuse
And I’ll never lose
And I choose to survive
Whatever it takes

You won’t pull ahead
I’ll keep up the pace
And I’ll reveal my strength
To the whole human race

Yes I am prepared
To stay alive
And I won’t forgive,
Vengeance is mine
And I won’t give in
Because I choose to thrive

Yeah, I’m gonna win!



Race, it’s a race
And I’m gonna win
Yes, I’m gonna win

And I will light the fuse
I’ll never lose
And I choose to survive
Whatever it takes

You won’t pull ahead
'Cause I’ll keep up the pace
And I’ll reveal my strength
To the whole human race

Yes I'm gonna win



Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Win! Win! Win! Win!

Yes I’m gonna win!
