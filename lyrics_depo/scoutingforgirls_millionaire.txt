The best things in life don't come with a price
Forget what they say cause I know they ain't right
All that I need is you
It is you it is you it is you

A walk in the park, a kiss in the dark
The way she looks back every time that we part
All that I need is you
It is you it is you it is you

We could be broke, but I couldn't care
Cause I've got it all
When you're standing there
You make me feel
Like I'm a millionaire

The moment I set my eyes on you girl
I'm like the richest guy in the world
You make me feel
Like I'm a millionaire

Maybe I'm biased, but you're just the finest
Girl that I've met I think you're priceless
All that I need is you
It is you it is you it is you

I'm not going to lie the money'd be nice
Cause I could take you out every night
I'd spend it all on you
It is you it is you it is you

We could be broke, but I couldn't care
Cause I've got it all
When you're standing there
Cause you make me feel
Like I'm a millionaire

The moment I set my eyes on you girl
I'm like the richest guy in the world
You make me feel
Like I'm a millionaire

If money gets tight I'll be alright
As long as you're there, there by my side
Cause you make me feel
Like a millionaire

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

We could be broke, but I couldn't care
Cause I've got it all
When you're standing there
Cause you make me feel
Like I'm a millionaire

The moment I set my eyes on you girl
I'm like the richest guy in the world
You make me feel
Like a millionaire
