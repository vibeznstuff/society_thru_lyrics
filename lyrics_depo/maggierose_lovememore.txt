Shot of Patron
My hair is a mess
I'm out on my own
And I'm working this dress
Breaking the rules that almost broke me
Talking to boys
Ignoring your call
Cause hearing your voice
Would only make me feel small
I couldn't be who you told me to be

With every shared cigarette
The later it gets

I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get living again
I got a few scrapes but I'm back in my skin
Every mistake, I'm owning it
I'm making sure I'm who I'm doing this for
I tried things your way, hey
It wasn't working out for me, hey
Sorry but I gotta say
I love you, but I love me more

Not gonna lie
There's things that I miss
But you never tried
To know me like this
I was losing myself until you lost me

I'm not gonna hide
My lights way too bright

I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get living again
I got a few scrapes but I'm back in my skin
Every mistake, I'm owning it
I'm making sure I'm who I'm doing this for
I tried things your way, hey
It wasn't working out for me, hey
Sorry but I gotta say
I love you, but I love me more
I love me more, yeah

Breaking the rules
Breaking the rules
Breaking the rules
That almost broke me

Breaking the rules
Breaking the rules
Breaking the rules
That almost broke me

Breaking the rules
Breaking the rules
Breaking the rules
That almost broke me

Breaking the rules
Breaking the rules
Breaking the rules

I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get living again
I got a few scrapes but I'm back in my skin
Every mistake, I'm owning it
I'm making sure I'm who I'm doing this for
I tried things your way, hey
It wasn't working out for me, hey
Sorry but I gotta say
I love you, but I love me more
I love me more, yeah
I love you, but I love me more
I love me more
