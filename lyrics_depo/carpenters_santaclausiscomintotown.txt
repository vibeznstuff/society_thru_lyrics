You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's making a list
And checking it twice
Gonna find out
Who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
