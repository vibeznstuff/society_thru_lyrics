Whispering in his ear
My magic potion for love
Telling him I’m sincere
And that there’s nothin’ too good for us

And I just got to be me, be me

Whispering in his ear
My magic potion for love
Telling him I’m sincere
And that there’s nothin’ too good for us

But I want to be free, free, free
And I just got to be me, yeah, be me

Teasing hands, all his might
Give our nights such mystery
Happiness all the time
Oh, and how that man pleases me

But I want to be free, free, free
And I just got to be me, yeah, be me

Ba, de, ah, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
(I just got to be me, be me)
Ba, de, ah, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba

Feeling you close to me
Makes all my senses smile
Let’s not waste ecstasy
‘Cause I’ll only be here for awhile

I’ve got to be free, free, free, oh
And I just got to be me, yeah, yeah, be me, oh
Be free, free, now baby

(I just got to be me) And I just wanna (Be) I just wanna (Me) be me
Free
Free

(I just got to be me) And I just wanna be me (Be me) be me
Whoa, ohoh, free
(I just got to be me, be me)
Me, yeah, yeah

(I just got to be me, be me)
