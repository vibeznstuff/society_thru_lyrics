Always lived my life alone, 
Been searching for a place called home. 
I know that I've been cold as ice, 
Ignored the dreams, too many lies. 
Somewhere deep inside, Somewhere deep inside me, 
I found ... the child I used to be
And I know that it's not too late 
Never,
Too late... 

3 AM!
The painted cow ! 
Yeaaaaaaaaaaah!!

Join the caravan ... (Hey!)

Skippy, the rain won't come!
