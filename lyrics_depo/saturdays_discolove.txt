What you say, Mr Lovable, hey, Mr Love—Lovable
What you say, Mr Got-It-All, hey, Mr Got-It—Mr Got-It-All

We got the disco love, so fun and colorful
It's never winter when it's Donna Summer all year long
You take me back in time to 1979
We'll be at the Bee Gees, baby, everybody "Staying Alive"

Oh, is it love that's in the air?
Baby, baby, baby
Oh, feel the chemistry in here,
Baby, baby, baby

Boy, you make me feel so fine
Boy, you make me feel so good
Boy, you make me feel so right
Baby, baby, baby
Oh, is it love that's in the air?
Baby, baby, baby

What you say, Mr Doable, hey, Mr Do—Doable?
Got me wanting the physical, hey, the physi—physical

We got the disco love, so fun and colorful
It's never winter when it's Donna Summer all year long
You take me back in time to 1999
We hear the DJ playing "Hit Me Baby One More Time"

Oh, is it love that's in the air?
Baby, baby, baby
Oh, feel the chemistry in here,
Baby, baby, baby

Boy, you make me feel so fine
Boy, you make me feel so good
Boy, you make me feel so right

Shake me, baby, baby, baby

Oh, is it love that's in the air?
Baby, baby, baby
Oh, feel the chemistry in here,
Baby, baby, baby
