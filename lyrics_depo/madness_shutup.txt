I tell you I didn't do it
'Cause I wasn't there
Don't blame me, it just isn't fair
You listen to their side
Now listen to mine
Can't think of a story
Sure you'll find me sometime

Now pass the blame and don't blame me
Just close your eyes and count to three
(One two three)
Then I'll be gone and you'll forget
The broken window, t.v. set

It wasn't me either, I'm just his mate
He told me to stand here and watch the gate
I've got a wife and three kids you know
They'll tell you I'm straight, at least I think so
I'm as honest as the day is long,
The longer the daylight, the less I do wrong

Now pass the blame and don't blame me
Just close your eyes and count to three
(One two three)
Then I'll be gone and you'll forget
The broken window, t.v. set

Pass the blame and don't blame me
Just close your eyes and count to three
(One two three)
Then I'll be gone and I'll forget
That what you give is what you get...

Pass the blame and don't blame me
Just close your eyes and count to three
(One two three)
