So now we've got our independence
What are we gonna do with it?
Learning to play different games
Already using different names
Cause now our love bears no resemblance
To what we had before
When our love was good it was all that we saw
When our love was good it blinded us before
This real revolution baby
Where you're not below me anymore

Never never love can never be enough
Never be enough, just ain't good enough
Never never love can never be enough
Never be enough, oh no

So now we've got our independence
What are we gonna do with it?
Building the houses, claiming back the land
Burning the bridges, cleaning up your hands
Cause now our love bears no resemblance
To what we had before

Now our love has something for the future
Now our love will grow the seeds to sow this real revolution
This good revolution baby
Where you're not below me anymore
