Here comes the prophets while devils making the profit
It’s like the pill when you pop it you may never get off it
Now you look to the skies and you searchin' for something
Are you one of the blind?
Are you standing for nothing?
Guess the message is 
You can be apprehensive
And they changing the lesson
Cause the damage it stiffens
The brutality, casualty, mortality rape elevates
Raise your fist and with one voice the people say


The party’s over, it’s over, the party’s over
The party’s over, it’s over, the party’s over
The party’s over, it’s over, the party’s over
The party’s over, it’s fuckin’ over
It’s over now
Yeah it’s over now
It’s over now
Yeah it’s over now


Bullets, missiles and bombs
See you gonna raise hell
So I yell to the devil get back in his hell
In your party commercials, illuminati rehearsals
And your lies uncivilized, systematic reversal
As you can see in the tease, tricked by government green
Border wars on the poor, new world order machine
The future of youth goes to your funky militia, enlisted
Yeah your fuckin’ party’s over, ya missed it!


The party’s over, it’s over, the party’s over
The party’s over, it’s over, the party’s over
The party’s over, it’s over, the party’s over
The party’s over, it’s fuckin’ over
It’s over now
Yeah it’s over now
It’s over now
Yeah it’s over now

Done
The party is done
It’s over and done
The damage is done
The politics done
Hypocrisy done
The party is done
It’s over and done
It’s over and done

The party’s over, it’s over, the party’s over
The party’s over, it’s over, the party’s over
The party’s over, it’s over, the party’s over
The party’s over, the party’s over, the party’s over
It’s fuckin’ over and done
The party is done
It’s over and done
The damage is done
The politics done
Hypocrisy done
The party is done
It’s over and done
It’s over and done
Done
Done
Done
It’s over and done
