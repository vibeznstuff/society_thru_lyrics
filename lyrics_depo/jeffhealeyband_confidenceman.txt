Well, I lost you at the border when you crossed it
Had your number, baby, but I lost it
I know your love was just a flimflam
No, you can't pull the wool over me, 'cause I'm a confidence man

I can talk old ladies out of all of their money
I can talk young girls into calling me honey
You can talk all you want, babe, but I got fast hands, uh-huh
You're a real soft touch, but I'm a confidence man

I know your mother taught you how to bake a cherry pie 
And read a book
Your daddy taught you how to tell a lie
And not get shook
Let me tell you something, baby, you better learn
If you're gonna con the con man, you're liable to get burned

Now, now, now, we were stretched out on the floor, baby, it's all elastic
But you stretched it too tight and it snapped like plastic
And the pieces went flying across the badlands
No discouraging word could be heard, 'cause I'm a confidence man

Now, maybe Chicago is where you're bound
But love is a cheap perfume, it hangs around
And you roll the dice, now let the bet stand
No, you can't pull the wool over me, 'cause I'm a confidence man
No, you can't pull the wool over me, 'cause I'm a confidence man
Said, you can't pull the wool over me, 'cause I'm a confidence man
