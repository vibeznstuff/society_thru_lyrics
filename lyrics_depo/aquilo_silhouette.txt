Stood at the coal face, stood with our backs to the sun
I can remember being nothing but fearless and young
We've become echoes, but echoes that fade away
We fall into the dark as we dive under the way (I heard you say)

The devils on your shoulder
Strangers in your head
As if you don't remember
As if you can forget
It's only been a moment
It's only been a lifetime
But tonight you're a stranger or some silhouette

Let's go out in flames so everyone knows who we are
Cause these city walls never knew that we'd make it this far
We've become echoes, but echoes that faded away
So let's dance like two shadows burning out our glory days

The devils on your shoulder
Strangers in your head
As if you don't remember
As if you can forget
It's only been a moment
It's only been a lifetime
But tonight you're a stranger or some silhouette

Just hold me
Just hold me
Just hold me
Just hold me

The devils on your shoulder
Strangers in your head
As if you don't remember
As if you can forget
It's only been a moment
It's only been a lifetime
But tonight you're a stranger or some silhouette
It's only been a moment
It's only been a lifetime
But tonight you're a stranger or some silhouette
But tonight you're a stranger or some silhouette
