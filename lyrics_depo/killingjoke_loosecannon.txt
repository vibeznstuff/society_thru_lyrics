This is the day
Tale orders
This is the life
Don't comply
This is the end of nations' borders
These are the fears I'm trying to hide
I'm a loose cannon

This is the day the sky turned green
This is the day I saw in my dream
These are the fears I'm trying to hide
These are the tears trapped inside
I'm an urban animal
Still a primitive man
I'm an urban animal
One step from a cannibal

I'm a loose cannon

I'm an urban animal
Still a primitive man
I'm an urban animal
One step from a cannibal

I'm a loose cannon
