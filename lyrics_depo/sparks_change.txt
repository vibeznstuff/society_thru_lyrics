The rain is falling down
I feel like a dog that's been kicked out into the street
I know that dogs can't drive cars
But that's about the only difference between us now
But wait, there's a rainbow over the freeway
And I think I feel the morning sun
Another song is number one
Golden days have just begun
Change. Every dog is gonna have his day
Change. Every loser's gonna have his way
Change. I don't care what other people say
Well, you can't argue all day long about whether love really exists or not
It's a complete waste of time
Like arguing about whether Santa Claus really exists or not
I got better things to do with my time
I got places that I've gotta be
And people that I've got to see
Mountains that I have to ski
Golden days ahead of me
Change. Every dog is gonna have his day
Change. Every loser's gonna have his way
Change. I don't care what other people say
Change. I know everything will be OK
Paradise was here, paradise is gone
Greece and Rome were here, Greece and Rome are gone
The Wild West was here, the Wild West is gone
Vaudeville was here, vaudeville is gone
Change. Every dog is gonna have his day
Change. I don't care what other people say
You know I've been thinkin' we'll get bck together again someday
Your hair will be some weird color by then
Maybe we'll just start off again as friends
I wonder when
Change. Every dog is gonna have his day
Change. Every loser's gonna have his way
Change. I don't care what other people say
Change. I know everything will be OK
Change. Every dog is gonna have his day
Change. Every loser's gonna have his way
Change. I don't care what other people say
Change. Just ignore them and they'll go away
