Well, I'm sittin' in the back porch
On the north-west side of town
Picturing last night way up in the city
Where they shot my baby down

She could be dyin', oh, oh, no
Well, it can't much matter to you
I found her lyin', yeah, yeah, yeah
Near the ball park down at school

The sheriff came on to question my brother
I could have dropped down through the floor
Before I could turn round, he was runnin' for cover
Like a billy goat through the door

She could be dyin', oh, oh, no
Well, it can't much matter to you
I found her lyin', yeah, yeah, yeah
Near the ball park down at school

Hold on, baby, I need you, honey
Won't you bring yourself around
You've gotta help me, help me, mama
I'm gonna rip this crazy town

She could be dyin', oh, oh, no
Well, it can't much matter to you
I found her lyin', yeah, yeah, yeah
Near the ball park down at school

The sheriff came on to question my brother
I could have dropped down through the floor
Before I could turn round, he was runnin' for cover
Like a billy goat through the door

She could be dyin', oh, oh, no
Well, it can't much matter to you
I found her lyin', yeah, yeah, yeah
Near the ball park down at school

Well, I'm sittin' in the back porch
On the north-west side of town
Picturing last night way up in the city
Where they shot my baby down

She could be dyin', oh, oh, no
Well, it can't much matter to you
I found her lyïn', yeah, yeah, yeah
Near the ball park down at school
