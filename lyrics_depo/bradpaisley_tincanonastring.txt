After the breakup,
I really thought we'd make up.
Give her a little time, I'd be on her mind
And suddenly she'd wake up.
But today if you listen,
Softly off in the distance,
Somewhere 'cross town, you can hear the sound
Of wedding bells ringing.
And there's bird seed on the concrete,
And she's waving goodbye

And they're driving away
And everybody cheerin' them on as the taillights fade
Yeah she's really gone,
I thought someday that would be me
But now she's driving away in that limousine
And I'm holdin' on
Like a tin can on a string.

Somewhere in my mind,
I'm the one by her side.
In that backseat, talkin' 'bout the beach
And that honeymoon flight.
I'd play the whole thing out,
From the kids to the house,
To the future that we always dreamed about.
But there's bird seed on the concrete,
And back here in reality

She's driving away
And everybody cheerin' them on as the taillights fade
Yeah she's really gone,
I thought someday that would be me
But now she's driving away in that limousine
And I'm holdin' on
Like a tin can on a string.

I thought someday that would be me
But now she's driving away in that limousine
And I'm not ready to let go of everything
So I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on
Like a tin can on a string.
