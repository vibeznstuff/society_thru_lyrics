Put Your Hands In The Air Baby

There's a girl dancing dirty over there
Do you see what I see
The way she moves I just had to stop and stare
Do you see what I see

There's a dj playing all our favourite songs
Do you hear what I hear
We be drinking so we all just sing along
Do you hear what I hear

Dancing with you is so easy cos your beautiful
You make it hard for me girl everytime we're on the floor
I wanna kiss you cos I gotta know that tonight is real
Do you feel what I feel
Do you feel what I feel
Do you feel what I feel
This beat is killing the club
Do you feel what I feel
Two people falling in love

Now the bar tenders turning on the lights
Do you see what I see
Got my car and its waiting outside
You should leave when I leave

Dancing with you is so easy cos your beautiful
You make it hard for me girl everytime we're on the floor
I wanna kiss you cos I gotta know that tonight is real
Do you feel what I feel
Do you feel what I feel
Do you feel what I feel
This beat is killing the club
Do you feel what I feel
Two people falling in love

Can you feel the temperature rising
Do you feel the drink in your cup
Let me cast a beat and we'll ride it
Go ahead and put your hands up

Can you feel the temperature rising
Do you feel the drink in your cup
Let me cast a beat and we'll ride it

Put your hands in the air baby
Put your hands up (put your hands up)
