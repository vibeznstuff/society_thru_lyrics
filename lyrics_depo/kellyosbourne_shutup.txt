You say,
I should do it differently.
I don't,
Necessarily agree. 
Stand up!
Sit down! 
Be nice!
Did ya hear me ask for your advice?

Don't bother,
Trying to tell me your beliefs.
Your point of view is pretty screwed to me.
Do this! 
Do that!
On track!
Do me a favor and don't talk back!

Round and round,
But the conversation always ends where it began.
Round and round, 
And I need a vacation.
I got a headache from you

Shut up! 
Don't want to hear your voice.
Shut up! 
I'm sick of all the noise.
There's nothing you can say
That means a damn thing to me.
Shut up!

Blah Blah, Blah Blah, Blah Blah, Blah Blah. 

That's what,
It sounds like you said to me.
You nag and you brag and I gag,
There's so much beauty in what we have.

You must,
Have better things that you can do.
Or does 
Your life revolve around me too?
What you want, 
What I need. 
Oh please!
I think you get off,
On hearing yourself speak.

Round and round, 
But the conversation always ends where it began.

Shut up! 
Don't want to hear your voice.
Shut up! 
I'm sick of all the noise.
There's nothing you can say
That means a damn thing to me.
Shut up!

Don't want to be polite.
It's messed up, 
How you always think you're right.
There's nothing you can say,
That's gonna change the way I am.
Shut up!
