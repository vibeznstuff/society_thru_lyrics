Two gal on my side, me in the middle
Into her foreign like Lidl
Bad B a caller, a sniggle, yeah she wan' wiggle
I'm a P.I.M.P left her brain in a pickle

Got two gal on my line
One is official, one heard the other one, I think I'm in a pickle
Niggas wanna screw, I just giggle
Remember when I never had a nickel
Now I'm counting money when I fiddle


You see me hop out the minivan
You never see the way I came, looking like a fisherman
I can't stop I'm a busy man, holding fire for hella man
You see me hop out the minivan
You never see the way I came, looking like a fisherman
I can't stop I'm a busy man, holding fire for hella man


My lifes a movie, fuck a cinema
Sorry I won't be home for dinner ma, put the food in the microwave
I spot a catfish from miles away, dog filter to hide your face
You ain't a winner your a weiner
Move that girls she's too inna
Can't see me, John Cena
She fell in love with a cheater, but she gon' cry if I leave
She keeps calling me, she just wants all of me
I told you stay far from me, I told her stay far from me
But she's like "Nah man I love ya"
But I can't love a chick cause I'm a hustler
And I'm with Hus and Mist, they wanna touch us
But they can't touch a thing, cause you're a buster
You won't buss your ting


You see me hop out the minivan
You never see the way I came, looking like a fisherman
I can't stop I'm a busy man, holding fire for hella man
You see me hop out the minivan
You never see the way I came, looking like a fisherman

I'm the lengman in the rain
One girl by my side by the name of Lorraine
She complain 'cah all the fishes wanna follow me
She know me too well cause she study criminology
I'm all about quality not quantity
Grab the bunda 'cause it's my property
You can look but don't touch it please
'Cause I'm the jealous and that bothers me
'Cause man are smoking fat head, like they never told ya
Just smoked a fat egg, I'm never sober
Fisherman slash Casanova
Guarantee I get my ting before the dance is over
Before the dance is dun up
Real fisherman make stoosh girl get tun up
Might roll with the pinga one up
Real fisherman please don't get bun up

You see me hop out the minivan
You never see the way I came, looking like a fisherman
I can't stop I'm a busy man, holding fire for hella man
