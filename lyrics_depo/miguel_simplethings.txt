She said, I don't want a model
I don't want a movie star
You don't have to win the lotto
I want you to win my heart
Yeah, she said I just want someone true
She said I just want someone to, smoke with me babe
And lay with me babe
And laugh with me babe
I just want the simple things
Smoke with me babe
And laugh with me baby
And lay with me baby
Cause I just want the simple things
I just want you
Yeah, yeah
I want you
Yeah, yeah

I said, No I don't need a model
I don't need a debutant
Just be a tough act to follow
You know, a free spirit, with a wild heart
Alright, I said I just want someone real, someone true
I said I just want someone else

Smoke with me baby
And lay with me baby
Laugh with me baby girl
I just want the simple things
Smoke with me baby
Lay with me baby
Laugh with me baby
