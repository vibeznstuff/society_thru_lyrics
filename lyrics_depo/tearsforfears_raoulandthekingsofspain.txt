When the seventh son of the seventh son
Comes along and breaks the chain
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and the kings of Spain
Making it plain, making it sane
To turn this loss into a gain

Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and the kings of Spain
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and the kings of Spain

Did you know your father was an island
Did you know your mother was the sea
Can we ever hope to seek asylum
From the bounds of fate and family

When the seventh son of the seventh son
Comes along and breaks the chain
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and the kings of Spain
Making it plain, making it sane
To turn this loss into a gain

Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and the kings of Spain
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and the kings of Spain

Did you know all mothers come from heaven
Did you know all fathers come from hell
That is why they're at sixes and sevens
That is why their marriage isn't well (not well)

When the seventh son of the seventh son
Comes along and breaks the chain
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and the kings of Spain
Making it plain, making it sane
To turn this loss into a gain

Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and the kings of Spain
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and the kings of Spain
