I know that it's over but I still reminise
'Bout the very first time that I saw you
And the first time that we kissed
I still recall the days of good old love we made
Without taking off our clothes
you spoke a language to my body baby
So universal, you and me talking baby
Ooh ahhh, oh my, ooh la la la la
Uhh uhh, uhh uhh
Speaking in tongues babe with you

Maybe we could exchange
A little conversation
315-37 69 call me boy anytime
Don't need no caller id, 'cause I won't have anybody
Interrupting our call
Talk dirty to me baby without talking at all
you got me singin' baby

Ooh ahhh, oh my, ooh la la la la
Uhh uhh, uhh uhh
Speaking in tongues babe with you

How do we play pretend
How do we do not sin
And be together making love forever
Then I will fantasize
Make you up in my mind
And intimately I will cry

Ooh ahhh, oh my, ooh la la la la
Uhh uhh, uhh uhh
Speaking in tongues babe with you
