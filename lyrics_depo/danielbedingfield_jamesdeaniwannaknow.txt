I could be james Dean of the Music scene
I could be a big star like that man called Queen
I could have fly moves, be a dancefloor dream
But If she can't seem to notice me
Then what's it worth now

Could have my teeth flashing a Brad Pit smile
Be wearing Versace 'cause that's my style
Could have my hair cut by the extra mile
But if she can't make it worth my while
Then what's the point now

I wanna know if youâ€™re busy
I wanna know if you're doing anything tonight
I wanna know if you missed me
I wanna know baby
I wanna know
I wanna know

I wish that I could kiss your lips
The way that I 
I want to baby
I wish that I could be your man
I wish that you could be my lady

I could be sly stone of the family crew
I could be big Bad Daddy Warbucks
And love you to
I could be knocked senseless by what you do
But if it's pain that you put me through
It isn't love now
I made up my own darn mind
I'm getting no love after all this time
I'm gonna make music till my brain is fried
Because you can't see the man inside
