Friends, tell me I am crazy
That I'm wasting time with you
You'll never be mine
Just be good to me


Ha, Just be good to green
All I need is a woman to be good to me
I'm an easy man, I'm easily pleased
An you provide me with everything that I need
Look you know I make ends I grind
So hold onto yours we're spending mine
Though you try I never let you buy
But If I was broke would you still be spending time?
 Yes
An I believe you would
Don't think p's to fucked to treat you good
I walk street with you, talk deep with you
Even slip an spend all week with you
Then I'm off, you wish I'd put an end to the torment
Stop, but one thing it's not ever is boring
What would you rather me be like?
I ain't ever gonna change are you ever gonna realise?

 Always talk about
 Look, people are always gonna talk babes,
 Reputation
 I ain't even gonna lie 
shit, but it ain't like you don't know what mine is
 I don't care what you do to them
 Nah
 Just be good to me
 I'll try, an try, an try


Look babes, you know who I am
But as crooked as I am
I'll be as good as I can
I try an try though its evident my
Angel face is disguise for the devil inside
You're good to me, I ain't good to girls, ME?
I'm a bad boy something every good girl needs, heh
Honesty could avoid all your tantrums
But I'm a naughty boy and I always have been
WHAT
An that ain't changing any time soon
I can't have you with me whenever I move
Whatever I do, I come back to you,
See the good attracts me and the crook attracts you
 Whatever
 What
We've all got our ways
Remember us talking?
Of course it was game
But it's all gone an changed
Now she's got me cutting of links like I'm trying to shorten my chain

 Always talk about
 Look, people are always gonna talk babes,
 Reputation
 I ain't even gonna lie
shit, but it ain't like you don't know what mine is
 I don't care what you do to them
 Nah
 Just be good to me
 I'll try, an try, an try

 
Friends are always telling me
You're a user
 Not me not ever, 
ain't no other man gonna treat you better
 I don't care what you do to them
 Nah

 I'll try, and try, and try

I'll be good to you
You'll be good to me
We can be together be together
I'll be good to you
You'll be good to me
We can be together be together
Just be good to me

Why you always listening to them?
Why you always gotta listen to your friends?
