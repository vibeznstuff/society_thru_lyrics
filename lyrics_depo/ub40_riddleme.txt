Riddle me who, riddle me why, answer me this
Who owns the chains that bind your wrists
Riddle me who, riddle me why, answer again
Riddle me who built the machine
That washed your brain

Like parents did before them
Your parents did the same
They said do your best, you must pass the test
You must learn to play the game
They scrimped and saved and suffered
To send you off to school
But if they'd had the cash
They could've brought the class
And a different set of rules



They taught a simple system
Why they had and you had not
They said know your place, you can't win the race
Life's an auction you're the lot
If you'd ever thought to question
They would never answer you why
When they buy your sweat, you are in their debt
And they own you till you die



You took hook line and sinker
Everything they fed
Worked day and night, for most your life
To earn their daily bread
Now your old and weary
And you lay you down to sleep
With body worn and spirit torn
What's left is yours to keep
