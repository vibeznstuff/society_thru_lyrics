You can do anything you want 
As long as it makes sense 
You can do anything you want 
As long as it makes sense 

What a long haul it's been 
My old and trusted friend 
Don't think I'm being mean 
Just can't find a gift to send 

You didn't portray a sign 
Not a tremble of the limb 
In life were all duffels chum 
Of all wisdom this is the sum 

You can't fool me Dennis 
You can't fool me Dennis 
You can't fool me Dennis 
No, you can't fool me Dennis 

You can do anything you want 
As long as it makes sense 
You can do anything you want 
As long as it makes sense 

Remember those barmy days 
Through a rose-tinted haze 
Pal, you weren't a cypher 
Pal, you were a man! 
All the students drove a van 

Well, it always pays to be brave 
From the cradle to the grave 
When the cat be friended the mouse 
There wasn't a dry eye in the house 

You can't fool me Dennis 
You can't fool me Dennis 
You can't fool me Dennis 
You can't fool me Dennis 

You can't fool me Dennis 
You can't fool me Dennis 
You can't fool me Dennis 
No, you can't fool me Dennis 

I know there's something a miss 
You can't fool me Dennis 
Knock me in a cocked hat 
You always played with a straight bat 

I know, I know, I know, I know...
