You want me to come over
I got an excuse
Might be holding your hand
But I'm holding it loose
Go to talk then we choke
It's like our necks in a noose
Avoid the obvious
We should be facing the truth

Start to think it could be fizzling out
Kinda shocked because I never really had any doubts
Look into your eyes, imagine life without ya

And the love kickstarts again
Starts again
And the love kickstarts again
Starts again

It's the same old you, the same old me
You get bored and I get cold feet
Get high, get wandering eyes
Forget I've never ever had it so sweet
I realise what I got when I'm out of town
Cause deep down you're my girl in a golden crown
My princess and I don't wanna let you down
No I don't wanna let you down, down, down, down

You want me to come over
I got an excuse
Might be holding your hand
But I'm holding it loose
Go to talk then we choke
It's like our necks in a noose
Avoid the obvious
We should be facing the truth

Start to think it could be fizzling out
Kinda shocked because I never really had any doubts
Look into your eyes and imagine life without ya

It kickstarts again

Start to think it could be fizzling out
Kinda shocked because I never really had any doubts
Look into your eyes and imagine life without ya

And the love kickstarts again
Starts again
And the love kickstarts again
Starts again

It's the same old you the same old me
You get bored and I get cold feet
Get high get wandering eyes
Forget I've never ever had it so sweet
I realise what I got when I'm out of town
Cause deep down you're my girl in a golden crown
My princess and I don't wanna let you down
No I don't wanna let you down, down, down, down

It kickstarts again

Start to think that it could be fizzling out
Kinda shocked because I never really had any doubts
Look into your eyes and imagine life without ya

And the love kickstarts again
