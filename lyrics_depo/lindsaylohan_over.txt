I watched the walls around me crumble
But its not like I won't build them up again
So here's your last chance for redemption
So take it while it lasts because it will end
And my tears are turning into time I've wasted trying to find a reason for goodbye


I cant live without you
Can't breathe without you I dream about you honestly
Tell me that its over
Because if the world is spinning and I'm still living
It wont be right if were not in it together
Tell me that it's over

And I'll be the first to go
Don't want to be the last to know

I won't be the one to chase you
But at the same time you're the heart that I call home
I'm always stuck with these emotions
And the more I try to feel the less I'm whole
My tears are turning into time
I've wasted trying to find a reason for goodbye



My tears are turning into time
I've wasted trying to find a reason for goodbye



Tell me that it's over
Over
Honestly tell me
Honestly tell me
Don't tell me that its over 
Don't tell me that its over..
