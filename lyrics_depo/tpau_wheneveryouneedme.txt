I came to see if you will listen to me now
Came to atone
For all the wrong I have done
Won't you forgive a stupid girl
Who didn't realise she owned the world till you
Left me alone

I won't make the same mistake
And let the fate
Of some poor fool who never knew
The beauty of a precious love
Come fill my heart
Can't we go back to the start

Whenever you need me now
In a world without love
If you hear the song again
Don't make it a requiem
If we put this aside oh I'm sure
We could talk and make up our own minds
Make it the best of times again

Can you believe I never knew the answer
Lay within you I
I went searching everywhere
Sometimes it's very hard
To see through the familiarity of what is there

But if you tell me I can't be
The one you need
I'm gonna shout it from a mountain high
I let our love be sacrificed
Threw it away
Please let me try it again

Whenever you need me now
In a world without love
If you hear the song again
Don't make it a requiem
We belong, we belong together
I'm gonna shout it from a mountain high
I let our love be sacrificed
Threw it away

Please let me try it again
we belong, we belong together
If you hear the song again
Don't make it a requiem

Whenever you need me now
In a world without love
If you hear the song again
Don't make it a requiem
If we push this aside believe me I'm sure
We could talk and make up our own minds
Make it the best of times again
You keep that in mind
Can we just try

Whenever you need me now
In a world without love
If you hear the song again
Don't make it a requiem
