Baby, you're driving me crazy I don't want anybody thinking about you
In the way that I'm thinking about you Oh baby
Don't think you know me maybe
Cause I know that you're feeling like I do
And right now's the time to talk to you

No matter what happens I ain't giving it up
Every single day I'm falling deeper in love
I ain't never ever been so happy And I know why I'll tell you why

Cause I got sunshine every day
Pull up a sunbeam Everything's right yeah
Thoughts of you come breezing through
Why cause the clouds aren't in my way
Pull up a sunbeam Everything's right yeah
Summer days and nights just breeze on by

We know they just breeze on by

Oh this time don't give me excuses
Cause I wont take no for an answer
And I wont be letting go now that I found you
Oh lady wont you come and save me
Oh I can't imagine living without you
And right now's the time its up to you

You are everything that I ever desired
Loving that you give is just too good to hide
I'm never gonna stop and your gonna give in and why
I'll tell you why

Cause I got sunshine every day
Pull up a sunbeam
Everything's right yeah
Thoughts of you come breezing through
I cause the clouds aren't in my way
Pull up a sunbeam
Everything's right yeah

Summer days and nights just breeze on by

Cause I got sunshine every day
Pull up a sunbeam
Everything's right yeah
Thoughts of you come breezing through
I cause the clouds aren't in my way
Pull up a sunbeam
Everything's right yeah
Summer days and nights just breeze on by

No matter what happens I ain't giving it up
Every single day I'm falling deeper in love
I ain't never ever been so happy
And I know why, I know why
You are everything that I ever desired (my desire)
Loving that you give is just too good to hide
I'm never gonna stop and your gonna give in
And why, I'll tell you why

Cause I got sunshine everyday
Pull up a sunbeam
Everything's right yeah
Thoughts of you come breezing through
Why cause the clouds aren't in my way
Pull up a sunbeam
Everything's right yeah
