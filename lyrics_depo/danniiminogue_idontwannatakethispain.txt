(Got to get busy)
I don't wanna / I want you, I want you back
I don't wanna / I want you, I want you back
I don't, I, I, I, I don't wanna

I don't wanna take this pain anymore (more)
I don't wanna take this pain anymore (more)

Every night I used to dream of how it used to be
Spending time all alone with my fantasies
Searching for that special love that we shared

I never thought it would take so long
For time to come and heal my broken heart (heal my broken heart)
I want you back

I don't wanna take this pain anymore (more)
I don't wanna take this pain
I don't wanna take this pain anymore (more)
I don't wanna take this pain baby
No more, no more, no more
I'm gonna give you all my love this time, this time

You're always claiming you didn't mean to break my heart
Through the mirror of love, I can see the scars
What do I have to do, to get my message through to you
I'm losing sleep, I can't eat
Your love has got a hold on me

(There's no relief in sight) no relief in sight
If lovin' you is wrong then, wrong has got to be right
I want you back

I don't wanna take this pain anymore (more)
I don't wanna take this pain
I don't wanna take this pain anymore (more)

I'm gonna give you all my love this time

Hey girl, how could I let you slip away
Losin' you, a high price to pay
Sorry girl, because I made a mistake
Don't let the mistake turn into heartbreak
You were my princess
And I was your prince
I might sound conceited but I'm just convinced
There is no other lover that compares to this
Are you with it, or will you try to resist

Let's make the time to have a conversation
I wanna tell you what's deep inside my heart and my mind
I have no reservations
I'm gonna give you all my love this time

Hey boy, you wanna go steady with me
You betta treat this a little more seriously
True love, you don't know the meaning of
You broke my heart, I thought that we could never part
Now here you come with that sad old line again
I wonder if I should let you back in
I don't have time for games
I don't wanna take this pain

I don't wanna take this pain anymore (more)
I don't wanna take this pain baby
I don't wanna take this pain, no more
I don't wanna take this pain anymore (more)
I don't wanna take this pain 
I don't wanna take this pain
no more, no more, no more baby
I don't wanna take this pain
I don't wanna take this pain
No more, no more, no more baby
I don't wanna take this pain
