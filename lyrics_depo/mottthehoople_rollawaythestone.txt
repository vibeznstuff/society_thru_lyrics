Baby, if you just say you care
Follow you most anywhere
Roll away the stone, roll away the stone
And in the darkest night
I'll keep you safe and alright
Roll away the stone, roll away the stone

Won't you roll away the stone
Why be cold and so alone?
Won't you roll away the stone
Don't you let it die

No matter if fools say we can't win
I know I'll fall in love again
Roll away the stone, roll away the stone
So sing - we still got a chance
Baby, in love and sweet romance
Roll away the stone, roll away the stone

Won't you roll away the stone
Why be cold and so alone?
Won't you roll away the stone
Don't you let it die

There's a rockabilly party on Saturday night
Are you gonna be there?
(I got my invite)
Gonna bring your records
(Ohh, will do)
Made it

Won't you roll away the stone
Why be cold and so alone?
Won't you roll away the stone
Don't you let it die

Come on roll
Come on roll, yeah
Come on roll
I want you to roll
Come on, yeah
Come on roll
