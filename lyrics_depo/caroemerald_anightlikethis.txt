From where you are
You see the smoke start to arise where they play cards
And you walk over, softly moving passed the guards
The stakes are getting higher, you can feel it in your heart

He calls you bluff
He is the ace you never thought he played that much
And now it's more than all this cards you want to touch
You never know if winning this could really be enough

Take a look beyond the moon
You'll see the stars (mmm...)
And when you look around
You know the room by heart

I have never dreamed it
Have you ever dreamed a night like this
I cannot believe it
I may never see a night like this
When everything you think is incomplete
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek
Could you ever dream it
I have never dreamed, dreamed a night like this

How many times
Have I been waiting by the door to hear these chimes
To hear that someone debonair has just arrived
And opened up to see my world before my eyes

That silhouette 
creates an image and a night I can't forget
It has the scent of something special, I can't rest
If I resist temptation, oh I know for sure that I will lose the bet

I walk away and suddenly it seems
I'm not alone (mmm...)
In front of me he stands
I stop before he goes

I have never dreamed it
Have you ever dreamed a night like this
I cannot believe it
I may never see a night like this
When everything you think is incomplete
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek
Could you ever dream it
I have never dreamed, dreamed a night like this

Mmm...
Mmm...

I have never dreamed it
Have you ever dreamed a night like this
I cannot believe it
I may never see a night like this
When everything you think is incomplete
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek
Could you ever dream it
I have never dreamed, dreamed a night like this
