Word is bond

I will love you any way baby any way and every way I can
'Cause I'm that kind of man
I will give you everything baby
Give you more than any girl can stand
I'm gonna love you baby, baby, baby, baby

I'm talking 'bout makin' love in the shower
At least an hour
And let you dangle in my arms
'Cause love is power
Can you feel it the sky's the limit
Once you reveal it
Your heart was wounded
God sent me to heal it
On a mission ain't no stress love
Touch you with precision
Just undress love
I know the right position
Come one trust me girl
Throw this rock up on your hand
I'll give you the world
Yo Face
On the real
Was the honey looking laced

Ooh baby baby baby

This is for the lover in you
This ring means I'll always be true
This is how we'll start love anew
This time it's gonna last forever

I will love you all the way baby
Girl this means this love will never end
I'll be your lover and your friend
I will take you anywhere baby
Just say when and girl I'll take you there
I'm gonna take you baby, baby, baby, baby

We're going from Tahiti to France
To Italy in one night
Drop top Bentley coupe parked in the spotlight
And you can drive it laced in all white
I'm wearin' triple black
Our gear is top flight
Trips to venice
The man of steel when I'm in this
A match made in heaven
When we blend this
Lovers everlasting
In other words endless
To love any other man
Would be senseless
Yo Face
On the real
Was the honey looking laced

Ooh baby baby baby



Ladies and gentlemen Howard Hewett

I can say I never met a girl no, no
Who satisfied my mental and physical thing
When I lay me down to sleep and I rest assured
With the thought that you are right
Right next to me



It's for the lover in you baby
With this ring I'll show you
There ain't no maybe
It's for the lover in you baby
This time it's gonna last forever

It's for the lover in you baby
It's for the lover in you baby
This time it's gonna last forever

It's for the lover in you baby
It's for the lover in you baby
This time it's gonna last forever
