Your eyes, tell me how you want me
I can feel it in your heart beat
I know you like what you see
Hold me, I'll give you all that you need
Wrap your love around me
You're so excited, 
I can feel you getting hotter, oh baby

I'll take you down, I'll take you down
Where no one's ever gone before
And if you want more, if you want more
More, more

Then, Jump!
For my love
Jump in!
And feel my touch
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then,
Jump for my love
I know my heart can make you happy
Jump in! 
You know these arms can feel you up
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then,
Jump! For my love

You told me, I'm the only woman for you
Nobody does you like I do
Then make a move before you try
And go much farther, oh baby
You are the one, you, you are the one
And heaven waits here at my door
And if you want more,
If you want more, more, more

Then, Jump!
For my love
Jump in!
And feel my touch
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then,
Jump for my love
I know my heart can make you happy
Jump in! 
You know these arms can feel you up
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then,
Jump! For my love

When you are next to me, (Oooo)
Oh, I come alive (yeah)
Your love hurts inside (Oooo)
Oh, it feels so right (Yeah)
Come to me if you want me tonight (Jump)

I know my heart can make you happy
Jump in! 
You know these arms can feel you up
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then,
Jump! For my love
