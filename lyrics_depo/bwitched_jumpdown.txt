I woke up to find your face on my mind
The sun always shines on my garden
I told you before, just knock on my door
'Cause you know the score, it's my party

You ran away with my spoon
You've stolen my heart, always laughin'
I jumped over moon, right from the start
You always make me feel good

Jump down, I've never believed in love
Till now I've never believed in us
Jump down, I've never believed
I've never believed in love
That's why I'm letting you know

You're always around stamping the ground
The letter I found was yours truly
So plain to see what you wrote to me
Was positively unruly

You ran away with my spoon
You've stolen my heart, always laughin'
I jumped over moon, right from the start
You always make me feel, always make me feel good

Jump down, I've never believed in love
Till now I've never believed in us
Jump down, I've never believed
I've never believed in love
That's why I'm letting you know

Whoa, letting you know
Whoa, I don't want you to go
Oh, you make me feel good

Jump down, I've never believed in love
Till now I've never believed in us
Jump down, I've never believed
I've never believed in love
Yeah, yeah, letting you know

Jump down, I've never believed in love
Till now I've never believed in us
Jump down, I've never believed
I've never believed in love
That's why I'm letting you know

Jump down
