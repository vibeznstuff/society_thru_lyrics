Don't
Don't play with her, don't be dishonest
Still not understanding this logic
Aye, I'm back and I'm better
I want you bad as ever
Don't let me just let up
I wanna give you better
Baby, it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Girl, I'm that somebody
So I'm next up

Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level
Girl, he only fucked you over 'cause you let him

Fuck 'em, girl, I guess he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together

Lately you say he been killing the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up skirt
Get in the ride
Left hand is steering, the other is gripping your thigh
Light up a spliff and get high
Shawty, you deserve what you been missing
Looking at you I'm thinking he must be tripping
Play this song for him tell him just listen

Don't play this song for him.
Don't

Girl, said he keeps on playing games
And his loving ain't the same
I don't know what to say-ay but
What a shame
If you were mine you would not get the same
If you were mine you would top everything
Suicide in the drop switching lanes
And that thang so fire, baby, no propane
Got good pussy, girl, can I be frank
To keep it 100, girl, I ain't no saint
But he the only reason that I'm feeling this way
Giving you the world, baby, when you get space
Pen game get me laid, baby, that's penetrate
Oh, baby

Don't play this song for him.
Ey

H-Town got a nigga so throwed
Po' up we can party some mo'
Yeah got this drink in my cup
Got a young nigga feeling so throwed
Spit fire and the world so cold
Young money got a nigga feeling old
Spit fire and the world so cold
H-Town got me feeling so throwed
H-Town got me feeling so throwed
Raw paint in the sip can it fold
H-Town got me feeling so throwed
Spit fire and the world so cold
H-Town got a nigga so throwed

Play this song for em.

Don't
