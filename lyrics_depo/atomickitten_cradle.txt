Cradle 
I will rock you like a baby, I will,
Cradled in my arms,
I will keep you safe from danger,
Shelter you from harm...

There will never be another lover,
Who treats you like I do,
We can drift into forever,
On a love thats made for two...

Dont you ever say this loves not special,
Dont you ever think its not essential...
Baby...

I was only thinkin of you,
Hopin you were thinkin of me,
Two hearts beating just like one,
Agaisnt the world...
Baby...

I am always dreamin of you,
Hopin you are dreamin of me,
I could never live,
One day without your love...

I will kiss you like an angel, baby,
Cradled in my wings,
I will take you up to heaven,
Show you precious things...

If you promise that you love me,
If you promise that you care,
I will be here for you always,
And forever this I swear...

Dont you ever say this loves not special,
Dont you ever think its not essential...
Baby...

I was only thinkin of you,
Hopin you were thinkin of me,
Two hearts beating just like one,
Agaisnt the world...
Baby...

I am always dreamin of you,
Hopin you are dreamin of me,
I could never live one day,
Without your love...

Though you say you want a love,
But you dont think you believe it,
Just open up your heart,
And you know you will recieve it...
Oh baby...

Baby...
Dont you ever say this loves not special, oh
Dont you ever think its not essential...
Baby...

I was only thinkin of you,
Hopin you were thinkin of me,
Two hearts beating just like one,
Agaisnt the world...
Baby...

I was only dreamin of you,
Hopin you were dreamin of me,
I could never live one day,
Without your love...

I was only, I was only, I was only thinkin of you...
I was only, I was only, I was only thinkin of you...
I was only, I was only, I was only thinkin of you...
i was only, i was only, i was only thinkin... oh baby
