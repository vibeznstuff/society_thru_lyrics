There's
Some
One
Else

Let it go, I just can't forget about her
How do you know, if you can really be sure?
But I can't move on, I'm sorry that I loved her first
She's the only one, she's the only one, I want

There's (I can't believe I feel this way)
Some (I can't believe I'm 'bout to say)
One (I can't believe I feel this way)
Else

Let it go, I just can't forget about her
How do you know, if you can really be sure?
But I can't move on, I'm sorry that I loved her first
She's the only one, she's the only one, I want
