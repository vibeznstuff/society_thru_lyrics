She got her daddy's tongue and temper
Sometimes her mouth could use a filter
God shook his head the day he built her
Oh, but I bet he smiled

She loves and lives her life, unruly
Tears up that dirt road up in a dualy
Dangerous, absolutely
And in a little while

She'll be roundin' that corner on three wheels
Ain't slowin down, yellin, "Come on, jump in"
Always up to somethin, crazy, got nothin' on her

She ain't right
She ain't right
She ain't right
But she's just right for me

She says she wants to meet my momma
I said, "I don't think you oughta
Be like mixin' oil and water"
But by midnight, she had

Momma on the coffee table, dancin'
Comin' unwound
Good God, I swear, can't take her anywhere
What's the girl gonna do next?

She ain't right
She ain't right
She ain't right
But she's just right for me

Every once in a while, she gives me that smile
And says, "I just don't see somebody like you
Lovin' somebody like me"

She ain't right
No, she ain't right
She ain't right

She ain't right
She ain't right
But she's just right, she's just right
She's just right for me
Mmm, she's just right, she's just right
She ain't right but she's just right for me
