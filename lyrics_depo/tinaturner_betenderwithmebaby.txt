YOU GOT THE RIGHT TO TELL ME
IT'S ALL OVER
IT ISN'T LIKE ME TO BE
BEGGING YOU
DON'T LET GO DON'T LET GO
JUST STAY WITH ME ANOTHER DAY
WHEN I'M NOT MYSELF
PLEASE UNDERSTAND ME
I'M SO CONFUSED I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
BUT DON'T GIVE UP
DON'T GIVE UP
IT JUST MAY TAKE A LITTLE TIME
BE TENDER WITH ME BABY
I'M SO AFRAID YOU'LL GO AWAY
BE TENDER WITH ME BABY ALWAYS
I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN PATIENT
WITH MY WEAKNESS
AND THAT YOU HATE TO SEE ME CRY
BUT I KNOW YES I KNOW
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY
BUT I'M SO LONELY I COULD DIE
BE TENDER WITH ME BABY
I'M SO AFRAID YOU'LL GO AWAY
BE TENDER WITH ME BABY ALWAYS
WHY DOES MY HEART KEEP ON LONGING
WHY DO I FEEL LIKE I DO
I HOPE YOU SEE THIS IS NOT REALLY ME
THIS IS JUST A PHASE THAT I'M GOING THROUGH
BE TENDER WITH ME BABY
BE TENDER WITH ME BABY
I'M SO AFRAID YOU'LL GO AWAY
BE TENDER WITH ME BABY
FOR ALWAYS ALWAYS
BE TENDER WITH ME BABY
I'M SO AFRAID YOU'LL GO AWAY
BE TENDER WITH ME BABY
ALWAYS FOR ALWAYS ALWAYS
