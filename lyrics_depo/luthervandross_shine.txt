It's about to be on
It's about to be on

Ya'll came here to give it up
So come on and show me what you got
It's about to be on baby non-stop
Tonight you're gonna get your time to shine

Nobody but stars in here tonight
Dancing underneath the party light
When I see you working that body right
Tonight you're gonna get your time to shine

I've been waiting, now I'm ready for the main event
All the ladies and the players in here dressed to kill
Choose a winner who has flavor looking on for style
Only the best can pass the test, let me check you out

In the midst of a fierce competition
Get a view from a better position
A little closer now you got my attention
Maybe your my, my, my, my, my superstar

Keep showing me moves that are blazing
'Cause you're teasing my imagination
Don't believe I can fight temptation
I think you already know that

Ya'll came here to give it up
So come on and show me what you got
It's about to be on baby non-stop
Tonight you're gonna get your time to shine

Nobody but stars in here tonight
Dancing underneath the party light
When I see you working that body right
Tonight you're gonna get your time to shine

It's about to be on
Your time, your time to shine
Shine, shine, shine, shine groove shine
It's alright, alright to shine
Shine, shine, shine, shine it's alright

Spotlight search for someone special, could you be the one?
If you're not, then don't get jealous, just keep moving on
Feet to the beat, so hot the heat, springing off the shine
So clean, so fresh, a real good catch, so I'm gonna make you mine

In the midst of a fierce competition
Get a view from a better position
A little closer now you got my attention
Maybe your my, my, my, my, my superstar

Keep showing me moves that are blazing
'Cause you're teasing my imagination
Don't believe I can fight temptation
I think you already know that

Ya'll came here to give it up
So come on and show me what you got
It's about to be on baby non-stop
Tonight you're gonna get your time to shine

It's about to be on

Your time, your time to shine
Shine, shine, shine, shine groove shine
