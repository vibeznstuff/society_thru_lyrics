Lying here on my girl
Turn on the radio
Shame we had to bail
You know we put on quite a show
What am I going to do
Left on my answer phone
Tell them what I told you
Right know I just don't know

Hey kid
Don't you think you've got to try and be somebody
Yeah, it happens on it's own
Hey kid
you don't get along trying to be nobody else
That's god damned right you know

Every day will break
But another comes along
You won't have long to wait
And you've always got that song
It's funny when you're drunk
How everything is clear
Come check out my bunk
And get the rock right out of here

Hey kid
Don't you think you've got to try and be somebody
Yeah, it happens on it's own
Hey kid
you don't get along trying to be nobody else
That's god damned right you know

I'm feeling so much better in this frame of mind
Cos I've been sick thinking over all the difficult times and I know (you know)
I'm a capable guy
I got so many things I wanted to do
and I got the chance to prove it to you
(hey) on my own (on my own) 'cause I waited my life and I am ready to blow
When I do some thing I gotta win
I'm ready to start it all over again
And I need some patience from you...

Hey kid
Don't you think you've got to try and be somebody
Yeah, it happens on it's own
Hey kid
you don't get along trying to be nobody else
That's god damned right you know
Hey kid
Don't you think you've got to try and be somebody
Yeah, it happens on it's own
Hey kid
you don't get along trying to be nobody else
That's god damned right you know
