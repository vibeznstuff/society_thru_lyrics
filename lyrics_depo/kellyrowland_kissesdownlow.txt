You put in over time, over night, doing everything I like, go so right yeah
You hold me close, squeeze me tight, look me deep inside my eyes, baby you know I love it
But nothing can compare to when you kiss me there
And I can't lie when I lie in your arms baby I feel so sexy

So boy just take your time, send chills down my spine
You’re one of a kind, I swear I gotta make you mine

Boy you turn me on, got me feeling hot
