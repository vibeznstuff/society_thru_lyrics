The waves keep on crashing on me for some reason
But your love keeps on coming like a thunderbolt
Come here a little closer
'Cause I wanna see you, baby, real close up
(Get over here) 

You've got me feeling hella good 
So let's just keep on dancing
You hold me like you should 
So I'm gonna keep on dancing

A performance deserving of standing ovations
And who would have thought it'd be the two of us
So don't wake me if I'm dreaming
'Cause I'm in the mood come on and give it up

You've got me feeling hella good 
So let's just keep on dancing
You hold me like you should 
So I'm gonna keep on dancing
You've got me feeling hella good 
So let's just keep on dancing
You hold me like you should 
So I'm gonna keep on dancing

Ooh yeah yeah
Ooh yeah yeah

You've got me feeling hella good 
So let's just keep on dancing
You hold me like you should 
So I'm gonna keep on dancing
You've got me feeling hella good 
So let's just keep on dancing
You hold me like you should 
So I'm gonna keep on dancing

Keep on dancing
Keep on dancing
