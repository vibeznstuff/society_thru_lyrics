I still remember it was day number one
We hit the ground and then we started to run
Now we're connected and I won't turn around
Cause you set me free, put my soul at ease

I just can't stop the feeling
What you give is what I'm needing
I just won't stop believing
On and on it's only just begun

I'm feeling so alive
Make it last forever
Everyday is right
Whenever we're together
I'm so alive
And loving every minute
Underneath the sky there's a heaven for you and I

I feel so alive

Day number two and there's a difference in me
We're getting closer baby spiritually
I got this feeling it was just meant to be
There's an energy between you and me yeah

I just can't stop the feeling
What you give is what I'm needing
I just won't stop believing
On and on it's only just begun

I'm feeling so alive
Make it last forever
Everyday is right
Whenever we're together
I'm so alive
And loving every minute
Underneath the sky there's a heaven for you and I

Like a waterfall coming down on me
I can't go back cos I'm in too deep
You make me see those things that I never seen
You know the remedy, it's obvious to me

I'm feeling so alive
Make it last forever
Everyday is right
Whenever we're together
I'm so alive
And loving every minute
Underneath the sky there's a heaven for you...

I'm feeling so alive
Make it last forever
Everyday is right
Whenever we're together
I'm so alive
And loving every minute
Underneath the sky there's a heaven for you and I
