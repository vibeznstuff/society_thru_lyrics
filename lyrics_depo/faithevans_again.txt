Ohhhhhh
Ohhhhhh


Now I done felt a lot of pain 
I done seen a lot of things
From struggling and broken heart to fancy cars (oh yeah)
And even though my money change 
I tried my best to stay the same 
But you know with mo money 
Mo problems came 


If I had to do it all again 
I wouldn’t take away the rain 
Cuz I know it made me who I am 
If I had to do it all again 
I’ve learn so much from my mistakes that’s how I know he is watching me


In atl I caught a case 
And the media tried to say 
I had a habit 
I couldn’t manage and I am throwing my life away 
But everything ain’t what it seems just because its on TV 
Cuz they speculate and exaggerate for a better story   


If I had to do it all again 
I wouldn’t take away the rain 
Cuz I know it made me who I am 
If I had to do it all again 
I’ve learn so much from my mistakes that’s how I know he is watching me


Nobody knows what life may bring 
It might make you happy it might make you sad
Sometimes yeah but I know there’s a reason for everything (but I know)
That’s why I keep believing
Whatever is meant to be its going to be


If I had to do it all again 
I wouldn’t take away the rain 
Cuz I know it made me who I am 
If I had to do it all again 
I’ve learn so much from my mistakes that’s how I know he is watching me
