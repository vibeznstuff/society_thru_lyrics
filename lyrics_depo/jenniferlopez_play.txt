Could wait all night and day
To go to a party
Sit down and wait
Give my request to the DJ
'Cause my song he's gotta play
And when I hear that beat
I get my body up out my seat
Grab a guy and move my feet
He's playin' my song

Play, come on
Play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn me on
Play, come one DJ
Play that song
You that it turns me on
Just turn it up and turn me on

I don't care if everybody gone
Turn it up
'Cause it turns me on
Keep dancin' all night long
It feels so good that it can't be wrong
I get the chills up and down my spine
Whenever I hear that song of mine
When it stops better press rewind
Let me hear it
One more time

Play, come on
Play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn me on
Play, come one DJ
Play that song
You that it turns me on
Just turn it up and turn me on
