Rain and tears, are the same
But in the sun
You've got to play the game

When you cry
In winter time
You can pretend
It's nothing but the rain

How many times I've seen
Tears coming from your blue eyes

Rain and tears, are the same
But in the sun
You've got to play the game

Give me an answer, love
(o...ooohhh)
I need an answer,  love
(o...ooohhh)
Rain and tears in the sun
But in your heart
You feel the rainbow waves

Rain and tears
Both I shun
For in my heart there 'll never be a sun

Rain and tears, are the same
But in the sun
You've got to play the game
Game...
