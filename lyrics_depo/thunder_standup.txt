When you get up late for work in the morning
And somebody's broken into your car
Makes you feel like killing
Maybe you'd be willing
But you don't have to take it that far

Stand up, say who cares and stand up
Cos when things drag you down 
You can't take it sitting down
Stand up

You catch you girl making love with the postman
And they're doing it in your very own bed
She says he's giving her a letter,
I think you should forget her
And go out with her sister instead

Stand up, kick the cat and stand up
Don't go crying on the floor,
Just kick them out the door 
And stand up

Every now and then boy
You gotta take it on the chin
It's just another symptom of the world we're living in
Everydays a battle,
Sometimes you're gonna bruise
But if you let it get you down you'll lose
Stand up

Sit down

Sunday morning you relax with the papers
All week long you've been working so hard
Then you can't believe what you've seen on the page
About a road they're gonna build through you yard

Stand up, shout about it stand up
you don't have to beg them please
Don't go down on your knees 
Stand up
If they're gonna tread on you
make them think before they do
Stand up

Stand up, don't take it lyaing down
Stand up
