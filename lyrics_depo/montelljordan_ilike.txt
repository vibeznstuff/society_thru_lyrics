I like the way you walk
The sexy way you talk
Ooo I can't help myself
Baby I like
I like to kiss your lips
And when you move your hips
Ooo I can't help myself
Baby I like

Baby let me say what's on my mind
Take a little time to express myself
Honey I think you're fly
Now I don't have no problem
Saying what I like
I like to spend some time with you 
Starting with tonight and I like



Here's the situation
I lay here on the line
Meaningless relationships be wasting all my time
You are the special someone that I want to get to know
Baby can't you see it in my eye
I wanna take you home


Tonight lets take our time
Do it nice, do it slow
Baby we got nowhere to go
Oh I hope you don' t mind
Oh I'm coming on real strong
I give good lovin all night long




Make it hot Montell, make it hot
