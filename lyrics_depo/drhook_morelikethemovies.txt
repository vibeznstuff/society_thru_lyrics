I guess the dance is over now
So you just courstey, and I'll bow
And ask the band to play us Auld Lang Syne
And I'll just take whats left of me, right bak to where it used to be
And you'll go sail your magic carpet far across the sky

I wish I could have made it more like the movies for ya
Some pretty technicolour way thats never been
Im sorry when i kissed you, you only heard me whisper
You never got to hear those violins
Did ya girl?
No you never got to hear those violins, no

The castles that you built so high, were just to steep for me to climb
And I guess these dirty streets of mine, were just to rough for you
I wish I coulda helped you see
Just one of your sweet childhood dreams,
But though I tried I could not make not one of them come true

I wish I could have made it more like the movies for ya
Some pretty technicolour way thats never been
Im sorry when i kissed you, you only heard me whisper
You never got to hear those violins
Did ya girl?
No you never got to hear those violins, no

Ohhhhhhhhhh Im sorry when I kissed you, you only heard me whisper
You never got to hear those violins
No you never got to hear those violins
