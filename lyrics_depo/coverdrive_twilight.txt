Twilight
I’m loving this twilight
I’m loving this twi-lalalala lalalala twilight

Baby, I’ve known you for a long long time
I never thought that we would find
What we’re holding in our hands
Lately, I’ve been thinking I should make you mine
Been thinking that we should define
What we are, what we are, oh oh

And you know I love to be in control
But recently I don’t know what to do
I’m losing it over you, oh

Ooh la, ooh la
When you say my name
I can feel the flame getting stronger
Oh, let me hear you say
Ooh la, ooh la
We both feel the same
And I can’t play this game any longer

Oh boy
I’m loving this twilight
I’m loving this twilight
I’m loving this twi-lalalala lalalala twilight

Closer
I love it when you lean in close
You touch my heart like you don’t know
And I’ma show you, yeah I’ma show you now

And you know I love to be in control
But recently I don’t know what to do
I’m losing it over you

Ooh la, ooh la
When you say my name
I can feel the flame getting stronger
Oh, let me hear you say
Ooh la, ooh la
We both feel the same
And I can’t play this game any longer

Oh boy
I’m loving this twilight
I’m loving this twilight
I’m loving this twi-lalalala lalalala twilight

Yeah girl, I think about you all of the time
I love your smile and the way that you shine
Wondering how I’m going to make you mine
When it turns to night, I will make it right
So many things I’ve been waiting to say
Held in my heart for a day like today
I wanna hold you till the light fades away
I wanna hold you till the light fades away

Ooh la, ooh la
When you say my name
I can feel the flame getting stronger
Oh, let me hear you say
Ooh la, ooh la
We both feel the same
And I can’t play this game any longer

Oh boy
I’m loving this twilight
I’m loving this twilight
I’m loving this twi-lalalala lalalala twilight
I’m loving this twilight
I’m loving this twilight
I’m loving this twi-lalalala lalalala twilight
