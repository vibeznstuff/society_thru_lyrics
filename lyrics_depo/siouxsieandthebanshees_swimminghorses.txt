Falling in your, falling in your in your arms
Fish on a line, learns to live on dry land
Thrown back again to drown

Kinder with poison
Then pushed down the well or a face burnt to hell
Feel the cruel stones breaking her bones
Dead before born
Words fall in ruins -- but no sound
She's dying of your shame -- she's maimed by your pain
He gives birth to swimming horses

Fish on a line, walking on dry land
But back in the water to drown -- we drown
Floating in sky
He gives birth to swimming horses

Take a ride on the tide with the assassin at your side
the weightlessness under water -- forgets in slow motion
And watches pointless tortures
He gives birth to swimming horses
Floating in sky like fishes can fly through your arms
