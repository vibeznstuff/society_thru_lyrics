It was in the winter of '79 when the band was at a low 
Then we met yer man that they called The Mouth at a party there on show 
He said "Why'd you carry on this way, I could never go to dat" 
But he had to learn he was just the same - One step forward two steps back 
Can you hear me now 
Oh do you believe in miracles - Just as only dreamers can 
Anything can work with a miracle 
Like a bloody minded man - Like a bloody minded man 
It was in the autumn of '84 going live through '85 
When he made the greatest show on earth to help a country to survive 
Can you hear me now, hear me now 
Oh do you believe in miracles - Just as only dreamers can 
Anything can work with a miracle 
Like a bloody minded man - Like a bloody minded man 
So your man determined, he found a course 
When the powers just couldn't cope 
Or did you ever think that old rock and roll 
Could give the world some kind of hope 
Can you hear me now, hear me now 
Oh do you believe in miracles just as only dreamers can 
Anything can work with a miracle 
Like a bloody minded man - Like a bloody minded man 
Oh do you believe in miracles when the dream has just begun 
Anything can work with a miracle, just like Irelands favourite son 
And the dream has just begun 
Do you believe in miracles - Repeat to fade
