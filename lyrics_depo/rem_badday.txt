A Public service announcement followed me home the other day 
I paid it nevermind. Go away. 
Shits so thick you could stir it with a stick- free Teflon whitewashed presidency 
We're sick of being jerked around 
Wear that on your sleeve 

Broadcast me a joyful noise unto the times, lord, 
Count your blessings. 
We're sick of being jerked around 
We all fall down. 

Have you ever seen the televised St. vitus subcommittee prize 
Investigation dance? Those-ants-in- pants glances. 
Well, look behind the eyes 
It's a hallowed, hollow anesthesized 
"save my own ass, screw these guys" 
smoke and mirror lock down 

Broadcast me a joyful noise unto the times, lord, 
Count your blessings. 
the papers wouldn't lie! 
I sigh. Not one more 

Its been a bad day. 
Please dont take a picture 
Its been a bad day. 
Please 

We're dug in the deep the price is steep. 
The auctioneer is such a creep. 
The lights went out, the oil ran dry 
We blamed it on the other guy 
Sure, all men are created equal. 
Heres the church, heres the steeple 
Please stay tuned--we cut to sequel 
ashes, ashes, we all fall down. 

Broadcast me a joyful noise unto the times, lord, Count your blessings. 
Ebrace the lowest fear/Ignore the lower fears 
Ugh, this means war. 

Its been a bad day. 
Br. 

Broadcast me a joyful noise unto the times, lord, 
Count your blessings. 
We're sick of being jerked around 
We all fall down. 

Its been a bad day... 
Pleaase...
