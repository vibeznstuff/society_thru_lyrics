Move in circles at night,
You've given up the fight
Like the streets that you're always walking on...
You died inside,
And you don't know why
So you try to turn the light on...

But stand up and never say never
'Cause this life is gonna get better
Take a breath, shake it off and say
I'm on my way

You been down and feel so fed up
When they tell you, you might not get up
Might not be on top of the world but hey
Here's what you say

You might work but I work harder
You might fight but I fight smarter
Might not be on the top of the world but hey
I'm on my way
You might fly but I fly higher
You're so hot but I'm on fire
Might not be on top of the world but hey
I'm on my way ay
I'm on my way ay
I'm on my way ay
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
All alone in your bed
You tried when you said
What you said
Yeah you poured your heart out
But nothing's changed
Still a picture in a frame
And you try but you just can't break out, no

But stand up and never say never
'Cause this life is gonna get better
Take a breath, shake it off and say
I'm on my way

You been down and feel so fed up
When they tell you, you might not get up
Might not be on top of the world but hey
Here's what you say

You might work but I work harder
You might fight but I fight smarter
Might not be on the top of the world but hey
I'm on my way
You might fly but I fly higher
You're so hot but I'm on fire
Might not be on top of the world but hey
I'm on my way ay
I'm on my way ay
I'm on my way ay
I'm on my way

I'm on my way ay
I'm on my way ay
I'm on my way ay
I'm on my way

So stand up and never say never
'Cause this life is gonna get better
Take a breath, shake it off and say
I'm on my way

You might work but I work harder
You might fight but I fight smarter
Might not be on the top of the world but hey
I'm on my way
You might fly but I fly higher
You're so hot but I'm on fire
Might not be on top of the world but hey
I'm on my way ay
I'm on my way ay
I'm on my way ay
I'm on my way ay
I'm on my way ay
I'm on my way ay
I'm on my way ay
I'm on my way
I'm on my way...
