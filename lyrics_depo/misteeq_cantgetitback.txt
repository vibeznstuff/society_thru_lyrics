You can’t get it back 
You can’t get it back
You can’t can’t get get it it back back
You can’t can’t get get it it back back

Verse one, when we begun 
You know you had a sister all sprung
With your tongue 
I thought you were my baby no
When you were late you always knew the right words to say.
You got engaged to be married the very next May 


As the time moved on
The love we had got torn
You used to love me from dusk to dawn
And a trip of the night till mourn 
Know you wanna change
I’m sick of you playin’ these games
I’m telling you one thing
You won’t get back
You won’t get back 
This ring
I gave my love 
And I can’t get it back
gave you my time
And I can’t it back
Now the ring that you gave me 
You can’t get it back
Cause it’s just not going down like that
I gave you my time and
I can’t get it back
Gave you all my love and 
I can’t get it back
Now the rings that you gave me
You want them back
But its just not going down like that

You can’t can’t get get it it back back
You can’t can’t get get it it back back

Verse two now were through
Too much times been wasted on you
But its cool with a glass shoe on another young fool
I accept that your friend
And couldn’t take the heat so you stepped
Now I said don’t come back with nothing 
Cause you’ve left

As the time moved on
The love we had got torn
You used to love me from dusk to dawn
And a trip of the night till mourn 
Know you wanna change
I’m sick of you playin’ these games
I’m telling you one thing
You won’t get it back
You won’t get back 
This ring
I gave my love 
And I can’t get it back
gave you my time
And I can’t it back
Now the ring that you gave me 
You can’t get it back
Cause it’s just not going down like that
I gave you my time and
I can’t get it back
Gave you all my love and 
I can’t get it back
Now the rings that you gave me
You want them back
But its just not going down like that
Boy let me tell you this
Don’t you now 
You can’t get back what you put in this relationship
That includes this ring cause I now that 
I can’t get back (all my kiss my huggin and lovin) 

Shake it
We had a happy environment 
I put all this time
I gave you my all and
Even met your requirements
Now your going and cheating
Coming and smiling you can say what u want
Cause you ain’t getting this diamond
Ha 
You tip toe
Just keep you zip closed
But you can take me for a ride
But if you knock on my door
Were gonna collide 

I gave my love 
And I can’t get it back
Gave you my time
And I can’t it back
Now the ring that you gave me 
You can’t get it back
Cause it’s just not going down like that
Hey 
I gave you my time and
I can’t get it back
Gave you all my love and 
I can’t get it back
Now the rings that you gave me
You want them back
But its just not going down like that
