I don't know what to do
I don't know where to go
I am so close to you
And so out of control
I dont know how to help
There's nothing I can say
From heaven down to hell
Is a short way

And if I could let go of the hope, then maybe
I could settle for just being with you baby

Every night I lay me down
Fold my hands and close my eyes
Every night I pray for time
One more moment, one more try
I, I, I want you to come back
Oh lay down here in my arms
I'd light up every dark on your way
Baby all of your pain you can lay it on me
Yeah
You can lay it on me
Yeah

It's been so very long
But you're still here with me
And though I'm so alone
I'm thankful everyday
You're trying all the time
I know how bad it hurts
But we are on the line
That cannot let us burn

And if someone out there is a cure for this shit
I'd give my all to get to it

Every night I lay me down
Fold my hands and close my eyes
Every night I pray for time
One more moment, one more try
I, I, I want you to come back
Oh lay down here in my arms
I'd light up every dark on your way
Baby all of your pain you can lay it on me

(You know you can lay it on me)
You can lay it on me
(You know you can lay it on me)
(You know you can lay it on me)
One more moment, one more try

I, I, I want you to come back
Oh lay down here in my arms
I'd light up every dark on your way
Baby all of your pain you can lay it on me

(You know you can lay it on me)
You can lay it on me
(You know you can lay it on me)
Yeah
(You know you can lay it on me)
You can lay it on me
(You know you can lay it on me)
