I looked into my baby's eyes, I tried so hard to find some light
When I looked there was no one there, no one there at all
I walked on down a crowded street, I hard somebody talk to me
When I turned around to speak there was no one there at all

Can't go back, I can't go back, can't go back, I can't go back
Can't go back, I can't go back to the place I was before
Can't go back, I can't go back, can't go back, I can't go back
Can't go back, I can't go back to the place I was before

I stuck a needle in my arm, I stuck it in my baby's heart
She looked so hot and sexy, she wasn't there at all
I heard some one break in my house, they had a gun they had a knife
But it was all behind my eyes, there was no one there at all

Can't go back, I can't go back, can't go back, I can't go back
Can't go back, I can't go back to the place I was before
Can't go back, I can't go back, can't go back, I can't go back
Can't go back, I can't go back to the place I was before, let's go

My baby looked into my eyes, she tried so hard to find some light
When she looked there was no one there, no one there at all

Can't go back, I can't go back, can't go back, I can't go back
Can't go back, I can't go back to the place I was before
Can't go back, I can't go back, can't go back, I can't go back
Can't go back, I can't go back to the place I was before
