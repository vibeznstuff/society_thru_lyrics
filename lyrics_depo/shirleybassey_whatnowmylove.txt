What now my love
Now that you've left me
How can I live through another day?
Watching my dreams turn into ashes
And my hopes in to bits of clay

Once I could see
Once I could feel
Now I am none
I become unreal
I walk the night without a goal
Stripped of my heart, my soul

What now my love
Now that it's over?
I feel the world closing in on me
Here comes the stars' tumbling around me
There is the sky where the sea should be.

What now my love
Now that you're gone?
I'd be a fool to gone on and on
No one would care
No one would cry
If I should live
Or die.

What now my love
Now there is nothing?
Only my last goodbye.
