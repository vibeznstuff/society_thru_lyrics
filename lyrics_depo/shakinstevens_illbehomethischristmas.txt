I'll be home this christmas
This time for sure
To have and I'll hold you baby
Hold you in my arms

I'll be home this christmas
This time for sure
I'll be there to comfort you
Hold you for ever more

Lovin' you so tenderly
Oh just you wait and see
My heart will be for ever more
Yours till eternity

I'll be home this christmas
For sure this time
You're everything I dreaming of
I'll be home this christmas time

I'll be home this christmas
This time for sure
To have and hold you baby
Forever this christmas time

You're everything I dreaming of
I'll be home this christmas time
Forever this christmas time
I'll be home this christmas time
