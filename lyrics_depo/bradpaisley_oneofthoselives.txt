Rush hour traffic,
Always puts me in a bad mood.
I got chewed out by the boss today,
And now I'm stuck on highway 92.

Then you call me on my cell phone,
While I'm cussin' out a Cadillac.   
You say remember Tom and Jenny's little boy?
Well, the doctors say the cancer's back.

Man its been one of those days,
When I been thinking poor me.
I got no right to complain I guess,
Cause right now all I can see.

Is a little angel in a Yankees cap,
It makes me realize.
It's just been one those days for me,
But for him it's been one of those lives.

Everybody under my roof,
Is healthy- knock on wood.
Oh but I sure do sweat the small stuff, 
I don't thank God as much as I should.

Tonight I'm thinking about Tommy and Jenny,
And how they spent the last four years.
All those extended stays in Memphis,
All the sleepless nights, the prayers, the tears.

It's just been one of those days,
Where I was thinking poor me.
I got no right to complain I guess,
Cause right now all I can see.

Is that family moving back to Target House,
It makes me realize.
It's just been one those days for me,
But for them its been one of those lives.

And so it's been one of those days,
I let things get to me.
I got no right to complain,
Cause when I look around I see.

Folks that are fightin' for every breath,
And it makes me realize.
It's just been one for those days for me,
But for them it's been one of those lives.
