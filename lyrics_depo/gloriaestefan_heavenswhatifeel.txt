Love sometimes
Can be like destiny
There's no way to say forever
It may not realize your dreams
And love sometimes
Is like the blowing wind
It can take us to wherever
Sending us on silent wings

But I have broken
All the rules of love
I never dreamed that I could
Come this far
And now I'm lost in my emotions
You're becoming my devotion
There's nothing I can do
To stop this love for you

I was not supposed to fall in love with you
I have someone else
And someone else is loving you
And I was not supposed to let this love get through
So let me say for real
Heaven's what I feel when I'm with you
This feeling is forever
You make me feel like heaven
My love is true when I'm with you

How could I
Have known that in your eyes
I would find the deepest answers
To the questions of my heart
And how could I have known
That by your side
Was the light to fill the darkness
In the shadows of my life

But I have broken
All the rules of love
I never dreamed that I could
Come this far
And now I'm lost in my emotions
You're becoming my devotion
There's nothing I can do
To stop this love for you

I was not supposed to fall in love with you
I have someone else
And someone else is loving you
And I was not supposed to let this love get through
So let me say for real
Heaven's what I feel when I'm with you
This feeling is forever
You make me feel like heaven
My love is true when I'm with you

Heaven, heaven
Is what I feel when we're together
Heaven, heaven
Just look in my eyes and you'll see it's the truth
I was not supposed to fall in love with you
I have someone else
And someone else is loving you

And I was not supposed to let this love get through
So let me say for real
Heaven's what I feel
And I was not supposed to let this love get through
So let me say for real
Heaven's what I feel when I'm with you
