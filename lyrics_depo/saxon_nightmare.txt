(Where were you in the night)
(Where were you in the night)

As the night closes in I lay in my bed
Since you went away it's been driving me mad
I stand in my room I can't the light
I wish you were here I'm lonely at night

I'm caught in a nightmare
Alone in the night
(Where were you) I was caught in a nightmare
(Where were you) Alone in the night
(Where were you) I was caught in a nightmare
(Where were you) Alone in the night

I was caught on the inside I'm afraid of the night
That my nightmare begin where reality ends
I won't sleep tonight my head's spinning 'round
I'm alone in a crowd I wait for the dark
For my nightmare to start I'm lonely at night
Don't leave me this way

I'm caught in a nightmare
Alone in the night
(Where were you) I was caught in a nightmare
(Where were you) I was alone in the night
(Where were you) I was caught in a nightmare
(Where were you) Alone in the night

(Where were you) I was caught in a nightmare
(Where were you) Alone in the night
(Where were you) Here where you found me
(Where were you) Alone in the night

(Don't walk away) Don't leave me this way
(Don't leave me this way) Don't walk away
(Where were you in the night) Alone in the night
(Where were you) Don't leave me, no
(In the night) Don't walk away
(Where were you in the night)
