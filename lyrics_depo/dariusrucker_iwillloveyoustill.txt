Take the key off the chain
Leave it stuck in the door
Don't even try to explain
What you're leaving me for
Cause you won't cry
And you won't call
And you won't even miss me at all

But I will
(In the middle of the night, in the middle of the day)
Yeah I will
(Every second you're gone, once you go away)
I will love you still

Take those pictures of us
Pull 'em down off the shelf
Go wherever you want
Go, try to be somebody else
'Cause you won't stay
And you won't fight
And you won't wonder
Where I'm sleeping tonight

But I will
(In the middle of the night, in the middle of the day)
Yeah, I will
(Every second you're gone, once you go away)
You know I will love you still

I hope you never spend forever
Wondering if he ever
Wondering if he ever
Wondering if you ever loved me at all

I will
(In the middle of the night, in the middle of the day)
Oh, I will
(Every second you're gone, once you go away)
You know I will love you still
Oh I know, I know that I will love you still
I will love you still
