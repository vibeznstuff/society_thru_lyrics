The days
Are ghosts that pass right through us
In my eyes
You're like an evergreen
Untouched
By the hours that fly around us
My love
Is that how you see me?

Remember when
Remember when we were the diamonds in the coal
Lovers know
There's no age upon your soul

It's all okay, you give me young blood
It's coursing through my veins, it's real love
Here inside my heart it's crystallised
Like it's framed in time and never tainted

Yeah, it's alright, you give me young blood
Before the world I may be old enough
There'll be a day to take the best of us
But till then we have young blood

Somehow
I never saw it coming
I'm caught
And it has set me free

Remember when
Remember when we used to talk of growing old
Lovers know
There's no age upon your soul

Yeah, it's okay, you give me young blood
It's coursing through my veins, it's real love
Here inside my heart it's crystallised
Like it's framed in time and never tainted

Yeah, it's alright, you give me young blood
Before the world I may be old enough
There'll be a day to take the best of us
But till then we have young blood

Oh...

On and on you give me young blood
It's coursing through my veins, it's real love
And here inside my heart it's crystallised
Just like it's framed in time and never tainted

Yeah, it's alright, you give me young blood
Before the world I may be old enough
There'll be a day to take the best of us

But till then we have young blood
