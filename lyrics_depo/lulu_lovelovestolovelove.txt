Some people live within the world
And some people live without it (hey)
Some people got to whisper their love
And some people, they gotta shout it (hey)
One thing they have in common is
They all talk a lot about it
Everybody wants it or has it or holds it
But as for me, I doubt it

Love loves to love love to love love to love (love)
Love loves to love love to love love to love (love)

The tiger in the zoo loves the other tiger, too
And the keeper loves a lady who is dead
He's matched to the king, loves
Who's matched to the queen of blues hung up on red (tight)
You love someone who loves someone else
In your heart, it feels like lead
Everyone wants someone
But the universe loves everyone, that's why I said

Love loves to love love to love love to love (love)
Love loves to love love to love love to love (love)

It really doesn't matter what the guys like
If he's a give or taker or a user
Everyone wins or loses at love
But love is never the loser
All you gotta do is whisper the words
And everybody understands you
Love is an excuse for having extra tears
That anything you'll do will hand you

Love loves to love love to love love to love (love)
Love loves to love love to love love to love (love)
