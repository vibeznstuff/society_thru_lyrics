I harbor thoughts of killing you 
Pour petrol on you and then on me 
But then I walk down the stairs 
And killing joke waits for me there 
Then we play - go psycho 

With sticks and stones and bones beneath our homes we face ourselves 
Hosannas rising from the basements of hell 

Anger that poisons my heart 
Eating your liver and heart 
Like voodoo just play until you bleed 
Lost in the noise I am free 
I'm not a murderer yet 
I'm not a murderer yet 

With sticks and stones and bones beneath our homes we face ourselves 
Hosannas rising from the basements of hell 

I'm not a murderer yet 
I'm not a murderer yet 
I'm not a murderer yet 
I'm not a murderer yet
