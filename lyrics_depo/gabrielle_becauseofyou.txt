Touching the heart of me
That's what you do baby, can't you see?
Right now you've got me falling
I'm falling, there's no stopping no, no
Touching the heart of me

You can paint a picture using words
You can make me feel I top the world
When you're near I'm never feeling blue
'Cause you always know just what to do, to do
Touching the heart of me

Baby it's because of you
That I do the things I do
Every time we touch it means so much
And it's all because of you
Baby it's because of you
That I do the things I do
Every time you're near I have no fear
And it's all because of you

Because you're the best thing in my life
When I'm with you it feels so right
Oh, how I miss you when you're gone
Although you're never gone for long, long
You're touching the heart of me

You know just how to cherish me
You know exactly how I feel
With you I'm always feeling fine
So fine, you know you blow my mind, my mind
You're touching the heart of me

Baby it's because of you
That I do the things I do
Every time we touch it means so much
And it's all because of you
Baby it's because of you
That I do the things I do
Every time you're near I have no fear
And it's all because of you, because of you

Should you ever feel the need wanna fly away
I will fight to change your mind
I'll try to make you stay

Touching the heart of me
That's what you do baby, can't you see?
Right now you've got me falling
I'm falling, there's no stopping no, no
You're touching the heart of me

Baby it's because of you
That I do the things I do
Every time we touch it means so much
And it's all because of you
Baby it's because of you
That I do the things I do
Every time you're near I have no fear
And it's all because of you

Baby it's because of you
That I do the things I do
Every time we touch it means so much
And it's all because of you
Baby it's because of you
That I do the things I do
Every time you're near I have no fear
And it's all because of you

Baby it's because of you
That I do the things I do
Every time we touch it means so much
And it's all because of you
Baby it's because of you
That I do the things I do
Every time you're near I have no fear
And it's all because of you
