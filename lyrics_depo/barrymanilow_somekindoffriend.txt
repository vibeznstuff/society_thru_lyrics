I saw you at the Beechwood Cafe
You looked at me and then you looked away
That was some kind
Some kind of friend you turned out to be
You said you had places you had to be
Now who is gonna be there for me

That was some kind
Some kind of friend you turned out to be
Lady that was some kind
Some kind of friend you turned out to be
Baby that was some kind
Some kind of friend you turned out to be

They say that women like you can't get enough
Got our Maserati built for two
They say that women like you like to play
With love
Is that true?
When I ran into you the other day
You smiled at me but you had nothing to say
That was some kind
Some kind of friend you turned out to be
Tell me why'd you do what you did to me
Covered up in your life so I couldn't see

Now that was some kind
Some kind of friend you turned out to be
Lady that was some kind
Some kind of friend you turned out to be
Baby that was some kind
Some kind of friend you turned out to be

I never should have let you get to me
Never should have let you bring me down
Didn't know that I was just some fantasy
That you found.

Some kind
Some kind of friend
Some kind
Some kind
Some kind of friend
Some kind
Some kind
Some kind of friend
Some kind
Some kind
Some kind of friend
Some kind
Lady that was some kind
Some kind of friend you turned out to be
Baby that was some kind
Some kind of friend you turned out to be
Some kind of friend
