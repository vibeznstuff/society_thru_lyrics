You made me cry
when you said, "goodbye"

Ain't that a shame?
my tears fell like rain.
Ain't that a shame?
you're the one to blame.

You broke my heart
when you said we'll part

Ain't that a shame?
my tears fell like rain.
Ain't that a shame?
you're the one to blame

Oh well, goodbye
although I'll cry.

Ain't that a shame...
