For too long now, there were secrets in my mind
For too long now, there were things I should have said
In the darkness, I was stumbling for the door
To find a reason, to find the time, the place, the hour
Waiting for the winter sun and the cold light of day

The misty ghosts of childhood fears
The pressure is building and I can't stay away.

I throw myself into the sea
Release the wave
Let it wash over me
To face the fear I once believed
The tears of the dragon for you and for me

Where I was, I had wings that couldn't fly
Where I was, I had tears I couldn't cry
My emotions, frozen in an iced lake
I couldn't feel them until the ice began to break
I have no power over this, you know I'm afraid
The walls I built are crumbling, the water is moving,
I'm slipping away...

I throw myself into the sea
Release the wave, let it wash over me
To face the fear I once believed
The tears of the dragon for you and for me

Slowly I awake, slowly I rise
The walls I built are crumbling,
The water is moving,
I'm slipping away.

I throw myself into the sea
Release the wave, let it wash over me
To face the fear I once believed
The tears of the dragon for you and for me

I throw myself into the sea
Release the wave, let it wash over me
To face the fear I once believed
The tears of the dragon for you and for me
