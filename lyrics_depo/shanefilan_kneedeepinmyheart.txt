Life is running past me
Days and hours too
Like it had no color
Just different shades of blue
I heard about this love thing
But I still needed proof
'Cause I believed in nothing
'Til I believed in you

And I say..
Wooohhh..
You left your fingerprints
All over my soul


And I caught you out red handed
Knee deep in my heart
When I was upside down
Spinning round and round and round in the dark
Act so sweet but you're guilty as charged
I caught you out red handed
Knee deep in my heart

I never saw it coming
You took me by surprise
'Cause you ain't done the cover
Without an alibi
You done the perfect crime girl
Now I wanna do the time
'Cause I got no defense but hell
I'm gonna walk the line

And I say..
Wooohhh..
You left your fingerprints
All over my soul


And I caught you out red handed
Knee deep in my heart
When I was upside down
Spinning round and round and round in the dark
Act so sweet but you're guilty as charged
I caught you out red handed
Knee deep in my heart

Not the day the sweetest freedom
Not by what I believe in

Wooohhh..

And I say..
Wooohhh..
You left your fingerprints
All over my soul..
My soul..


And I caught you out red handed
Knee deep in my heart
When I was upside down
Spinning round and round and round
And I caught you out red handed
Knee deep in my heart
When I was upside down
Spinning round and round and round in the dark
Act so sweet but you're guilty as charged
I caught you out red handed
Knee deep in my heart

Woooohh..
