When I met you woman
I couldn't help but notice a face so beautiful
Now imagine, the faces you'd make if we ever made love

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Pulled up in the drop top Benz  
Hit the horn two times and you walked outside (mmmhmm)
Dress keep hugging them thighs 
And the only thing inside my mind is (mmmhmmm)
I want you 
Yes I do, and if there's anything you suggest I do
Then tell me

Now we all in the crib on my sofa
Girl I'm so glad you came over
I wanna tell you 'come closer'
But I don't know if you feel, like I feel
Tell me girl

Don't it feel good when I touch on it
Wouldn't it be nice if all night I was in you
Come kiss me, come with me
Down the hall to my bedroom
Tonight we'll be

Making love faces, making love faces
Shadows on the wall while the candles burnin'
Messin' up the bed while you sweatin' out your perm and
Making love faces, making love faces
My hands rubbin' on your skin
Let's go hard don't hold it in

Girl let me wrap my hands around you (hands around you, hands around you)
So happy every since I found you
Just like a kid who found some candy
Let me feel and find your panties

Take 'em off take em off take em off
Take 'em off please
Oh down on my knees
Ohh, You're right in front of me
Don't have to pay for my attention
Can you hear me is you listenin?
Baby be real with me
I wanna know

Don't it feel good when I touch on it
Wouldn't it be nice if all night I was in you
Come kiss me, come with me
Down the hall to my bedroom
Tonight we'll be

Making love faces, making love faces
Shadows on the wall while the candles burnin'
Messin' up the bed while you sweatin' out your perm and
Making love faces, making love faces
My hands rubbin' on your skin
Let's go hard don't hold it in

The way you bite your lip
Is that your way of tellin' me you like it?
Mmhmm, if I'm the best you ever had girl in your life
Say mmhmm, and when your eyes roll back in your head
Shakin' your legs
Mmhmm, mmhmm, that's what she said

Making love faces, making love faces
Shadows on the wall while the candles burnin'
Messin' up the bed while you sweatin' out your perm and
Making love faces, making love faces
My hands rubbin' on your skin
Let's go hard don't hold it in, love faces
