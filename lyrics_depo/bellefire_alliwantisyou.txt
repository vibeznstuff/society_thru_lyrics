You say you want
A diamond on a ring of gold
You say you want
Your story to remain ontold


But all the promises that we made
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you


You say you'll give me
A highway with no one on it
Treasure just to look upon it
All the riches in the night


You say you'll give me
Eyes on a moon of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbour in the tempest


But all the promises that we made
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you


You say you want
Your love to work out right
To last with me through the night


You say you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
And your love not to grow cold


But all the promises that we made
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you


All I want, all I want is you...
