I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger
I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger

I look like a little girl
Living in a big man's world
But the ribbons that you see 
Hide the real me
Loves I've left behind 
Might make you think and change your mind

I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger
I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger

A lot of men have come my way
Thinking that I'm easy prey
But you'll never tame this child
She loves running wild
You won't cage me in, 
Just stick around, see the fun begin

I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger
I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger

A lot of men have come my way
Thinking that I'm easy prey
But you'll never tame this child
She loves running wild
You won't cage me in
Just stick around, see the fun begin

I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger
I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger
I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger
