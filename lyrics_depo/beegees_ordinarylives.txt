There'll be one small light
all over the world tonight.
The search go on for the one,
it was love with no name
and we glowed in the sun.
There was one small dream
incredible highs and lows,
what little we knew living ordinary lives.
Made a dream for you, living ordinary lives.


Ordinary people living ordinary lives.
Ordinary people living ordinary lives.

We were be one small light
all over the world tonight.
The search go on for the one,
it was love with no name
and we glowed in the sun.
There was one small dream
incredible highs and lows,
what little we knew living ordinary lives.
Made a dream for you, living ordinary lives.

We were ordinary people living ordinary lives.
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives.


The clock on the wall keeps moving,
time stands still,
no matter how the dice may fall,
someone else always gets to call the number.

Say goodbye cruel world
No pity no pain tonight
Whatever the cost all is lost
If this is love with no name
Then it's all in the stars
Whether it's wrong or right
There's no one to blame no lies
What else could we do
Living ordinary lives
Made a dream for you
Living ordinary lives.
