Mr Cab Driver won't you stop to let me in 
Mr Cab Driver don't like my kind of skin 
Mr Cab Driver you're never gonna win 
Mr Cab Driver won't you stop to pick me up 
Mr Cab Driver I might need some help 
Mr Cab Driver only thinks about himself 
Here we go 

Mr Cab Driver, Mr Cab Driver 
Mr Cab Driver, Mr Cab Driver 

Mr Cab Driver don't like the way I look 
He don't like dreads he thinks we're all crooks 
Mr Cab Driver reads too many story books 
Mr Cab Driver pass me up with eyes of fire 
Mr Cab Driver thinks we're all one sixty five'ers 
Mr Cab Driver fuck you I'm a survivor 
Oh yeah, one more time, ahah 

Let me in 

Mr Cab Driver, Mr Cab Driver 
Mr Cab Driver, Mr Cab Driver
