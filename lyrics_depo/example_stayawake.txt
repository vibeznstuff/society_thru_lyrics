If we don't
If we don't
If we don't
If we don't
If we don't
If we don't
If we don't
If we don't
If we don't

If we don't kill ourselves we'll be the leaders of a messed-up generation
If we don't kid ourselves will they believe us if we tell them the reasons why
Do we take it too far, take it too far?
Did we chase the rabbit into wonderland?
Lose a hundred grand,
Will they understand
It was all to stay awake for the longest

March on, always after us
Lost troops, half the class of us
You man ain't seen the last of us
Stick around yeah like Elastoplast
Not half mast,
Raise the flag, kick the sand
To let you know that we're coming
And we're nasty men

Don't need sleeping beauty
No, it's what you did to me
Come midnight and daybreak
Yes please go find me a name sake
We got faith, but don't need bibles
Take the michael,
Hear my recital
While I hold the title
Quite vital
We get high on the opposite of Nytol

It was all to stay awake for the longest time
It was long, it was wrong
But it felt so right
See you at the finish line
See you at the finish line
If you got the heart to join us

If we don't kill ourselves we'll be the leaders of a messed-up generation
If we don't kid ourselves will they believe us if we tell them the reasons why
Do we take it too far, take it too far?
Did we chase the rabbit into wonderland?
Lose a hundred grand
Will they understand
It was all to stay awake for the longest

March on, always after us
Lost troops, half the class of us
You might not see the last of us
Stick around yeah like Elastoplast
Not half mast,
Raise the flag, kick the sand
To let them know that we're coming
And we're nasty men

Don't need sleeping beauty
No, it's what you did to me
Come midnight and daybreak
Yes please go find me a name sake
We got faith, but don't need bibles
Take the Michael,
Hear my recital
While I hold the title
Quite vital
We get high on the opposite of Nytol

We just grow, if it's late
Then we'll show, we don't wait
We just grow, if you hate
We don't show, we don't wait
We just grow, if it's late
Then we'll show, we don't wait
We just grow

If we don't...

If we don't kill ourselves we'll be the leaders of a messed-up generation
If we don't kid ourselves will they believe us if we tell them the reasons why
Do we take it too far, take it too far?
Did we chase the rabbit into wonderland?
Lose a hundred grand,
Will they understand
It was all to stay awake for the longest
