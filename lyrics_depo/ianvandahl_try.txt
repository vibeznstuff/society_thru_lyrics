Don't try to run away...
'cause I understand what you're feeling.
Don't try to run away...
'cause I understand the pain that's tearing you apart.

Just stay here with me.
So you will see...
that you belong to me.
We will be free


Give your heart.
Feel like a bird in the sky.
Flying on the wings of love.
Come into my open arms.

Don't try to run away...
'cause I understand what you're feeling.
Don't try to run away...

Give your heart.

Flying on the wings of love.
Come into my open arms.

Don't try to run away...
