A one way love can hang you up awful bad
And before I met you that's the only kind of love I had
So I just can't take your word
That things are gonna work out fine
You got to show me girl
Show me that you're really mine

If you're any better than the other girls I've known
You'll never prove it to me by words alone
So right from the very start
I'm laying it on the line
You got to show me girl
Show me that you're really mine

You got to show me you understand
When things don't go the way we planned
You got to show me you'll be true
Show me I'll be able to count on you

Oh I'd love to love you
You know I think you're out of sight
But first I've got to be sure you're gonna treat me right
If you really care, and you're not just wasting my time
Come on and show me girl
Show me that you're really mine

So if you really care
And you're not just wasting my time
Come on and show me girl
Show me that you're really mine
You got to show me girl
Show me that you're really mine
Come on and show me girl
Show me that you're really mine
