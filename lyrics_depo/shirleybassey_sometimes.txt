Sometimes, not often enough
We reflect upon the good things
And those thoughts always
center around those we love
And I think about those people
Who mean so much to me
And for so many years have made me
So very happy

And I count the times I have forgotten to say
Thank you
And just how much I love them

And I think about those people
Who mean so much to me
And for so many years have made me
So very happy

And I count the times I have forgotten to say
Thank you
And just how much I love them

And I think about those people
Who mean so much to me
And for so many years have made me
So very happy

And I count the times I have forgotten to say
Thank you
And just how much I love them
And just how much I need them
And just how much I love them
