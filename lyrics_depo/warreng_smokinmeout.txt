If you wanna be with me, yeah, let me hear you say Warren G, Warren G
If you wanna be with me, well well well, let me hear you say Warren G,
Warren G


Smokin me out to the finish, I thought you knew,
I thought they knew, who was up in this,
Ron Isley, I's be Warren G,
Baby said would ya please come roll deep,
Chocolate Thai, I said I,
got the hennessey chaser, skirt you look fly
peepin them lips, hittin two finger sips,
on the 710 freeway, I straight dips
wit a fat one rolled up to puff
I'm ready to hit it and I won't quit it until I get enough
tokin nothing but the bomb thats without no doubt,
as she twist up another split she's straight smokin me out


She's smokin me out, smokin me out
smokin me out, smokin me out,
Oh she's smokin me out with the homey's love


I slinkin while I'm thinkin just how good it is,
to do it how we do it in the hood I live,
passin homies on the block, gettin major respect,
and by then y'all the hen dog is taken effect,
never panic hit Atlantic then I banked to right
pulled straight Nellin B's order steak and rice,
with the gravy, baby gets the shrimps and fries,
I'm diggin on her figure as I glimpse her thighs,
she's satisfied, I left the tip and dipped to get back
to twist another zag and to grab a six pack,
she went back, so we proceed to parlay,
everything is lovely and we doin it always



This ain't no love ballad,
but see baby I gots to have it,
when I see that bomb I grab it, cuz its a habit,
so dont come with that toe down stretch,
I ain't stressin, Long Beach baby keep smokin me out, she learned a lesson,
floatin high as a kite as I chill and lay low,
bumpin time is collected, sunday nights on the radio
oh, I forgot, how lit I was, crazy glued to the seat
dog said she need,
so conversation ain't needed,
when she know that I'm weeded,
headin to the hotel to regulate it and beat it
I exhaled, I seen a cloud of smoke,
I banged it to the boogie by my head and got locced
