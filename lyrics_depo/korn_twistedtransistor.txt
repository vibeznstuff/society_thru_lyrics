Hey you, hey you, Devil's little sister
Listening to your Twisted Transistor
Hold it between your legs
Turn it up, turn it up
Low end is coming through
Can't get enough

A lonely life, where no one understands you
But don't give up, because the music do
Music do 

Because the music do
And then it's reaching
Inside you forever preaching
Fuck you too
Your scream's a whisper
Hang on you
Twisted Transistor

Hey you, hey you, finally you get it
The world ain't fair, eat you if you let it
And as your tears fall on
Your breast, your dress
Vibrations coming through
You're in a mess

A lonely life, where no one understands you
But don't give up, because the music do
Music do 

Because the music do
And then it's reaching
Inside you forever preaching
Fuck you too
Your scream's a whisper
Hang on you
Twisted Transistor
Music do, Music do 

Hey you, hey you, this won't hurt a bit
This won't hurt a bit, this won't hurt
Says who? Says who?
Anesthetize this bitch
Anesthetize this bitch, anesthetize!
Just let me be
Between you and me don't fit

Because the music do
And then it's reaching
Inside you forever preaching
Fuck you too
Your scream's a whisper
Hang on you
Twisted Transistor
