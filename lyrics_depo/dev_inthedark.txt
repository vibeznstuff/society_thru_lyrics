On my waist, through my hair
Think about it when you touch me there
Close my eyes, here you are
All alone dancing in the dark

Tell me baby if it's wrong
To let my hands do what they want
Late at night I pretend we are
Dance, dance, da-dance dancing in the dark

Dancing in the dark, ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la dancing in the dark.

Put your work on me
Open my body up and do some surgery
Now that you got me up, I wanna taste it, taste it
And see those pocket aces

I wanna see who you are, I got a sex drive just push to start 
Push push push push to start
I got a sex drive just push to start.

On my waist, through my hair
Think about it when you touch me there
Close my eyes, here you are
Dance, dance, da-dance dancing in the dark

Ooh la la, Ooh la la, Ooh la la dancing in the dark
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la dancing in the dark.

I love to flirt to see, I'm only talking to you
If you wanna surf my seas, now that you got me boy
You know you better spice it flavour it
Get it get it right, savour it

I wanna see who you are, I got a sex drive just push to start 
Push push push push to start
I got a sex drive just push to start.

On my waist, through my hair
Think about it when you touch me there
Close my eyes, here you are
All alone dancing in the dark

Tell me baby if it's wrong
To let my hands do what they want
Late at night I pretend we are
Dance, dance, da-dance, dancing in the dark

Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la

Tell me baby if it's wrong (ooh la la, ooh la la)
Dancing in the dark (ooh la la)
To let my hands do what they want ooh la la, ooh la la)
Dancing in the dark

It's the Cataracs, ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la, dancing in the dark
Dancing in the dark ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la
