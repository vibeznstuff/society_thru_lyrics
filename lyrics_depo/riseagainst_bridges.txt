In a world of uncertainty
The night sky told us all to be patient
But when the ground started shaking
I wondered for how long?

But there's a place that I'd rather be
And there a voice deep inside of me
Saying the progress we are making
Is not progress at all

Into a world of promises, whoa
Is where we let ourselves be led

We built the bridges
We now sleep under
We framed the doorways
But may not pass through
The very same roads
That we now wander
The ones you pass us by on
We paved with our bare hands
Paved with our bare hands

A black cloud hovers over me
But without all this guilt I feel naked
Something about the way it
Wraps it's arms around

White snow covers everything
An angel watches over me praying
She asks me for a favor
"Catch me if I fall"
A rush of blood straight to the head
I wonder what this could have been

We built the bridges
We now sleep under
We framed the doorways
But may not pass through
The very same roads
That we now wander
The roads you pass us by on
We paved with our bare hands
Paved with our bare hands
Hey!

No I never meant to hurt you
No I never meant to do you wrong
I stood waiting but
A man said move along

We laid the tracks down
But now they've rotted
And like a runaway train
We brace for the crash
We were in love once
Have you forgotten?
And like a runaway train
Bearing down upon a gap

We built the bridges (brace for the crash)
(Built from their hypocrisy)
We built the bridges (brace for the crash)
(Built from their hypocrisy)
We built the bridges (brace for the crash)
(Built from their hypocrisy)
We built the bridges (brace for the crash)
And underneath their
Shadows we now live
