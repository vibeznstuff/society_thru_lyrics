Visions of you in shades of blue
Smoking, shifting, lazily drifting,
My darling, I miss you so.

Time goes by, no wonder my
Senses go reeling, your eyes so appealing
I see the whole night through.

When will we meet again? When? When? When?
When will we meet again? When? When? When?

I remember the days, beautiful days
Tenderly gleaming, my whole life seeming
To start and end with you.
