What ya doin' tonight 
I wish I could be 
A fly on your wall
Are u really alone
Whose stealin' your dreams
Why can't I breathe
You in to my life 
So tell me
What would it take 
To make you see that I'm alive


If I was invisible 
Then I could just watch you in your room
If I was invincible
I'd make you mine tonight 
If hearts were unbreakable 
Then I could just tell you where I stand
I would be the smartest man 
If I was invisible 
Wait, I already am 

Saw your face in the crowd
I call out your name 
You don't hear a sound
I keep tracing your steps 
Each move that you make 
Wish I could read 
What goes through your mind
Oh baby 
Wish I could touch me 
With the colours of your life



I am nothing without you 
Just a shadow passing through 
If I was invisible 
Then I could just watch you in your room 
If I was invincible
I'd make you mine to night
If hearts were unbreakable
Then I could just tell you where I stand 
I would be the smartest man 
If I was invisible
If I was invisible
If I was invisible
Wait, I already am
