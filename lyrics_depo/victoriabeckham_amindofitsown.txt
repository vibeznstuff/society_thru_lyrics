Stop, slow down, take a deep breath (ooh yeah)
Stop, slow down, take a deep breath (na na na na na)
Ooh, oh

I look at you and I know you're trouble
I should run just fast as I can
One smile, game over
Here in front of you I stand
I know you're only gonna burst my bubble
Trouble is my heart don't care
It's ignoring all the danger signs
Stop, Slow down, take a deep breath, beware

I'm not willing to be so fearless, careless, just yet
Once bitten, twice shy, is what you get

My hearts got a mind of it's own
Won't listen to a word I say
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way
Cos When it breaks I break 
I don't know how much more of this I can take
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way

Too many times I've witnessed
My heart make a fool of itself
So sure it's gonna turn out one way
Always turns out being somethin' else

My hearts got a real malfunction
Always flippin' into over ride
When I tell it to be sensible
It over rules my cynical mind

I'm not willing to be so open, transparent, no not yet
Once bitten twice shy, is what you get
(But here in front of you, there's nothin I can do)

My hearts got a mind of it's own
Won't listen to a word I say
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way
Cos When it breaks I break 
I don't know how much more of this I can take
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way

My hearts got a mind of it's own
Won't listen to a word I say (word I say)
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too (hurt too)
When it acts that way
Cos When it breaks I break 
I don't know how much more of this I can take
(I don't know how much more of this I can take)
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way

Stop, slow down, take a deep breath
Think about what I'm doin'
Think about once bitten, twice shy
Stop, slow down, take a second
Before you rush right in
It's gonna be my tears you cry

My hearts got a mind of it's own (of it's own)
Won't listen to a word I say
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way (when it acts that way)
Cos When it breaks I break (I break)
I don't know how much more of this I can take
(More of this I can take)
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too (get hurt too)
When it acts that way (when it acts that way)

My hearts got a mind of it's own (mind of it's own)
Won't listen to a word I say
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
(Doesn't it know that I get hurt too)
When it acts that way (when it acts that way)
Cos when it breaks I break (Cos when it breaks I break)
I don't know how much more of this I can take
(More of this I can take)
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way

My hearts got a mind of it's own
My hearts got a mind of it's own
Stop, slow down, take a deep breath
