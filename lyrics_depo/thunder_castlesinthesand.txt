There must have been a moment
A second or a time
When I didn't look up
Or I missed some kind of sign
Turned the wrong direction
When she was just an inch away
Like a missed connection
And my future slipped away

There's been times when I feel like I'm conspired against by fate
It's almost bad enough to make me hate

I'm sick of building castles in the sand
Waiting for another fake to break my promised land
I've been looking for the real thing in a lonely one night stand
Just building castles in the sand

Cos it terrifies me, ending up alone
And it walks beside me, the ghost of chances gone
Did I have it, did I let it go,
Or close the door to fast?
Is there an answer locked up in my past
In my past...

I'm sick of building castles in the sand
Waiting for another fake to break my promised land
I've been looking for the real thing in a lonely one night stand
Just building castles in the sand

I've been dying, I've been living alone so long
Going over and over the reasons, but I can't find a thing that's wrong
In my mind all the evidence seems to say
I wouldn't even know it if she walked right in today

I'm sick of building castles in the sand
Waiting for another fake to break my promised land
I've been looking for the real thing in a lonely one night stand
Just building castles in the sand
