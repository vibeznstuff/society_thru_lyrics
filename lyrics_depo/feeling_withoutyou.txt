Winters come and summers go
Last time round for all we know
Wonder what the time is in London

As they tear this world apart
Step by step it breaks my heart
Wonder what the time is in London

Well, I know I'm not the lonely child
Thirty dead and one teenage gun man
I wonder what the time is in London, without you

I get up early every morning without you
I open up the blind and let the dawn in without you
And then I think about growing older without you
And my blood runs a little colder without you

It's raining hard in North Virginia
Just like London town

Tales of screams from giant screens
Full of fear and full of beans
Wonder what the news is in London

Tell me what I've always known
Live is love and love's at home
Wonder if they miss me in London

These are the things that make us glad we're still alive
Even though your heart's in the dungeon
I wonder what the time is in London, without you

I get up early every morning without you
I open up the blind and let the dawn in without you
And then I think about growing older without you
And my blood runs a little colder without you

It's raining hard in North Virginia
Just like London town
It's raining hard in North Virginia
Just like London town

(Without you, without you)
It's raining hard in North Virginia
(Without you)
Just like London town, yeah
(Without you)

It's raining hard in North Virginia
(Without you)
Just like London town
(Without you)
