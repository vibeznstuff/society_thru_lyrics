Well, it's time to start the show,
Lost my heart and lost my soul.
Now it's the time that you won't know,
Lost my mind and lost my goal.

Mm, not giving in.
I'm not giving in,
Not giving in,
Ooh I'm not giving in, yeah.

This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in,
This time, I'm gonna be stronger, no, I'm not giving in.

Waste my time which makes things worse,
Lost in mine, my love is cursed.
Mm, time to make these things feel right,
Mmm, let's start this show for one last time.

Oh, I'm not giving in,
(Not giving in)
Not giving in,
(Not giving in)
Let me tell you no, not giving in,
Not this time,
(Not giving in)
Not gonna give it in.

This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in,
This time, I'm gonna be stronger, no, I'm not giving in.

Nooo, not giving in.
Not giving in
(This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in)

(This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in)

This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in,
This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in.
This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in,
This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in.
This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in,
