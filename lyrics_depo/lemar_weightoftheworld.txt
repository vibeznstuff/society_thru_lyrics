It's like chasing shadows
I never seem to win
Just when I'm over you
I feel myself falling again
No hope of grace
I'm losing faith
All I can do is pray


Can you hear me?
Can you hear me? Oh
Can you hear me?


It feels like the weight of the world
Have the angels turned their back on me?
It feels like the weight of the world
Can't let go of what we use to be
Oh, when all my cries
Have gone unheard
And I'm left on my knees
It feels like the weight of the world
Cause I still remember how it felt
When you loved me
When you loved me

I've got no road to follow
Left with no eyes to see
No love to barrow
Since you left
I can barrely breathe
In a lonely place
And it can't be changed
All I can do is pray






Love me again
Or set me free
Love me again, Oh
Love me again
Or set me free
