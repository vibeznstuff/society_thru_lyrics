If you think I could ever go a day without you
Five minutes without thinkin' about you
Don't
And if you wonder if it scares me
Thinkin' about forever with you, baby
I can tell you, baby, it don't, oh

'Cause every single mornin'
My eyes fall open on you
It's like my dreams keep goin'
On and on and on, it don't
Matter what we're doin'
As long as I'm with you, and
I can't imagine anything
I couldn't love you through the bad days
There's gonna be mistakes
But, baby, I'm here to stay
And if you think that could change
Don't

Stop makin' me late for work
Wakin' me up without sayin' a word
Ooh, don't
'Cause when you whisper in my ear
Everything I wanna hear
I know you know, I need to go
But you're the reason that I don't

'Cause every single mornin'
My eyes fall open on you
It's like my dreams keep goin'
On and on and on, it don't
Matter what we're doin'
As long as I'm with you, and
I can't imagine anything
I couldn't love you through the bad days
There's gonna be mistakes
But, baby, I'm here to stay
And if you think that could change
Don't
Oh, baby, don't

Oh, and if you ever wonder
If I regret the day I said, "I do"
Don't

'Cause every single mornin'
My eyes fall open on you
It's like my dreams keep goin'
On and on and on, it don't
Matter what we're doin'
As long as I'm with you, and
I can't imagine anything
I couldn't love you through the bad days
There's gonna be mistakes
But, baby, I'm here to stay
And if you think that could change
Don't

Baby, don't
Don't you think I don't
Oh, yeah, I know
Baby, don't
