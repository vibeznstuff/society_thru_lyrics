There's a certain sound
Always follows me around
When your close to me
You will hear it

It's the sound of lovers
Here when they discover
There could be no other for their love

It's my happy heart you hear
Singing loud and singing clear
And it's all because your near
Me my love
Take my happy heart away
Let me love you night and day
In your arms I want to stay, oh my love

Feeling more and more
Like I've never felt before
You have changed my life
So completely

Music fills my soul now
I've lost all control now
I'm not half, I'm whole now
With your love

It's my happy heart you hear
Singing loud and singing clear
And it's all because your near
Me my love
Take my happy heart away
Let me love you night and day
In your arms I want to stay, oh my love

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ...
