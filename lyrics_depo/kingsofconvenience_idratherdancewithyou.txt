I'd rather dance with you
than talk with you,
so why don't we just move into the other room.
There's space for us to shake,
and 'hey, I like this tune'.

Even if I could hear what you said,
I doubt my reply would be interesting
for you to hear.
Because I haven't read a single book all year,
and the only film I saw,
I didn't like it at all.

I'd rather dance than talk with you.
I'd rather dance than talk with you.
I'd rather dance than talk with you.

The music's too loud
and the noise from the crowd
increases the chance of misinterpretation.
So let your hips do the talking.
I'll make you laugh by acting like the guy who sings,
and you'll make me smile by really Getting into the swing.
Getting into the swing.
Getting into the swing.
Getting into the swing.
Getting into the swing.
Getting into the swing.
Getting into the swing.
Getting into the swing.

I'd rather dance than talk with you.
I'd rather dance than talk with you.
I'd rather dance than talk with you.
I'd rather dance than talk with you.

I'd rather dance than talk with you.
I'd rather dance than talk with you.
