Have you noticed
I've never been impressed
By your friends from New York and London?
I'll level, accusations like the press
til you realise that you've dressed yourself in tatters

Because a man's needs, man's needs
Are found on greed, are found on greed
A man's needs, man's needs
Are lost on me
A man's needs, man's needs
Are found on greed, are found on greed
A man's needs

I'm not bothered, what you say or how you dress
I'm a mess, so you've always seemed inviting
But really, this all seems quite meaningless
And I remember, that you never seem to see

The fact that men's needs, men's needs
Are found on greed, are found on greed
A man's needs, man's needs
Are lost on me
A girl's needs, girl's needs
Just don't agree, just don't agree
With a man's needs

Have you noticed, I've never been impressed
By your friends from New York and London?
But really, this all seems quite meaningless
And I remember that you never seem to see

The excuse that men's needs, men's needs
Are found on greed, are found on greed
A man's needs, man's needs
Apply to me
You say your man's needs, man's needs
Apply to me
I don't agree
A man's needs

Oh-oh! Oh-oh!
