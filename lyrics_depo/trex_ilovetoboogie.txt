We love to boogie, we love to boogie
Jitterbug boogie, Bolan pretty boogie
We love to boogie on a Saturday night

Belinda Mae Fender's got a Cadillac Bone
Jenny's lost her cherry walking all the way home
The passions of the Earth blasted it's mind
Now it's neat sweet ready for the moon based grind

We love to boogie
We love to boogie on a Saturday night
We love to boogie
High school boogie, jitterbug boogie
We love to boogie on a Saturday night

You rattlesnake out with your tailfeathers high
Jitterbug left and smile to the sky
With your black velvet cape and your stovepipe hat
Be-bop baby the dance is where it's at

We love to boogie, we love to boogie
Jitterbug boogie, Bolan pretty boogie
We love to boogie on a Saturday night

I love to boogie
Yes I love to boogie on a Saturday night
I said I love to boogie, I love to boogie
Jitterbug boogie, I love to boogie
I love to boogie on a Saturday night

I love to boogie
