Tell me why we didn't try
Tell me why you had to go
Can't you see it makes me cry
There are so many things I have to know 
Cause I still care about you
And time is long overdue

Now I pray on my knees and I look at the stars
That you would be here laying down in my arms 
I pray on my knees for you


I know that I can't turn back time
Just to undo all my mistakes
I'm not gonna cry for the rest of my days
I will do whatever it takes

Cause I still care about you
And time is long overdue

I pray on my knees
I pray on my knees 
For you

Now I pray on my knees and I look at the stars
That you would be here laying down in my arms
I pray on my knees for you
