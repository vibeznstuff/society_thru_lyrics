Oooo...every day you make me cry, girl;
I cry too much.
And today you say goodbye, girl;
it's just too much.

Hey! I swallowed each and every lie that you gave to me.
Where lies the man that I was, and the future that could never be?

Tomorrow...every one gonna know me better.
And tomorrow...every one gonna drink my wine.
And...tomorrow...every one gonna read my letter,
and my story of love, and a love that could never be mine.

Oooo...Ask you to be my wife, girl. You were playing...
Now I ask you where is my life, girl? You were saying...

Hey! I swallowed each and every lie that you gave to me.
Where lies the man that I was, and the future that could never be?

Tomorrow...every one gonna know me better.
And tomorrow...every one gonna drink my wine.
And...tomorrow...every one gonna read my letter,
and my story of love, and a love that could never be mine.

And tomorrow...every one gonna know me better.
And tomorrow...every one gonna drink my wine.
And...tomorrow...every one gonna read my letter,
and my story of love, and a love that could never be mine.
