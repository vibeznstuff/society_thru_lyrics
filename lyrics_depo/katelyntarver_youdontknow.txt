I know you've got the best intentions
Just trying to find the right words to say
I promise I already learned my lesson
But right now, I want to be not okay

I'm so tired, sitting here waiting
If I hear one more just be patient
It's always gonna stay the same

So, let me just give up
So, let me just let go 
If this isn't good for me, well I don't wanna know
Let me just stop trying
Let me just stop fighting
I don't want your good advice or reasons why I'm alright   
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like 

Can't stop these feet from sinking
And it's starting to show on me
You're staring while I'm blinking
But just don't tell me what you see
I'm so over all this bad luck 
Hearing one more keep your head up
Is it ever gonna change

So, let me just give up
So, let me just let go
If this isn't good for me, well I don't wanna know 
Let me just stop trying 
Let me just stop fighting 
I don't want your good advice, or reasons why I'm alright
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like

Don't look at me like that
Just like you understand
Don't try to pull me back

Let me just give up
Let me just let go
If this isn't good for me I don't wanna know
Let me just stop trying
Let me just stop fighting
I don't want your good advice or reasons why I'm alright
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
