Save our love 

Do you remember
All of the joy we found last spring
Oh baby
So good together
We never worried about a thing
No no
But now I see such a distance in your eyes
And the seasons come between us
I can't find my paradise
Without your love I'm a little child lost in the world
Mmm, come on baby 

Say it's not too late
I know there's time enough
Help me darling
We got to save our love
Save our love
Stay close beside me
'Coz the sky is stormy now
Come on baby, come on and save our love
Save our love 

Save our love 

Walking in circles
Thinking if all we had was gone
Oh yeah
My life would be worthless
Never known emotions could run this strong
Oh, you don't know
What went on inside of me
When you said that you'd be leaving
'Coz I hurt you selfishly
Without your love I'm as hopeless
As the earth without the sun
Oh come on baby 

Say it's not too late
I know there's time enough
Help me darling
We got to save our love
Save our love
Stay close beside me
'Coz the sky is stormy now
Come on baby, come on and save our love
Save our love 

Save our love 

So let's not fall apart
Like all those other lovers
I know if we trust
Love will leave it up to us
Oh 

Oh, say it's not too late
I know there's time enough
Help me darling
We got to save our love
Save our love
Stay close beside me
'Coz the sky is stormy now
Come on baby, come on and save our love
Save our love 

Say it's not too late
I know there's time enough
Help me darling
We got to save our love
Save our love
Stay close beside me
'Coz the sky is stormy now
Come on baby, come on and save our love
Save our love 

Stay (stay) 

Stay
