In two more years, my sweetheart, we will see another view
Such longing for the past for such completion
What was once golden has now turned a shade of grey
I've become crueler in your presence

They say "be brave, there's a right way in a wrong way"
This pain won't last forever, this pain won't last forever


Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years so hold on 

You've cried enough this lifetime, my beloved polar bear
Tears to fill a sea, to drown a beacon
To start anew all over, remove those scars from your arms
To start anew all over, more enlightened

I know, my love, this is not the only story you can tell
This pain won't last forever, this pain won't last forever



(You don't need to find answers for questions never asked of you
You don't need to find answers) 

Dead weights, balloons
Drag me to you (I've become crueler since I met you)
Dead weights, balloons
To sleep in your arms (I've become rougher, this world is killing me)



And we cover our lies with handshakes and smiles
And we try to remember our alibis
We tell lies to our parents, who hide in their rooms
We bury our secrets in the garden
Of course we could never make this love last
I said of course we could never make this love last
The only love we know is love for ourselves
We bury our secrets in the garden
