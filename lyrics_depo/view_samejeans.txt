I've had the same jeans on for four days now
I'm gonna go to a disco in the middle of the town
Everybody's dressing up
I'm dressing down

Life's one big circle
And it doesn't end
When it ends
Will you still be my friend?

I'm not making a fool of myself
Oh tell me
I'm not making a fool of myself

So
When you look in the mirror
Reflecting back at you someone that you don't know
Oh That's just made your head spin around
So get yourself together
Get your feet back on the ground

I've had the same jeans on for four days now
I'm gonna go to a disco in the middle of the town
Everybody's dressing up
I'm dressing down

I take my hats off to the busker man
When they drown all the sorrows singing songs
Now everything has worked out to plan
But believe me it started as long as it can

So
When you look in the mirror
Reflecting back at you someone that you don't know
Life's just made your head spin around
So get yourself together
Now put your feet back on the ground

I've had the same jeans on for four days now
I'm gonna go to a disco in the middle of the town
Everybody's dressing up
I'm dressing down

My minds not perfect but it's sincere
You'd be amazed at what you can achieve in a year
And you try so hard
But your hearts on a switch
And I know you try so hard
But your hearts on a switch

So
When you look in the mirror
Reflecting back at you someone that you don't know
Life's just made your head spin around
So get yourself together
Get your feet back on the ground

So
When you look in the mirror
Reflecting back at you someone that you don't know
Life's just made your head spin around
So get yourself together
Get your feet back on the ground

Same Jeans on for four days now
Everybody's dressing up I'm dressing down
I'm not making a fool of myself
Now believe me lady I can't tell

Same Jeans on for four days now
Everybody's dressing up I'm dressing down
Im not making a fool of myself
Now believe me lady I can't tell
