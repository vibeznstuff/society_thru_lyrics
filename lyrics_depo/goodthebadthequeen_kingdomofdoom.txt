Friday night in the Kingdom of Doom 
Ravens fly across the room 
All in now there's a noise in the sky 
Following all the rules and not asking why 

And when the sunset world begins 
Turning into the night I see everything in black and white and then 

Drink all day 'cos the country's at war 
You'll be falling on the palace floor 
I can't be anymore than I see 
In the flood get washed away 

When the sunset world begins 
Turning into the night I see everything in black and white and then 
A love song for the collaboration you and me will never be and then 
We'll let it flow away
