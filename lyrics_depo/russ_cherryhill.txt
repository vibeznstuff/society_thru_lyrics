You know what I'd do for you
I know what you'd do for me
You will see
The truth in me

Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I'm a fool for you
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I'm a fool for you

Feelin' lonely in this room since I was seventeen
Thought this bottle was supposed to drown my memory
But I'm still swimmin' in your vision and it's temptin' me
But next time that I call I'm hopin' that you answer me

Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I'm a fool for you
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I'm a fool for you

You know what I'd do for you
I know what you'd do for me
You will see
The truth in me

Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I'm a fool for you
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I'm a fool for you

I'm looking for the place
Where I was falling into you
Dressed in sunlight, warmed the cold
That lived inside me
We shouldn't be here
What we said
When we were
The top of Cherry Hill

Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I'm a fool for you
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I'm a fool for you

You know what I'd do for you
I know what you'd do for me
You will see
The truth in me

Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I'm a fool for you
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I'm a fool for you
