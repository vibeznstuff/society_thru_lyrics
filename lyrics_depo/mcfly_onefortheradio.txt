Here's another song for the Radio!

Life isn't fair for the people who care
Stick your nose in the air and that's how you go far
So go tell your lovers, your fathers and brothers
Your sisters and mothers, how lucky they are


Light speed, out of my mind!
I'm hurt, but I'll be fine
Put your fist in the air
Raise your voice and declare
Singing "We Don't Care!"
WE DON'T CARE!
"We Don't Care!"
WE DON'T CARE!


So here's another song for the radio
And here's another line from the heart
So don't pretend you hate us as you sing along
Cause we all look the same in the dark

L.A. temptations or music sensations
There's great expectations that weigh on our heads
So here's to the liars who dream and conspire
Against the admired, we hope you drop dead


Light speed, out of my mind!
I'm hurt, but I'll be fine
Put your fist on your chest
Raise your voice in protest
Singing "We Don't Care!"
WE DON'T CARE!
"We Don't Care!"
WE DON'T CARE!


So here's another song for the radio
And here's another line from the heart
So don't pretend you hate us as we sing our songs
Cause we all look the same in the dark


We Don't. We Don't Care!
We Don't. We Don't Care!
We Don't. We Don't Care!
We Don't. We Don't Care!


Here's one for the radio
Here's one for the radio
Here's one for the radio
Here's one for the radio


So here's another song for the radio!
And here's another line from the heart
So don't pretend you hate us when we sing our songs
Cause we all look the same in the dark


Here's another song for the radio!
(Song for the radio)
And here's another line from the heart
So don't pretend you hate us when you sing along
Cause we all look the same in the dark
(For the radio)
Cause we all look the same in the dark
We all look the same in the dark
(For the Radio)
Cause we all look the same
We all look the same in the dark!
