Hey little monster, I got my eye on you
Where are you going, where you running to?
Hey little monster, you know it's all ok
I'm gonna love you, no matter what you say

I got love on my fingers
Lust on my tongue
You say you got nothing,
So come out and get some
Heartache to Heartache,
I'm your wolf- I'm your man
I say run little monster,
Before you know who I am

Hey little creature, tell me what's on your mind,
Where've you been hiding? Can I come this time?
So pleased to please you, and rip that heart off your sleeve,
Let me discover

I got love on my fingers
Lust on my tongue
You say you got nothing,
So come out and get some
Heartache to Heartache,
I'm your wolf- I'm your man
I say run little monster,
Before you know who I am

I got love on my fingers
Lust on my tongue
You say you got nothing,
So come out and get some
Heartache to Heartache,
I'm your wolf- I'm your man
I say run little monster,
Before you know who I...

...am
