Every man has his place in time
Everyone has a loved one that they leave behind
Even though I'm not right there with you
I'm watching from a distance, just wishing that you knew

I'll always hear the prayers in your head late at night
I'm walking right beside you when nobody's by your side
I don't want you to cry over my memory
So go on without me, without me

I hope that it's my love that makes you feel
That you can get back on your feet, yeah I swear you will
Oh you got so much of this life left to live
I'll be smiling at the thought of you just like I always did

I'll always hear the prayers in your head late at night
I'm walking right beside you when nobody's by your side
I don't want you to cry over my memory
So go on without me, without me
Without me...
Without me...

I'll always hear the prayers in your head late at night
I'm walking right beside you when nobody's by your side
I don't want you to cry over my memory
So go on without me, without me

Every breath of life is short and sweet
So glad that I'm up here that I got to see
You go on without me
