Tyree Cooper, the producer
But now it's Scooter
Who are super duper
I'm the hard rhymer
The track attacker
The mic enforcer
The chick's checker

I am the law

I'm the quarterback of the scene
We bring the noise and make you scream
What?!
Candyman, that's who I am
Dave, the track attacker
The mic enforcer
The chick checker

I'm bigger and bolder and rougher and tougher
In other words, sucker, there is no other
I'm bigger and bolder and rougher and tougher
In other words, sucker, I've got no brother

Bring the break!

Posse, I need you, I need you, I need you on the floor
Posse, I need you, I need you, I need you on the floor
Posse, I need you, I need you, I need you on the floor

We need you on the floor!

Back on the track, ride on
Hot as hell, though you did not expect
What?
Candyman, the dope jam
Ice, the mad rhymer
The pitch shifter
The quick trigger

I'm bigger and bolder and rougher and tougher
In other words there is no other
I'm bigger and bolder and rougher and tougher
In other words I've got no brother

And here comes the break

Posse, I need you, I need you, I need you on the floor
Posse, I need you, I need you, I need you on the floor

We need you on the floor!

Yeah, we want some posse
Check your watch, we'll never stop
Posse, don't get asleep
Rock to the beat, rock to the beat,
Rock to the beat, now!

Hands up in the air!
Come on!

Posse, I need you, I need you, I need you on the floor
Posse, I need you, I need you, I need you on the floor

Posse, I need you, I need you, I need you on the floor
Posse, I need you, I need you, I need you on the floor

We need you on the floor!

Heiligeili!
