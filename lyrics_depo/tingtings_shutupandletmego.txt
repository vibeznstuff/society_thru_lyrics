Shut up and let me go
This hurts, I tell you so
For the last time you will kiss my lips
Now shut up and let me go!

Your jeans were once so clean, I bet  you changed your wardrobe since we met
Now oh so easily your over me
Gone is love

It's you that ought to be holding me
I'm not containable
This turns up it's not sustainable.
I ain't freakin', I ain't fakin' this
I ain't freakin', I ain't fakin' this
I ain't freakin', I ain't fakin' this
Shut up and let me go, hey!

Shut up and let me go
This hurts, what I can't show
For the last time you had me in bits
Now shut up and let me go
For fear of living in regret I changed this one when we first met
Now oh so easily your over me
Gone is love
It's me that ought to be moving on
You're not adorable
I was something unignorable.
I ain't freakin', I ain't fakin' this
I ain't freakin', I ain't fakin' this
I ain't freakin', I ain't fakin' this
Shut up and let me go, hey!
Oh, love, hold, this.
Hey!

Hey!
Shut up and let me go
This hurts, I told you so
For the last time you will kiss my lips
Now shut up and let me go, hey!
