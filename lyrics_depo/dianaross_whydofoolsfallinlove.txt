Ooh-wah, ooh-wah
Ooh-wah, ooh-wah
Ooh-wah, ooh-wah
Why do fools fall in love

Why do birds sing so gay
And lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love
Why does the rain
Fall from up above
Why do fools fall in love
Why do they fall in love

Love is a losing game
Love can be a shame
I know of a fool you see
For that fool is me
Tell my why
Tell me why

Why do birds sing so gay
And lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love
Why does the rain
Fall from up above
Why do fools fall in love
Why do they fall in love

Why does my heart skip a crazy beat
For I know
It will reach defeat
Tell me why
Tell my why
Why do fools fall in love
