Step Back! 
Gonna come at you fast
I'm driving out of control and getting ready to crash
Won't stop shaking up what I can
I serve it up in a shot
So suck it down like a man

So baby yes I know what I am
and no I don't give a damn
and you'll be loving it

Some days I'm a super bitch
Up to my old tricks
but it wont last forever
Next day I'm your super girl
Out to save the world
and it keeps getting better

Kiss kiss
Gonna tell you right now
I make it sweet on the lips
I'll simply knock you out
Shut up!
I don't care what you say
Cause when were both in the wind
you gonna like it my way
Yeah baby theres a feeling in me
So sexy sour and sweet
and you'll be loving it

Some days I'm a super bitch (super bitch)
Up to my old tricks 
but it wont last forever (no)
Next day I'm your super girl (your super girl)
Out to save the world 
and it keeps getting better

Hold on
Keeps getting better
Hold on
Keeps getting better

In the break of the night
In the speed of the light
I hold the universe up
I'll make your planets collide
When I strap on my boots
and I slip on my suit
You see the vixen in me
Becomes an angel for you

Some days I'm a super bitch (a super bitch)
Up to my old tricks
but it wont last forever (won't last forever no)
Next day I'm your super girl (super girl)
Out to save the world 
and it keeps getting better

Some days I'm a super bitch (a super bitch)
Up to my old tricks
but it wont last forever (forever no)
Next day I'm your super girl
Out to save the world 
and it keeps getting better

Hold on
Keeps getting better
Hold on
Keeps getting better
