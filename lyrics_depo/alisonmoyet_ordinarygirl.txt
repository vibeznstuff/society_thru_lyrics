She left on Sunday afternoon,
"It is the only way for everyone concerned" she said
And I could only ask her why,
But she just smiled and told me, one day I would learn

"Don't you worry, this will all make sense tomorrow,
Don't be sorry, that everything we shared will fade away
There's so much to see in each new day,
They'd never understand, I'm not an ordinary girl"

She took nothing but her clothes
Taking more would just remind her of her past, she said
I thought I'd never laugh again
On the day I said goodbye to my best friend

And now I understand, she's just an ordinary girl
