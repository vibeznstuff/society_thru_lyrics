I got it bad, you don't know how bad I got it
You got it easy, you don't know when you've got it good
It's getting harder just keeping life and soul together
I'm sick of fighting, even though I know I should

The cold is biting through each and every nerve and fiber
My broken spirit is frozen to the core
I don't want to be here no more

Wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes
Even if it was for just one day
Wouldn't it be good if we could wish ourselves away

Wouldn't it be good to be on your side
The grass is always greener over there
Wouldn't it be good if we could live without a care

You must be joking, you don't know a thing about it
You've got no problem, I'd stay right there if I were you
I got it harder, you couldn't dream how hard I got it
Stay out of my shoes if you know what's good for you

The heat is stifling, burning me up from the inside
The sweat is coming through each and every pore
I don't want to be here no more
I don't want to be here no more
I don't want to be here no more

Wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes
Even if it was for just one day
Wouldn't it be good if we could wish ourselves away, ooh

Wouldn't it be good to be on your side
The grass is always greener over there
And wouldn't it be good if we could live without a care

I got it bad, you don't know how bad I got it
You got it easy, you don't know when you've got it good
It's getting harder just keeping life and soul together
I'm sick of fighting, even though I know I should
