Turn the lights low
And put some music on
Let our bodies sing
Swing 2 the soft song
I feel ya heat
It's turning me on
I wanna feel ya all night long so
Come close, as close as U can
I surrender you're so tender and tanned
I wanna toss, I wanna tumble
Feel and fumble, I wanna do it
Till my belly rumbles
So lay back and
Close your eyes and
While I fiddle U can fantasize
Yeah
While I fiddle U can fantasize

Deep baby deep deep down
Like sleep sugar, so rest upon my chest

What ya body wants
I got dis
Whatcha need indeed
I'm gonna rock this
I dream U scream and tighten ya hold
I tiggle in the middle as we giggle
In I go, oh, deep and down deeper
Like an ocean
As I push I blow ya emotions
You explode, like dynamite
U got the fuse but to ya fuse I got the light
Together we swing
Shh!, I hear our souls sing
A symphony, a lovers harmony
Yeah,
Can U hear the harmony?

Deep baby deep deep down
Like sleep sugar, so rest upon my chest

I'm gonna kiss ya from ya head 2 ya toes and then
I'm gonna lick ya where you'd love me to go, yeah!
Oil ya skin within hold ya tight
Yeah, I butter the toast
If U lick the knife
And take a shower
Maybe bubble the bath
I'll wash yours, U wash mine
Yeah, we'll have a good laugh
I'll be the sponge, the sponge
The sponge that wets U down
Then I'll be the towel upon
Your naked body, wrapped around
And then as our game comes 2 an end
We'll start again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Deep baby deep deep down
Like sleep sugar, so rest upon my chest
Deep baby deep deep down
Like sleep sugar, so rest upon my chest
