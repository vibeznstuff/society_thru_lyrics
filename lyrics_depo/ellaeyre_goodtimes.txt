Dark days holding me down
And it's so grey, got my head in the cloud
And you
You feel it too
But I told you that we'd figure it out
All these old fools that we're better without
And you
You know it's true, yeah

But tell me, tell me
Tell me what it is that you need
Cause I think I'm onto something
Cause I feel the good times coming
Tell me, tell me
Tell me what it is that you need
Cause I think I'm onto something
Cause I feel the good times coming

Cause I think I'm onto something
Cause I feel the good times coming
Cause I think I'm onto something
Cause I feel the good times coming
Tell me, tell me what it is that you need
Cause I think I'm onto something
Cause I feel the good times coming
(Cause I feel the good times coming)

We're getting by, we've done it before
All the nightmares that I've learned to ignore
And you
You've been there too
But somehow I can settle the score
Cause I know now that I need more
And you
You know it too, yeah

But tell me, tell me
Tell me what it is that you need
Cause I think I'm onto something
Cause I feel the good times coming
Tell me, tell me
Tell me what it is that you need
Cause I think I'm onto something
Cause I feel the good times coming

Cause I think I'm onto something
Cause I feel the good times coming
Cause I think I'm onto something
Cause I feel the good times coming

Cause I think I'm onto something
Cause I feel the good times coming
Cause I think I'm onto something
Cause I feel the good times coming

Tell me, tell me what it is that you need
Cause I think I'm onto something
Cause I feel the good times coming
(Cause I feel the good times coming)

What is it that you need?
What is it that you need?

But tell me, tell me
Tell me what it is that you need
Cause I think I'm onto something
Cause I feel the good times coming
Tell me, tell me
Tell me what it is that you need
Cause I think I'm onto something
Cause I feel the good times coming

Cause I think I'm onto something
Cause I feel the good times coming
Cause I think I'm onto something
Cause I feel the good times coming
