On A Bright Day She Passed Away
In The Morning It's A Cruel Way
To Take Her Away With No Warning
He Took Her Hand Through Every Midnight Hour
And Then He Saw Her Fading Away Like A Spring Shower


I Can See A Complete Life's Time
Pictures And Posters Of Times And Fashion
Nineteen Years With No Reason Or Rhyme
Taken Away In A Crime Of Passion

He Stood To See If He Could Catch Her Breathing
But I Was No Good He Understood She Was Leaving
He Looked Outside The Frosty Window Pane
And Then He Saw Her Moving Away Elizabeth Jane



I See Freedom In Sight It's A Long Climb
But She Would Not Give Up The Fight For A Long Time
And I See A Light Come Shining Into Night
Baby It's All Right We Couldn't Have Changed It Was
Second Sight



I See Freedom Light Shining In The Night
I See Freedom But She Wouldn't Give Up The Fight
I See Her Light Come Shining Into Night
Baby It's All Right We Couldn't Have Changed It Was
Second Sight

I See A Light Come Shining Into Night
Baby It's All Right We Couldn't Have Changed It Was
Second Sight
