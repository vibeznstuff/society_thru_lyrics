And while the city sleeps
I won't weep because I didn't keep
My boyfriend and the summer's end is here again
And the leaves are golden
Under the grand silver birch tree

While we're thinking bout the people we meet
Dancing feet, wasters on the cover of a magazine
People you've kissed, people you lust
And the one's that you might not
Ever remember what's the use

I'm not what I was last summer
Not who I was in the spring
Tell me, tell me, tell me when will we learn
We love it and we leave it and we watch it burn
Damn these wild young hearts
Damn these wild young hearts

Now that the city's awake, my heart aches
Oh what a silly mistake it seems I've made
You left your keys under my bed
Left a thumpin in my head
I would say sorry, what's the use

Cause, I'm not what I was last September
And I don't wear the same robes in May
We know we shouldn't do it, but we do it anyway
We know we might regret it but it seemed ok
Damn this wild young heart
Damn this wild young heart
Damn this wild young heart

If now is forever then what's to prove
Cause it won't be the same next summer
And I guess I'll see you in the spring
Somebody tell me, tell me, tell me, when will I learn
I love it and I leave it and I watch it burn
Damn this wild young heart
I told you damn this wild young heart
Damn this wild young
Tell me, tell me, tell me when will I learn
Damn this wild young heart
