I try a little bit of this, ease your pain
I try a little bit of that and more
Cause I know what and when you need it
It's you that I adore
So tell me why, tell me why
Why you keep your distance.

Why do you try to resist
Every time I insist
My love, my love, my love, my love.

Do you really want me
Do you really want me.

Every time you bring me up
You bring me down
It really breaks my heart
I could never say goodbye
Never stay apart
It's a crime, it's a crime
We can't stay together
Cause I got nothing to hide
I just want you to try
My love, my love, my love.

Do you really want me
Do you really want me.

And it's a shame
That you keep your distance
Why do your try to resist
Every time I insist
My love, my love, my love, my love.

Do you really want me
Do you really want me.
