Il me plait d'etre avec tu. 
Je ne sais pas ou ­ ou le temps s'est enfui. 
Oh je t'aime mon chri.

Funny how time flies when you're having fun
Ooh baby
Funny how time flies when you're having fun (fun)
Oh baby

I don't know where it all went
Time passed us by
Just when it seemed the fun began
Ooh

Funny how time flies when you're having fun, please stay
Funny how time flies (please stay) when you're having fun, mmm

But time never ends
Let's find the time
To get together once again, someday soon

Funny how time flies when you're having fun, mmm, yeah, hoo
Funny how time flies when you're having fun (fun)

Don't you ever leave
(Funny how time flies when you're having fun)
Don't you ever go
Say you love me so
(Funny how time flies when you're having fun)
Mmm

Funny how time flies when you're having fun
When you're having fun, yeah, hmhmm
Funny how time flies when you're having fun (fun)

Je ne sais pas ou le temps s'est enfui. 
Il me plait d'etre  avec tu.

I really don't know where all the time went
I really have to go
Stop, stop
Oh I really have to go
Oh, I really have to go
One more time?

Oh je t'aime mon cheri.

Oh - oh, oh
