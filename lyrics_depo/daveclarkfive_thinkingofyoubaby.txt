I'm thinkin' of you baby every day and night
I'm thinkin' of you baby every day and night
Now I don't want no other lover
'Cause I, I know you're gonna treat me right
You're gonna treat me right, no!

I'm thinkin' of you baby and all the things that you said
I'm thinkin' of you baby and all the things that you said
Oh when your mama and papa told me
Well-a, it nearly drove me outta my head
Whoa, it drove me outta my head, now

The things we used to do
And all the fun that we had
It makes me feel mad
To think you used to love me
And now you're makin' me feel sad
I feel so bad, oh!

I'm thinkin' of you baby every day and night
I'm thinkin' of you baby every day and night
Now I don't want no other lover
'Cause I, I know you're gonna treat me right
You're gonna treat me right

Well I'm thinkin' of you baby every day and night
I said I'm thinkin' of you baby every day and night
Now I don't want no other lover
'Cause I, I know you're gonna treat me right
You're gonna treat me right, oh!
