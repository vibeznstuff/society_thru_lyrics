OK is what you say when
you’re ready to ball
We’re too hot for club
they ain’t ready at all
And if you come to party
then get up off the wall
Quick we don’t slip,
make hits on a regular
Club spots get rocked
when we come in
Ok round my neck and wrist
I’m looking stunning
About to go by the bar,
are you coming

OK now let me tell you
what this song is all about
Party people let me hear
you scream and shout
Without a doubt
Cause I am about to
turn this whole party out
I know that you’re feeling this
Cause I see you bumping
all your heads to this
Especially the men cos
they be feeling this bliss
Cause they see the ladies
all shaking their hips
Don’t just stand there, throw
your hands up in the air
And you sitting down just
get up off the chair
You don’t see a party
going on over there



If you got a job and
money in your pocket
Let me hear you say (OK!)
All my ladies if y’all don’t care
Let me hear you say (OK!)
And if that’s your car
parked outside the
Bar let me hear you say (OK!)
And if you’re dressed to
impress, you don’t take stress
Let me hear you say (OK!)

Well it’s the year 2G,
gotta get your own
Gotta have your home
get your phone
Getting money from your
man that’s a NO NO
Gotta get a job so you get paid
Gotta get a man so you get,
I know you understand
Now for the men gotta
ditch your friends
Gotta meet your ends.. so
you can drive a new benz.
Move out your mum’s
gotta get some garms
Gotta fix up be a real man.
So.......



If you got a job and
money in your pocket

And if you’re dressed to
impress, you don’t take stress
Let me hear you say (OK!)

Pulled up on chrome,
left wifey back at home
Got some fresh gear, and
all kinds of ice on
Gotta pocket full of doe, you know
If you got the same things
Let me hear you go, Okay
We’re gonna party till
the break of day
B B coming through,
and we’re here to stay
Better make way
And if you got game,
its time to play
I’m trying to find me a dime
That just say, okay
