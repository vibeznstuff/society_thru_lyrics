Two wheels a turnin' 
One girl a yearnin' 
Big motor burnin' the road 

I'll ride the highway 
I'm going my way 
I'll leave a story untold 

Pretty girls behind me but pretty girls are everywhere 
Big motor wind up, ride away from here 

Ride away 

She won't approve of things I do or what I am 
And I don't really give a ... I understand 
But she'll never see that I'll never be 
Any one but me 

She thinks she needs me, she cries for me 
But I know she's lying, crying for others to see 
What can I say, I'll just ride away 

Big motor run run (background) ride ride away 
Ride on away from big motor run run 
Heart-ache and misery 

I'm bound to wander 
Way over yonder 
Someone be waitin' just for me 

True love to cling to, I need a dream to share 
Someone to know me, Someone to show me they care 

Ride away, ride away 
From tears and sorrow 
Like there's no tomorrow 

Tonight I'll ride away
