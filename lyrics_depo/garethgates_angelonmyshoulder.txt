My life was flashing before my eyes
A second later, I walked and realized
My heart had crashed and burned in shame
You pulled me from the flames
I took your hand and you helped me upon my feet
I confessed but you had forgiven me
There's courage in the truth you said
Our love will never end
You shield me from danger, you're my shelter 
You are my hiding place

There's an Angel on my shoulder, here tonight
Making sure that I'm alright
When I'm falling fast, you rescue me, you love unconditionally
And when I'm cold and so alone
Back in your arms I feel at home
I pray that you will always be, a Guardian Angel
Sent for me

My dream comes between us every now and then
I make mistakes, get in trouble, time and again
I ain't proud of who I am
When I'm down you understand
Blinded you can always seem to show the way 
You're the light You're the reason I'm here today
If you cry, I cry, So dry your eyes

There's an Angel on my shoulder, here tonight
Making sure that I'm alright
When I'm falling fast, you rescue me, you love unconditionally
And when I'm cold and so alone
Back in your arms I feel at home
I pray that you will always be, a Guardian Angel
Sent for me
