When I opened up my eyes today 
Felt the sun shining on my face 
It became so clear to me that everything is going my way 
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see 
Got rid of fears that were holding me 
My endless possibilities 
Has the whole world opened for me 
That's why I'm feeling... 


I'm feeling so good 
I knew I would 
Been taking care of myself 
Like I should 
'Cause not one thing 
Can bring me down 
Nothing in this world gonna turn me round... 

Now the day is turning into night 
And everything is still going right 
There's no way you can stop me this time 
Or break this spirit of mine 
Like the stars above I'm gonna shine 
Anything I want will be mine 
Tonight I'm gonna have a good time 
Call a few friends of mine 
'Cause I'm loving life 
And tonight's for feeling...
