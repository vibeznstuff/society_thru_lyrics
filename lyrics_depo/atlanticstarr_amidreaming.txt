Things are kind of hazy
And my head's all cloudy inside
And I've heard talk of angels
I never thought I'd have one to call mine

See you are
Just too good to be true
And I hope
This is not some kind of mirage with you

Am I dreaming (Well, well, well, well)
Am I just imagining you're here win my life
Am I dreaming (Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Pinch me to see if it's real 'cause my mind can't decide

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (Whoa)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Will this last for one night
Or do I have you for a lifetime
Please say that it's forever
And that it's not an illusion to my eyes

And I hope
That you don't run out and disappear
My love, I pray
That it's not a hoax and it's for real

Am I dreaming (Am I dreaming) (Baby, baby)
Am I just imagining you're here in my life (You're here and you're mine)
Am I dreaming (Is this a dream, baby, baby) (Oh...)
Pinch me to see (Whoa, whoa) if it's real 'cause my mind can't decide (Can't decide)

Sometimes, sometimes (Sometimes, baby)
I need you to show me, show me that it's not a mirage (No, baby)
(I need you, I need you, I need you to pinch me)
Pinch me to see if it's real 'cause my mind can't decide (Tell me) (Tell me, tell me, baby)

Am I dreaming (Am I dreaming, oh, yeah)
Am I just imagining you're here in my life (You're here in my life)
Am I dreaming (Oh, no, oh, no, baby)
Pinch me to see if it's real 'cause my mind can't decide

Am I dreaming (Dream)
Am I just imagining you're here in my life
Am I dreaming
