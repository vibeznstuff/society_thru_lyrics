Crazy...
I'm crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy...
Crazy for feeling so blue

I knew
You'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday
You'd leave me for somebody new

Worry...
Why do I let myself worry
Wondering
What in the world did I do?

Crazy
For thinking that my love could hold you...

I'm crazy for trying
I'm crazy for crying
And I'm crazy
For loving you

Crazy
For thinking that my love could hold you...

I'm crazy for trying
I'm crazy for crying
And I'm crazy
For loving you
