Whoah
Made it back

Oh yeah
(representing BK)

From a place that had no meaning
From the wilderness of time
To the land of new beginning
Starting with a new design

Never doubted for a second
That I'd do it on my own
And I held on to my corner
Trusted in the things I know

You will never feel how good it is to love me
Rather than control me
I don't need the world weighing down my shoulders
But that's all, over here I am

I (oh I)
Made it back (from a place called nowhere)
I (oh I)
Made it back (to do this once again said...)
I (oh I)
Made it back (from a place called nowhere)
I (oh I)
Made it back (once again I made it back)

Got a chance to fix up neatly
Set it off and not too late
Saw the light and walked towards it
I'm the master of my fate (yo beverley)

Coming up just wasn't easy
It took all the strength I had
Now I'm ready for the action
Mama's got a brand nu bag

You will never feel how good it is to love me
Rather than control me (rather than control me baby)
I don't need the world (don't need it) weighing down my shoulders (weighing down my shoulder, no, no)
But that's all, over here I am (say..)

I (oh I)
Made it back (from a place called nowhere)
I (oh I)
Made it back (to do this once again said...)
I (oh I)
Made it back (from a place called nowhere)
I (oh I)
Made it back (to do this once again say..)
I (oh I)
Made it back (from a place called nowhere)
I (oh I)
Made it back (once again I made it back)

As I proceed to put in in high speed
I leave MC's like Chris Reeves when I breathe
And next time a record label jug Beverley
I'ma do something to ya the corroner's never seen
Flatten London with a half an ounce
Same thing is picking up on the path and bounce
Redman, spit on the concrete turn to sand
Show how to burn next to the man, next to the man
Hash -- smell the gun
Still young
Still hit ya doorbell and run
Flava (hmm yeah)
Flava (ooh yeah)
Flava
Brand new flava (yeah)
Flava (yeah)
Flava (yeah)
Brand new flava (oh yeah)
Flava (oh yeah)
Flava (hell yeah)
Brand new flava (oh yeah)
Flava (oh yeah)
Flava (oh yeah)

Once again I made it back
(oh I)
Made it back (from a place called nowhere)
I (oh I)
Made it back (to do this once again said...)
I (oh I)
Made it back (from a place called nowhere)
I (oh I)
Made it back (once again I made it back)

I (oh I)
Made it back (from a place called nowhere)
I (oh I)
Made it back
I (oh I)
Made it back (from a place called nowhere)
I (oh I)
Made it back (once again I made it back)
