You hurt me so bad

I was building a palace in my mind
just for you and me
I made you the centre of my world 
though you couldn't see
I thought we'd walk together
The road would run forever
I can follow no further
til I get commitment from you 
Whatchya gonna do?

Oh baby
What kind of answer is maybe? 
Oh, oh-oh-oh
You hurt me so bad
Oh baby
Thought you were the last train to safety 
Oh, oh-oh-oh
You hurt me so bad

In this world of indifference 
I expected so much more from you 
But the more that I listen
the less I believe is true
I've got understanding
Now my heart's commanding
I can follow no further
til I get an answer from you
Whatchya gonna do?

Oh baby
What kind of answer is maybe? 
Oh, oh-oh-oh
You hurt me so bad
Oh baby
Thought you were the last train to safety 
Oh, oh-oh-oh
You hurt me so bad
