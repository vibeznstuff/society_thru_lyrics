Rainy day
Stormy night
She couldn't stay
It wasn't right
She never cried
She's very strong
I always tried
When it went wrong

It's nothing new
When you lose
But getting through's
No pleasure cruise
She never lied
I heard them say
She hit the slide
And fell away

Well, it must have been love
That let her down
Yeah, it must have been love
Pushed her around
Looking for love
She never found
Must have been love
Must have been love
Must have been love

She spends her time
On an endless search
Now it's a crime
Keeps getting hurt
She never learns
Takes it day by day
Then she gets burned
And turned away

I said it must have been love
That let her down
Yeah, it must have been love
Pushed her around and around
Looking for love
She never found
Must have been love
Must have been love

She never learns
Takes it day by day
Then she gets burned
And turned away

I said it must have been love
That let her down
Well, it must have been love
Pushed her around and around
Looking for love
She never found
Must have been love
Must have been love
Must have been love

Must have been love
That let her down
Said it must have been love
Pushed her around and around
Looking for love
She never found
Must have been love
Must have been love
Must have been love
Looking for love
Must have been love
