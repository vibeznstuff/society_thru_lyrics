(She's so) 20th century
(She's so) 1970s
(She knows) the right things to say
(She's got) the right clothes to wear
'Cause she's a modern girl (oh, yeah)
A modern girl, yeah (g-g-g-girl)
A modern girl, now (oh, yeah)

And Suzie is a jewel
She flashes when she smiles
She's cunning and she's clever
She's got the lowdown in her files
Magenta is the best
You know, she really makes me laugh
She's always tryin' her impressions
She wants to be a photograph, I gotta say it now

(She's so) 20th century
(She's so) 1970s
(She knows) the right things to say
(She's got) the right clothes to wear
'Cause she's a modern girl (oh, yeah)
A modern girl, yeah (g-g-g-girl)
A modern girl, now (oh, yeah)

She's so modern

And Jean confided to me
She's Mona Lisa's biggest fan
She drew a mustache on her face
She's always seen her as a man
And Charlie ain't no Nazi
She likes to wear her leather boots
'Cause it's exciting for the veterans
And it's a tonic for the troops

(She's so) 20th century
(She's so) 1970s
(She knows) the right things to say
(She's got) the right clothes to wear
'Cause she's a modern girl (oh, yeah)
A modern girl, yeah (g-g-g-girl)
A modern girl, now (oh, yeah)

She's so modern

(She's so) 20th century

(She knows) the right things to say
(She's got) the right clothes to wear
I tell you
(She's so) 20th century
(She's so) 1970s
(She knows) the right things to say
(She's got) the right clothes to wear

She's so (modern)
