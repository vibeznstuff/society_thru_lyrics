Strolling along minding my own business
Well there goes a girl and a half 
She's got me going up and down
She's got me going up and down
It's only your imagination
Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches
See her for a moment
Well I got the notion girl that you got some suntan lotion in that bottle of yours
Spread it all over my peelin' skin baby
That feels real good
All this skirt lappin' up the sun 
Lap me up
Why don't you come on and
Lap me up
Just what it is that brings her here
Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches
See her for a moment
Well there goes another one just lying down on the sand dunes
I'd better go take a swim and see if I can cool down a little bit
Coz you and me woman 
We got a lotta things on our minds (you know what I mean)
Covering everything
Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches
Stars in the window
Will you just take a look over there (where?) there
Is she tryin' to get outta that clitares?
Liberation for women 
Thats what I preach
Preacher man
The air is like a murmur
Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches
All at once there's someone there
Oh shit 
There goes the charabang
Looks like I'm gonna be stuck here the whole summer
Well what a bummer
I can think of a lot worse places to be
Like down in the streets
Or down in the sewer 
Or even on the end of a skewer
