Don't let the sun go down, On an Empire,
It's too much to waste. Don't let the walls come down,
Round an Empire, It's too much to wave goodbye.

We've been working for a long time,
We've been fighting for a way,
Now in the streets men standing in lines they're all wasted anyway.
You're living in an incestuous world,
Where you're conscious holds no weight,
You sold us down the river like rats then,
You drowned and beat the brave.

You're not alone you know,  you're not alone you know
You're not alone no no.

Don't let the sunâ€¦ too much to wash away.

You're not alone you know, you're not alone you know
You're not alone no no. (yeah, yeah)
(Not alone, not alone)
There's just too many dreams in this wasteland for you to leave us all behind.

You're not alone no no.
