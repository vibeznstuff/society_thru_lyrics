A man inside a room is shaking hands with other men
This is how it happens
Our carefully laid plans

Shake it, shake it baby
Shake your ass out in that street
You're gonna make 'em scream someday
You're gonna make it big

You love so deep, so tender
Your people and your land
You love 'em 'til they can't recall
Who they are again

Work it, work it baby
Work your way 'round that room
You're gonna make it big some day
You're gonna make a boom

But I am
But I am
But I am not a number, not a name

But I am
But I am
But I am a carefully laid plan

Shake what your mama gave you
You know that it won't last
You're gonna taste the ground real soon
You're gonna taste the grass

A man inside a room is shaking hands with other men
This is how it happens
Our world under command

Shake it, shake it baby
Shake your ass out in that street
You're gonna make us scream someday
You're gonna make us weep

You're gonna make us scream someday
You're gonna make it big
