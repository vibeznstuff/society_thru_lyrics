If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
Ba-ba-bass, bass, bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low

And my bass down low
Bass, bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast

It's like one, two, three, fuck it
I'm bout to take this drink and just stuff it
Fish tank this thing along with four more shots
of Patron I give a fuck about going home
Straight buzzin Robotussin
Wanna get ya mitts in my oven
Wanna get a lick of this lovin
G-g-g-get a lick of this lovin
Yeah, I like it loud
And I'll make you shout
G-give you that Black Eyed Peas
You know that Boom Boom Pow
