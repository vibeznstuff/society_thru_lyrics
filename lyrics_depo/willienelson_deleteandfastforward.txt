Delete and fast forward my friend
The wars are all over and nobody wins
But don't worry too much, it'll drive you crazy again
So delete and fast forward my friend

Delete and fast forward my son
The elections are over and nobody won
You think it's all ending but it's just settin' in
So delete and fast forward my friend

Delete and fast forward again
It's just one big circle and it's beginning again
What's next was now and what's now is now then
So delete and fast forward again

Delete and fast forward the news
The truth is the truth but believe what you choose
When we blow the whole world back to where it began
Just delete and fast forward again

Delete and fast forward again
It's just one big circle and it's beginning again
What's next was now and what's now is now then
So delete and fast forward again

We had a chance to be brilliant and we blew it again
So delete and fast forward my friend
Delete and fast forward again
