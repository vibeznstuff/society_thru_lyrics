Borne on the wind,
Borne on the wind,
Between the sunset and the dawn.
So tenderly your memory
Lingers with me on and on

Borne on the wind,
Borne on the wind
You are still with me it seems
A life to live, a love to give,
And you will live in my dreams.

You don't love me,
But you love for me to be in love with you.
You lured me on,led me on
But when I fell you were gone.

Borne on the wind,
Borne on the wind,
Now a song in my heart.
A soft refrain you will remain
To live in my heart again

Borne on the wind,
Borne on the wind,
Borne on the wind.
