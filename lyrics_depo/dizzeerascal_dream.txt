I'm not gonna pull this off man without signing the dots
This is too sensible for me man
How you gonna have a dream come true?


I used to dream about crazy little things like fame,
In the days hanging outside the off licence,
We used to run around the streets reckless with no shame,
Mainly up to no good a whole world of nonsense
And when the girls would walk by we would try to catch their eye,
And if they didn't show face we would act immature,
Had a thing for south and hackney girls since I was a kid,
A couple of west girls on my radar I was raw,
And I was dead sure that I knew it all,
The whole world got my attitude I nearly blew it all,
I find it a real big struggle getting through it all,
I swear I didn't wanna listen 'cause I sure didn't care,
Not knowing for reality that I'd have to prepare,
'cause money don't grow on no stick, well it's rare,
Me and boy was still looking less and less the lick,
Plus I was growing up, life was looking as a scare


Happy talking, talking, happy talk,
Talk about things you like to do,
You got to have a dream,
If you don't have a dream,
How you gonna have a dream come true?


I used to love music it was like my hidden hobby,
But I couldn't get on on local radio back then,
So I went to north London and trot to tottenham to be precise,
And got some air time on heat FM,
And then it escalated I was getting ratings here and there,
And carried on until eventually I was everywhere,
I started doing all the hot spots ministry ceasers palace p area time and envy,
I did the grim and the glam,
I done the poor and the posh,
I didn't hang around I wanted my money in a rush,
Mind frame in the studio at this stage,
No time to chat I didn't wanna n-gage,
I found myself a new hustle it was beautiful,
A none like the one before a bit more suitable,
The more challenging it got the more I thought it,
Made an album over 100,000 people bought it
Thank you




To all the young girls catching on the stares in the flats,
With the superstar sockalings Beckham in the making,
you can go far if you put your mind to it,
You're a star, don't wait to be told, just do it,
Try to keep school in your plans don't be worrying about your mans,
They'll be there in the end if they're real, if they ain't,
Don't be making no effort to impress 'cause you'll find out where you are just do what you feel,
Young baby mother I got your back as well,
Young baby fathers hold it down for your girl,
I ain't trying to preach but for what it's worth,
That kid's the next generation planet earth,
Big shout to the world 'cause I've been all around,
And when I'm gone I'm always thinking about my home town,
I'm from the LDN there's no forgetting that,
And the big UK I stay repping that



You love that
You tell me you don't love that
