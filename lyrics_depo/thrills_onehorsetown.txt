Yeah you're burning
Oh you're burning
My ears with your travelling tales

But my in laws;
Oh baby my in laws
They're trying to tie a young man down

Well i never should have settled down
Hanging around in a one horse town
When everyone started sleeping around

But this feeling
That I'm feeling
Well you're preying on a tender heart

So this evening
Oh baby I'm leaving
On a one way ticket tonight

Well i never should have settled down
Hanging around in a one horse town
When everyone started sleeping around

I guess i never should have settled down
You see hanging around in a one horse town
Does nothing for your state of mind
