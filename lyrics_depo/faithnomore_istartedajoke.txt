I started a joke 
Which started the whole world crying 
Oh but I didn't see 
That the joke was on me...oh no.. 
And I started to cry 
Which started the whole world laughing 
Oh if I'd only seen 
That the joke was on me 

And I looked at the skies 
Running my hands 
Over my eyes 
And I fell out of bed 
Cursing my head 
For things that I've said 
Till I finally died 
Which started the whole world living 
Oh if I'd only seen 
That the joke was on me 

And I looked at the skies 
Running my hands 
Over my eyes 
And I fell out of bed 
Cursing my head 
For things that I've said 

Till I finally died 
Which started the whole world living 
Oh if I'd only seen 
That the joke was on me 
That the joke was on me.........me.........
