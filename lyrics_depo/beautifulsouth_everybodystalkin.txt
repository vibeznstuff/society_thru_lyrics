Everybody's talkin' at me.
I can't hear a word they're sayin',
Only the echoes of my mind.

People stoppin' starin'
I can't see their faces,
Only the shadows of their eyes.

I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Thru the pourin' rain,
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes.

Backin' off the northeast wind and,
Sailin' on a summer breeze,
Trippin' over the ocean like a stone.

Woh Woh Woh

I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Thru the pourin' rain,
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes.

Backin' off the northeast wind,
Sailin' on a summer breeze,
Trippin' over the ocean like a stone,
Like a stone

Everybody's talkin' at me.

Woh Woh Woh
