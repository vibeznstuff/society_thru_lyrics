Hi, my name is Bob, and I approve this message...


I got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold
Everybody knows I got the magic in me
When I hit the floor the girls come snapping at me
Now everybody wants a blast of magic
Magic, magic, magic
( M M) Magic, magic, magic
( M M M) Magic, magic, magic
Ah ooooooo
I got the magic in me


The trick that I'll attempt will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse I'll hypnotize you with every line
I'll need a volunteer how about you with the eyes
Come on down to the front, sit right here and don't be shy
I'll have you time traveling, have your mind babbling
People trying to inherit the skills so they asking me
Even David Blaine had to go and take some classes in
I see Mind Freak like what's up man what's happening
So come one, come all and see the show tonight
Prepared to be astounded no ghosts or poltergeists
You know I'm no Pinocchio and never told a lie
So call me mister magic man I float on cloud 9


I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track in turns into gold (yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the floor the girls come snapping at me (they be snappin', baby)
Now everybody wants a blast of magic
Magic, magic, magic
( M M) Magic, magic, magic
( M M M) Magic, magic, magic
Ah oooooooo
I got the magic in me


Well take a journey into my mind
You'll see why it's venom I rhyme
Stay on the road so I call my mama when I got time I hit the stage go insane and jump into that crowd
See, see when I rhyme flow on the beat like pidda-da-da
See I deceive ya with my intergalactic ether
I sing just like Aretha, so respect me like I'm Caesar
I kick it like Adidas, blowing sticky like adhesive Be cautious 'cause what I be on will leave you with amnesia
I break all the rules like Evel Knievel
It's a spectacular show cause my heart pumps diesel
So whatever you saying it don't entertain my ego
I do this every day Hocus Pocus here's my steelo


I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track in turns into gold (yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the floor the girls come snapping at me (they be snappin', baby)
Now everybody wants a blast of magic
Magic, magic, magic
( M M) Magic, magic, magic
( M M M) Magic, magic, magic
Ah oooooooo
I got the magic in me
