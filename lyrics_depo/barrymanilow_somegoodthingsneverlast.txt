It's three in the morning
You're no were in sight
And all that I wanted was to be with you tonight

The love in your eyes
Is fading so fast
No matter how hard we try
Some good things never last

But what good is holding on
When you know
That all you can think about
Is letting go
They say if you love someone
Then set them free
If they come back again
Then in the end
It was meant to be
I thought we were lovers
I thought we were friends
I guess when reality steps in
It all depends

We live for the future
We learn from the past
No matter how hard we try
Some good things never last

When all you can think about
Is letting go
Be true to yourself my love
That's all I ever wanted you to be
Just don't forget to smile
When you think of me
I'll reach for the stars
I've got them in sight
There's someone who really needs me

Out there in the night
We live for the future
We learn from the past
No matter how hard we try
Some good things never last
