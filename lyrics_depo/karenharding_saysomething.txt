Lately you've been quiet
Is there something on your mind, baby?
The suspense is killing me
So much that it's driving me crazy
The three words in your head
Drift ahead like they're gonna come save me
Oh, lately you've been quiet
Is there something on your mind, baby?

Baby, if you wanna say something, say it now
Cause I ain't got the time to be waiting around
Come on, tell me what you're feeling, use your mouth
If you wanna say something, say it now

You've been going out
Without doubt, what's going on baby?
I can see it in your eyes
Far behind and it's driving me crazy
Just tell me where you go
Cause I really need to know, please tell me
I'm so tired every day
Listening to the little that you're saying (that you say to me)

Baby, if you wanna say something, say it now
Cause I ain't got the time to be waiting around
Come on, tell me what you're feeling, use your mouth
If you wanna say something, say it now

Baby, if you wanna say something, say it now
Cause I ain't got the time to be waiting around
Come on, tell me what you're feeling, use your mouth
If you wanna say something, say it now

Oh, come on, tell me
Oh, come on, tell me
Oh, come on, tell me
Oh, say it now

Oh, come on, tell me
Oh, come on, tell me
Oh, come on, tell me
Oh, say it now

Oh, say something to me
Say something

Say it now
Waiting around
Use your mouth
Say it now

Baby, if you wanna say something, say it now
Cause I ain't got the time to be waiting around
Come on, tell me what you're feeling, use your mouth
If you wanna say something, say it now

Baby, if you wanna say something, say it now
Cause I ain't got the time to be waiting around
Come on, tell me what you're feeling, use your mouth
If you wanna say something, say it now

Oh, come on, tell me
Oh, come on, tell me
Oh, come on, tell me
Oh, say it now

Oh, come on, tell me
Oh, come on, tell me
Oh, come on, tell me
Oh, say it now
