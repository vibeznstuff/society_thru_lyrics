I never want to play the games that people play
I never want to hear the things they gotta say
I've found everything I need
I never wanted anymore than I can see
I only want you to believe



If it's wrong to tell the truth
Then what am I supposed to do
When all I want to do is speak my mind (speak my mind) - 
If it's wrong to do what's right
I'm prepared to testify
If loving you with all my heart's a crime - 
Then I'm guilty



I wanna give you all the things you never had
Don't try to tell me how he treats you isn't bad
I need you back in my life
I never wanted just to be the other guy (be the other guy - )
I never wanted to live a lie



If it's wrong to tell the truth
What am I supposed to do
All I want to do is speak my mind (speak my mind) - 
If it's wrong to do what's right
I'm prepared to testify
If loving you with all my heart's a crime - 
Then I'm guilty



Girl I followed my heart
Followed the truth
Right from the start it led me to you
Please don't leave me this way
I'm guilty now all I have to say 



If it's wrong to tell the truth
Then what am I supposed to do
When all I want to do is speak my mind (speak my mind) - 
If it's wrong to do what's right
I'm prepared to testify
If loving you with all my hearts a crime - 
Then I'm guilty


What am I supposed to do 
Then I'm guilty 
All I wanna do is speak my mind 
Guilty 
Then I'm guilty 
I'm prepared to testify 
If it's wrong to do what's right then tell me about this feeling inside 
If loving you with all my hearts a crime 
I'm Guilty
