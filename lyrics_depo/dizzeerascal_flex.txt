I wanna see you dip dip dip
And let me see you rock rock rock
I wanna ?
And never ever stop stop stop

I wanna see you dip dip dip
And let me see you rock rock rock
I wanna ?
And never ever stop stop stop

I love it when you flex like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back
I love it when you move like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back
I love it when you wind like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back

I love it when I see a pretty girl grinding
I can never watch a butters girl grindin'
Control the body with great timing.
?
Drop it like its hot you got my tings rising
So frequent, theres no disguising
Whatdo expect, that aint surprising
These girls get the blood pressure raising
The wiggling the jiggling
