Expectations and possibilities 
Don't need no crystalball across the probability 
I plan to take you home, do what you do to me 
Come be my roller-coaster, got you where we supposed to be 

Watch out 
I'm digging 
Why don't give it a try?
Deep down 
Can you feel it? 
You know I've been right 
Better hold tight 
We gone turn it round 
And around
And around
And around
And around
