Oh here it comes again 
That funny feelin again winding me up inside 
Every time we touch 
Hey I don't know 
Just tell me where to begin cause I never ever 
Felt so much 


No I can't recall any love at all 
Baby this blows 'em all away 


It's got what it takes 
So tell me why can't this be love 
Straight from my heart oh tell me why 
Can't this be love 
I tell myself 
Hey only fools rush in an only time will tell 
If we stand the test of time 
All I know 
You've got to run to win an I'll be damned if 
I'll get hung up on the line 









Tell me why can't this be love 
Baby why can't this be love 
Got to know why can't this be love 
I wanna know why can't this be love
