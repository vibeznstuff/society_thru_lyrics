World turns black and white 
Pictures in an empty room 
Your love starts fallin down 
Better change your tune 
Reach for the golden ring 
Reach for the sky 
Baby just spread your wings 


We'll get higher and higher straight up we'll climb 
We'll get higher and higher leave it all behind 
Run, run, run, away 
Like a train runnin off the track 
The truth gets left behind 
And falls between the cracks 
Standing on broken dreams 
But never losing sight 
Spread your wings 



So baby dry your eyes, save all the tears you've cried 
Ohh that's what dreams are made of 
Oh baby we belong in a world that must be strong 
Ohh that's what dreams are made of 





Higher and higher who knows what we'll find 
And in the end on dreams we will depend 
Cause thats what love is made of
