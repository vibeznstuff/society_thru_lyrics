Children, I know
You deserve more than this world could ever give
Children, I know
You deserve more than this world could ever give...

Hold on take your life
Hold on to each reality
They seem so far from you
But really they're close to you
You've got to break each precious dream
Until it breaks you heart in two
Build your life until you find
What's right for you

Children, I know
You deserve more than this world could ever give

Don't let them take it all
'Cause you know, they're going to take it all
They seem so far from you
But really they're close to you
You've got to break each precious dream
Until it breaks your heart in two
Build your life, until you find
What's right for you

Children, I know
You deserve more than this world could ever give...

(Long live the new flesh!)
