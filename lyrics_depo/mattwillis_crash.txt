Here you go way too fast 
Don't slow down you're gonna crash 
You should watch - watch your stay here 
Don't look out you're gonna break your neck 

So shut, shut your mouth 
Cos I'm not listening anyhow 
I've had enough, enough of you 
Enough to last a life time through 
So what - what do you want from me? 
Got no words of sympathy and if i go around with you 
You know that i'll get messed up too with you 
With you 

Na na na na na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na na na na na 

Here you go way too fast 
Don't slow down you're gonna crash 
You don't know what's been going down 
You've been running all over town 

So shut, shut your mouth 
Cos i'm not listening anyhow 
I've had enough, enough of you 
Enough to last a life time through 
So what - what do you want from me? 
Got no cure for misery and if I go around with you 
You know that i'll get messed up too with you! 
With you! 
With you! 
With you! 

Na na na na na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na na na na na 

You, with you, with you 
Na na na na na na na na na na na 
Don't slow down you're gonna crash 
Na na na na na na na na na na na 
Don't Slow down you're gonna crash 
Na na na na na na na na na na na 
Don't slow down you're gonna crash 
Na na na na na na na na na na na 
Don't slow down you're gonna crash 
Na na na na na na na na na na na 
Don't slow down you're gonna crash 
Na na na na na na na na na na na 
Don't slow down you're gonna crash...
