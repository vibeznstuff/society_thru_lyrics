Pour out your heart in 3:20
The one you didn't write for the money
You turn it in, nobody's listening
But you got a cut, so the check's coming
If it ain't a single, it don't mean nothing
But every girl with a dream wants to be your friend

One day, you're the king, and the next, you're not
It's handshakes and whiskey shots, boy
And throwing up in parking lots all by yourself

But I ain't never leaving Nashville
I ain't never leaving Nashville

You're getting calls from old friends
They say, "Heard your song - wanna write again?"
You're coming up with brand new ways to say no
Then you're six months without a hold
Every other day, you're getting canceled
Calling up old friends; that's just the way it goes

One day, you're the king, the next you're not
Handshakes and whiskey shots
And throwing up in parking lots all gone to Hell

Hell, I ain't never leaving Nashville
I ain't never leaving Nashville

Oh, and your friends are friends with country stars
Yeah, they're buying homes and here you are
You're two months from living in your car

But you ain't never leaving Nashville
You ain't never leaving Nashville

Oh, one day, you're the king, and the next you're not
It's handshakes and whiskey shots, boy
To picking up the pieces you lost of yourself

Well, I ain't never leaving Nashville
I ain't never leaving Nashville
I ain't never leaving Nashville
I ain't never leaving Nashville
I ain't never leaving this town, oh

One day you're the king, and the next you're not
