Come on baby and be my guest
Come join the party and meet the rest
Everything is gonna be alright
So be my guest tonight!

We're gonna dance to the rock an roll
We're gonna even do the stroll
We're gonna lindy hop with Suzy Q
It's a special party just for you

My, my oh my, gee, you so fine
Don't let me down
I'm the king but you can wear my crown
I'm gonna sing, my band gonna play

I'm gonna make you 'Queen For A Day'
Everythings gonna be alright
So be my guest tonight!

My, my oh my, gee, you so fine
