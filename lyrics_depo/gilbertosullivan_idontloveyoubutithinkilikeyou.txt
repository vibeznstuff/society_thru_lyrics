I don't love you but I think I like you
Think I like you and I think you know
I don't want you but I do desire you
Do desire you and I won't let go

You say you love me, I say you do
You say believe me I say it's true
If there's a question you'd like to make
It really depends on how much it weighs

I don't love you but I think I like you
Think I like you and I think you know
I don't want you but I do desire you
Do desire you and I won't let go

We are the champions, we are the few
We stick together all the way through
We don't like people telling us off
Hand on your mouth boy when you cough
Hand on your mouth boy when you cough

I don't love you but I think I like you
Think I like you and I think you know
I don't want you but I do desire you
Do desire you and I won't let go

I'll be your hinges, you be my door
You'll beg your pardon, I'll beg for more
If there's a knock then you're on your own
Tell them you're sorry, but no one's home
Tell them you're sorry, but no one's home

I don't love you but I think I like you
Think I like you and I think you know
I don't want you but I do desire you
Do desire you and I won't let go

I don't love you but I think I like you
Think I like you and I think you know
I don't want you but I do desire you
Do desire you and I won't let go
