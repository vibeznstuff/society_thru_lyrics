Hey, ey, ey
Whoa, oh, owoh

I saw you in the club
With your boys you were looking rough
You're making contact to me
I'm living in a dream, this isn't make believe
I want you to know

I won't let go
My body shows
You're everything I need
Won't you stay mine
From dawn till night
To live our fantasy

(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)
I'm in love

(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)
(I wanna do it)

(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)
I'm in love, I wanna do it

Let step into your ride
Can we drive into the night?
So it's just you and me
I step into your light
See that it shines bright
We're meant to be

I won't let go
My body shows
You're everything I need
Won't you stay mine
From dawn till night
To live our fantasy

(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)
I'm in love

(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)
(I wanna do it)

(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)
'Cause I'm in love
(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)
(i wanna do it)

So you left me in
And our love will shine
I will always be yours
And you'll always be mine

(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)

(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)
I wanna do it

I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)

'Cause I'm in love
(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)
(I wanna do it)
