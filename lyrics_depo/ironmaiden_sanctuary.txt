Out of winter came a warhorse of steel
I've never killed a woman before
But I know how it feels
I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law

I met up with a stranger last night
To keep me alive
He spends all his money on gambling
And guns to survive
I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for Sanctuary from the law


So give me Sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me Sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight...tonight

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for Sanctuary from the law



I can laugh at the wind
I can howl at the rain
Down in the canyon or out on the plains

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for Sanctuary from the law
