The morning paper
Look in the mirror
On your key-chain
Or in the coffee spoon
On your shirt sleeve
In the flat-screen
In your mailbox
Breathing over you

Come on baby, when will you see
That you and I were meant to be
And now I got my target on track
Baby you should know that I'm so good at that

Run to where you want, run to where you want
I am gonna find you
There ain't no distance far enough
My love's gonna find you

Run to where you want, run to where you want
But may I remind you
There ain't no engine fast enough
My love's gonna catch you

In your top drawer
In your cheque book
On your cellphone
By your easy-chair
In the next room
Behind the curtain
Can't escape me
I'm watching everywhere

Come on baby, when will you see
That you and I were meant to be
And know I got my target, I'm on track
Baby you should know that I'm so good at that

Run to where you want
Run to where you want
I am gonna find you
There ain't no distance far enough
My love's gonna find you

Run to where you want, run to where you want
But may I remind you
There ain't no engine fast enough
My love's gonna catch you

Why waste your energy
No point in fighting
Let you heart surrender to your destiny

And this world's not big enough
For you to hide for long
In this game of hide and seek
There's nowhere left to run

Run to where you want, run to where you want
I am gonna find you
There ain't no distance far enough
My love's gonna find you

Run to where you want, run to where you want
But may I remind you
There ain't no engine fast enough
My love's gonna catch you

Catch you, catch you, catch you, catch you, catch you, catch you, catch you, catch you
