Since you're gone 
The nights are gettin' strange 
Since you're gone 
Well, nothing's makin' any sense 
Since you're gone 
I stumbled in the shade 
Since you're gone 
Everything's in perfect tense, well

I can't help it 
When you fall apart 
I (and I) can't help it 
Guess you better start 

That is forgettin' about you 
(Since you're gone) 
Since you're gone 
Nights are gettin' strange 
(Since you're gone) 
Since you're gone 
Thrownin' it all away 
(Since you're gone) 
Since you're gone 
The nights are gettin' strange 
(Since you're gone) 
Since you're gone 
Thrownin' it all away 

I can't help it 
Everything's a mess 
I can't help it 
You're so treacherous 
When it comes, to tenderness 
(Since you're gone) 
I can't help it 
Everything's a mess 
I can't help it 
You're so treacherous 
Oh, where's that tenderness? 
(Since you're gone) 

Since you're gone 
I missed the peak sensation 
(Since you're gone) 
Since you're gone 
I took the big vacation 
(Since you're gone) 
Well, never feel sedate 
(Since you're gone) 
Well, the moonlight ain't so great 
(Since you're gone) 

Since you're gone 
(Since you're gone) 
Well, I've thrown it all away 
(Since you're gone) 
When the night 
(Since you're gone) 
Strange I've thrown it all away 
(Since you're gone) 
Well, since you're gone 
(Since you're gone)

Since you're gone 
Since you're gone 
(Since you're gone) 
I've thrown it all away 
(Since you're gone)
