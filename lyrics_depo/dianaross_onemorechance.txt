Feel like a fool
Not realizing all the value you had
I took a happy ending and made it sad
The day I walked away and left you alone
With hardly an explanation
You stood on your own
And handled the situation
And showed to me
How understanding you could be

Now I'm alone
Looking back at all the years that we shared
Thinking of the pain you should have been spared
Afraid to ask forgiveness
But where can I go
There's no one else to turn to
I still have my pride
But now its time to learn to cast it aside
And come to you with honesty

Give me just one more chance
Such a simple thing I'm asking for
Just one more chance
It would be a shame to close the door to
One more chance
Isn't that what we pray each night for?
One more chance
Isn't that what we're fighting for?
Why throw away a love that needs one more chance

Now I'm afraid that after all I've said
You'll still turn me down and you'll smile
And say I'll see you around
But remember that you still have a choice
And I hope and pray you'll make it
You'll think of my heart
And you won't wanna break it
And I'll prove to you the kind of lady I can be

Give me just one more chance
Such a simple thing I'm asking for
Just one more chance
It would be a shame to close the door to
One more chance
Isn't that what we pray each night for?
One more chance
Isn't that what we're fighting for?

One more chance
Don't you know that we belong together
One more chance
Now I really need you more than ever
One more chance
You and I can really make it baby
One more chance
All you have do is say the words to
One more chance
One more
One more chance
One more chance
