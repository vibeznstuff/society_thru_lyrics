To me where the wild things are is a place that exists is our minds
It's a place of liberty and shamelessness
It can take a split second or a lifetime to find it
But once you do, you'll be free

Find table spaces
Say your social graces
Bow your head, they're pious here
But you and I, we're pioneers
We make our own rules
Our own room, no bias here
Let 'em sell what they are sellin'
There are no buyers here

So gather all the rebels now
We'll rabble-rouse and sing aloud
We don't care what they say, no way, no way
And we will leave the empty
Chairs to those who say we can't sit there
We're fine all by ourselves

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks
If you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being

Find me where the wild things are
Oh, my, we'll be alright
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh, my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are

I lose my balance on these eggshells
You tell me to tread
I'd rather be a wild one instead
Don't wanna hang around the in crowd
The cool kids aren't cool to me
They're not cooler than we are

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks
If you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being

Find me where the wild things are
Oh, my, we'll be alright
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh, my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah

We will carve our place into time and space
We will find our way, or we'll make a way, say hey, hey, hey
Find you're great, don't you hide your face
And let it shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks
If you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being

Find me where the wild things are
Oh, my, we'll be alright
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh, my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are


There's a wild thing that exists in all of us
It lives in our passions, in the people we love, in our subconscious thoughts, our beliefs
It's even made a home in the darkest parts of us
But we can't be scared of it
We have to become it
