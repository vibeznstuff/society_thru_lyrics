Find the colour 
Sight and sound
A new exposure comes around
Anaesthetic for the mind
Hear the voice that soothes away the pain

Television, satellite,
Conversation running dry
Sending back another text
Holding on to words you might regret
You know you might regret


Cause now i can see that i love all the things
That you do with each day
And it feels, so damn good
Every second that passes me by With the blink of an eye
It just feels, so damn good
Find the colour, find the colour

Looking for something new
A taste of life to pull you through
Defences down your feeling low
A change in feeling comes around again
Its coming round again


So damn good

I read the papers yesterday
They say that the bubble boy's ok
Another day of rain to come
We're sitting back still waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
