Steam 

Call me for the pleasure
You can call me for the pain
Call me on the phone
Or on the mental plane
I'll be the freak you need
I contain what U came 4
Come without Karma
To destruct the dancefloor
Rise to the top, never stop
Drop like cream
U bring the body and
I'll bring the steam

Love can love you
Love can heal you
Love can see you
Love can feel you
Love can warm you (oh babe)
Love can calm you
Love will help you
Love won't harm you

Steam, steam
There's no need to be afraid
Steam, steam
Let the lake of love flow
Steam, steam
2 night let's become one soul

Steam, 

Steam, like a cream dream
Never stop rising
I'll rub you like a wave
Going out while the tides in
Precious bubbilicious
Hard or nice n' easy
Smooth with the move to sooth
Dry or greasy
Here is your harmony
Here is your friend
Kindred spirit of ethereal blend
Meet me on a cloud
Go on a journey, sure
I'll take your body on a mystery tour

The clock upon your wall
Is tickin' slower and slower
Time disappears as I go
lower and lower
I know your final fantasy
But I can't repeat that
Doubting about me
Bet you doubt, I'll defeat that
I'm your spiritual dancer
Your emotion enhancer
Anyway you wanna go
Whether below or on top
I'll love you down
All around in and out and all about
I got your drinkable water
I'm your lover non stop

Outside it's raining but inside is wet
