Baby Baby, feel these sweet sensations, yeah
Honey honey, looks like a superstar
She's got a promise of love struck fascination
What am I to do? How am I to know?
Who you are

She shimmers like a California sunset
Lady lady, glitters but theres no gold
She carries sweetly infectious magic formulas
I'm so delirious, is she that serious?
Is she bringing me on, I've been waiting so long

And this love, Fool, osophy is killing
Previous illusions that
I had in my mind about you
Seems so true, all the lies you're telling
Tragically compelling and
My love it means nothing to you
So maybe I'm still a love Fool

I don't want to be a love Fool
I don't want the world I want you
But don't let me be your love Fool
