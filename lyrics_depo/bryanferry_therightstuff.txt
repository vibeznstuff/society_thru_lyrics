Got your money on the table and the devil in your eye
Who is that woman with the crooked smile?
You got to go with what you feel
A little loving is a dangerous thing
Black is the ocean, a burning sky

Her nature's wild
It's hard to beat the right stuff
It's mountain high, river deep
The right stuff

Got your pearls on a string and your skin's so bare
Over your shoulder there's a world out there
You got the nerve, you gonna win
Boy, you're playing with a dangerous thing

Her nature's wild
It's hard to beat the right stuff
It's mountain high, river deep
The right stuff

So it goes without saying she's the queen of the Nile
Lion woman with the crooked smile
You got the nerve, who's gonna win?
Boy, you're playing with a dangerous thing

Her nature's wild
It's hard to beat the right stuff
It's mountain high, river deep
The right stuff

Send me the woman on a bended knee
Emerald eyes in desert heat

She's mountain high, river deep
The right stuff

Right stuff (Right stuff)
Right stuff (Right stuff)
(Right stuff)

Send me the woman to fight for me
Nature's wild, hard to beat

She's mountain high, river deep
The right stuff

(Right stuff)
(Right stuff)
(Right stuff)
(Right stuff)

(Right stuff)
(Right stuff)
