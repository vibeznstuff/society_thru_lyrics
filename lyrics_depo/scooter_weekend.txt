Sounds of the track attacker!
Go ahead!
Yes!
Here comes the chicks; terminator!
In control!
Argh!
'Pon the mic I'm the teacher!
Spead my words like a preacher!
Cut the crap! Get the slap!
Drum 'n' Bass still on the map!
'Pon the mic you can't stop me!
Flat on your back like one, two, three! Yeah!
Here we come!

Love in a woman's heart
I want it at the whole and not a part
Strange that this feeling grows more and more
'Cause I've never loved someone like you before

All right!

Love in a woman's heart
I want it at the whole and not a part
Strange that this feeling grows more and more
'Cause I've never loved someone like you before

Bass drum!

Love in a woman's heart
I want it at the whole and not a part
Strange that this feeling grows more and more
'Cause I've never loved someone like you before

Yeah!

Ahh!

All right, crew! 
It's weekend!
Yes!
We are not the monkeys, but we've got the key!
I'm the fast chatter - no one's better then me!
Yeah!
'Pon the mic I'm the teacher!
Spead my words like a preacher!
Cut the crap! Get the slap!
Drum 'n' Bass's still on the map!
'Pon the mic I'm the Voodoo!
Destination of Zulu
Here we come! Here we go!

Love in a woman's heart
I want it at the whole and not a part
Strange that this feeling grows more and more
'Cause I've never loved someone like you before

Yeah!

Love in a woman's heart
I want it at the whole and not a part
Strange that this feeling grows more and more
'Cause I've never loved someone like you before

C'mon!

What is essential? It's invisible to the eye!
It's only with the heart, that you can see rightly

Yeah!

Love in a woman's heart
I want it at the whole and not a part
Strange that this feeling grows more and more
'Cause I've never loved someone like you before

Chilly bow!
Yeah!
Respect to the man in the ice cream van!

Over and out!
