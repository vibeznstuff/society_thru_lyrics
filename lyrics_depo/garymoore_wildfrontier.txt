I remember the old country
They call the emerald land
And I remember my hometown
Before the war began

Now we're riding on a sea of rage
The victims you have seen
You'll never hear them sing again
The Forty Shades Of Green

We're goin' back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling
Back to the wild frontier
We're goin' back
Back to the wild frontier

I remember my city streets
Before the soldiers came
Now armoured cars and barricades
Remind us of our shame

We are drowning in a sea of blood
The victims you have seen
Never more to sing again
The Forty Shades Of Green

We're goin' back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling
Back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling

Those are the days I will remember
Those are the days I most recall
We count the cost of those
