Drawer back the curtain,
Let the sun stream in.
So tell me a story,
When you're ready, begin.

Speak of the peaceful,
The gracious, the wise.
Let the world hear our laughter,
Before it dies.

With a beginning,
There must be an end.
What is the truth of that my friend.
From the sound of the joyous,

The gentle, the mild.
Please look out at life,
With the eyes of a child.
From the eyes of a child,

Keep out darkness and let in light.
Let the eyes of a child,
See little things that will give him peace,
And fill his life.

Short is the memory,
But long is the hate.
For peace on the earth,
How long must we wait?

Think of the colours,
The seasons, the sun.
Put an end to the sorrows,
That we have begun.

From the eyes of a child,
Keep out darkness and let in light.
Let the eyes of a child,
See little things that will give him peace,

And fill his life.
Drawer back the curtain,
The stage is all set.
And start on a story,

We'll never forget.
Tell all the hopeful,
The loving, the mild.
Then look out at life,

With the eyes of a child.
