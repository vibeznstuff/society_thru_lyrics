I saw you there
I stopped and stared
the curly girlie smiled
You really were
too close to her
and people just went by

I saw your face
and her embrace
your whisper in her ear
I know the score
'cause I've heard it before
I read your lips with fear

Your words were clear (you said:)

La-la-la-la-la-la
let's say forever, let's say it's true
la-la-la-la-la-la-
let's come together, me and you
la-la-la-la-la-la
your new cuckoo
