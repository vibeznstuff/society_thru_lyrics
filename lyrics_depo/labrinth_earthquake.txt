Labrinth, come in...

Ladies and gentlemen
This is something they call
A ground-breaker, breaker...
So let me first apologize
To the shirts and the ties
For your makeup

Cause I'll make you ugly
As soon as it drops
We're on a rampage
Bottles poppin' off
Before you know it
There's rubble and dust
Cause we be crashing it up
Somebody say, "You better run"

Yeah!
I predict an earthquake up in here
Say yeah!
I predict an earthquake up in here
Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
Just smash something, yeah mosh for me
Hey yeah!
We can make an earthquake up in here
So here we go, we go

Ladies and gentlemen
What you're about to witness
Is no illusion...
And now, we got the bass banging from here to Buckingham Palace
They're all moving
Hey Simon, we're fucking them up
Turning them Syco 
Everybody rock
Let's bring the house down to rubble and dust
Cause we be crashing it up
Somebody say, "You better run"

Yeah!
I predict an earthquake up in here
Say yeah!
I predict an earthquake up in here
Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
Just smash something, yeah mosh for me
Hey yeah!
We can make an earthquake up in here
So here we go, we go

I predict an earthquake up in here... 
Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
Just smash something, yes mosh for me, hey yes
We can make an earthquake up in here
So here we go, we go


Hey, yo Labrinth, this one's feeling like a straight 10 on the Richter scale, you know
Yeah, fire, fire
We about to set this place on fire
Without a match or lighter
Don't do girlfriends
One nighters make them, ah
C-minor, if I want Christian or Kurt Geiger
I just phone up the designer
Doing all-nighters
No days off, grey hairs and a little bit of weight loss
I predict riots, I predict chaos
I predict evil, I predict aaahh!
Disturbing London, got the whole city panicking
I'll be Nostradamus, this my nig-nig-nig-nig Labrinth

Yeah!
I predict an earthquake up in here
Say yeah!
I predict an earthquake up in here
Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
Just smash something, yeah mosh for me
Hey yeah!
We can make an earthquake up in here
So here we go, we go

Labrinth, come in...
