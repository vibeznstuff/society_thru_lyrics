The minute you walked in the joint,
I could see you were a man of distinction,
A real  Big  Spender,
Good looking, so refined.
Say, wouldn't you like to know what's going on in my mind?

So let me get right to the point,
I don't pop my cork for every man I see.
HEY  Big  Spender,
Spend a little time with me.

Wouldn't you like to have fun? Fun? Fun?
How's  about a few  laughs? Laughs?
I can show you a good time,
Let me show you a good time.
