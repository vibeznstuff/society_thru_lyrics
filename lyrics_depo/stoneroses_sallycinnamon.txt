Until Sally I was never happy
I needed so much more
Rain clouds oh, they used to chase me
Down they would pour
Join my tears 
Allay my fears

Sent to me from heaven
Sally Cinnamon you're my world

Pop, pop, pop, blow, blow bubble gum
You taste of cherryade 
There is something hey you must show me
From what you are made

Sugar and spice 
And all things nice

Sent to me from heaven
Sally Cinnamon you're my world
You are my world

Your eyes are gazing back 
From every little piece of glass
You seem to smile from every blade 
Sally Cinnamon you are my world

Then I put the letter back
In the place where it was found
In the pocket of a jacket
On a train in town

Sent to her from heaven
Sally Cinnamon you're her world
