Freedom's just a word today 
Freedom's just a word 
When someone takes your word away it's seldom ever heard 
So take a sentence full of things you're not supposed to say 
Carry on, but don't write it down or you'll be gone 

Love is just a song today 
Love is just a song 
When someone takes the song away 
you seldom sing along 
So take those lyrics serious and sing your life away 
Carry on, but don't write 'em down or they'll be gone 

All we ever do is talk 
We like to ride but we never walk 
We make it so damn easy 
We get bored 
Why can't anybody see what's good for you is good for me 
I can't take your sillyworld 
I can't take your sillyworld no more 

Peace is just two fingers now 
Peace was just a phase 
When someone put it on a shirt 
you knew to count the days 
So take those fingers tape 'em up and shove 'em up your ass and carry on
but don't try it now cause peace is gone 

All we ever do is talk 
We like to ride but we never walk 
We make it so damn easy 
We get bored 
Why can't anybody see what's good for you is bad for me 
I can't take your sillyworld 
I can't take your sillyworld no more 

We fight our instincts 
We go to extremes 
We fight our instincts 
We go to extremes 

We fought a lot
