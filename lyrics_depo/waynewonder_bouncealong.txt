Baby... Oh...
Beautiful girl and that's for sure
The way she make love me haffi regress small
She gave me even on the wooden floor
Says she wants a man like me in her life
No problem me say me bounce alright
She talk about her it each and every night...
I don't wanna talk about
What I had before
So what I wanna do right now
Is give you love galore
Baby...


Bounce along, bounce along
Only you can turn me on
Bounce along, bounce along
Bounce along, bounce along
Only you can turn me on
Bounce along, bounce along


Maybe all I believe is what seen in you
Loving every single thing you do
Clearly I can see you want me too
Lately I've been talking to my self
Saying I don't need nobody else
Cause all I'm searching for I found in you
I don't wanna sleep alone
Without you in my bed
Cause when you're not around my love
It's messing up me head
Baby...


Bounce along, bounce along
Only you can turn me on
Bounce along, bounce along
Bounce along, bounce along
Only you can turn me on
Bounce along, bounce along
