What do I have to do
To get you where
I want you

I'll guess we'll see
What might be, whoa

You're a million miles
A million miles away
So come closer
So come closer
So come closer
Whoa, whoa

You're reasons, don't make any sense
I'll never rely on you
And you're draped on him
While you're staring at me
Whoa, whoa

You're a million miles
A million miles away
So come closer
So come closer
So come closer
Whoa, ahh, ah

You're a million miles
A million miles away
So come closer
So come closer
Whoa, ahh, ah
