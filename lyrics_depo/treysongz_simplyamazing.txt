I can't really explain what it is she does
But um, whatever it is
It's um, simply, simply amazing

Her head is on my chest, sun comes rolling in
We're lost in these covers, and all I feel is skin
I slowly kiss your face, beautiful in every way, you are (you are)

See I'm a man that don't believe in much
But I'll be damned, if I don't believe in us
And how we play a fight up in the bathroom
Next thing you know I'm making love to you
Girl, promise me you'll never change

She ain't perfect, but she's worth it
Every breath I breathe, for the life of me
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me, and it's simply amazing (you are),
Simply amazing (you are), simply amazing (you are)
And she loves me, and it's simply amazing, amaze-amazing

The girl's a work of art, and I can't help but stare
With a smile like the sunset, and the ocean is her hair
Ooohhh what she do ain't fair ooooohhh
She know me better, than I know myself, mhmmm

See I'm a man, that don't believe in much
But I'll be damned if I don't believe in us
Like when I said I loved you for the first time
And the tears dropped from your eyes
Girl, don't you ever change

Cause she ain't perfect, but she's worth it
Every breath I breathe for the life of me
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me, and it's simply amazing (you are)
Simply amazing (you are), simply amazing (you are)
And she loves me

There is nothing, in this world
That can keep me away from you
And there's nobody who could ever compare to you
Ooohhhhh

She ain't perfect (no she ain't), but she's worth it (I'm telling you she is)
Every breath I breathe, for the life of me
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me and it's simply amazing (you are)
Simply amazing (you are), simply amazing (you are)
And she loves me, and it's simply amazing
