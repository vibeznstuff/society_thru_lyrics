Truck on Truck on Truck on Truck on Tyke
Oh Tyke baby
You're a slender living lady
You're dynamite
You're a jeep mouth dancer
You're a right on dancer
You got gangster's legs
Like a song I truck on
You're a silver-stud fender
I'm a jive brain bender I'm everyone
Got electric deep in me
I'm a space age cowboy
Ride dinosaurs
Like a song I truck on
Oh Tyke baby
You're a palamino baby
'Cos you move along
People put you down
'Cos you're too low on the ground
They can't hurt though
'Cos you're cosmic
