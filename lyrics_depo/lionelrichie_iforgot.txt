Well honey here I am
I'm standing here all alone
Trying to get back to you
I know I did you wrong
By walking away
But now I need to tell you
I know now
What we had was a good thing
I know now
How much I'm lost
Girl without you
Without you

I forgot it was your love
That captured my mind
I forgot it was your dreams
That turned my life around
I forgot it was your world
I wanted to see
I forgot it was my wish
To make it you and me

Tell me what do I do
I'm going out of my head
I want and I'm missing you
I can't believe where I am
What have I done to myself
Girl I didn't mean to hurt us
I see now
That your love was all I needed
I see now
How much I was wrong
So forgive me, so forgive me
Forgive me

I forgot it was your love
That captured my mind
I forgot it was your dreams 
That turned my life around
I forgot it was your world
I wanted to see
I forgot it was my wish
To make it you and me

Tell me what do I do
I'm going out of my head
I'm wanting and missing you
I can't believe where I am
What have I done to myself
I really didn't mean to hurt us
I see now I didn't have to play the game
That I was playing
I see now
That I was wrong so wrong
Can you hear me
Please forgive me

I forgot it was your love
That captured my mind
I forgot it was your dreams
That turned my life around
I forgot it was your world
I wanted to see
I forgot it was my wish
To make it you and me

I forgot about you
I forgot about me
I forgot about all the things we wanted together
I forgot about the dreams
Oh how much I love you babe
I forgot...
