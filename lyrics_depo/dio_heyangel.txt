How do you feel right now
How does it feel to be alone
How do you feel right now
Tell me

Hey angel - what's your situation
Hey angel - oh, oh

Where would you be right now
Waiting to taste your next tomorrow
Where would you be right now
Tell me

Was the pain too strong to take it anymore
So you turned off all the lights and shut the door

Hey angel - what's your destination
Hey angel
Hey angel - we got a complication
Hey angel - oh, oh - you're my angel, my angel

How do you feel right now
How does it feel to be alone, oh
How do you feel right now
How do you feel right now

Oh angel - you're my angel, oh my angel,...
