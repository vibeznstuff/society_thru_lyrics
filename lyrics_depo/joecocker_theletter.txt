give me a ticket for an airoplane
i ain't got time to take no fast train
oh ,the lonely days are gone
i'll be right home
my baby she wrote me a letter

i don't care how much money i got to spend
i won't find my way home again
oh the lonely days are gone
i'll be right home
my baby, she wrote me a letter

she wrote me a letter
said she couldn't live with out me no more
listen to me mister don't you ever xxxx
my baby once more
anyway

give me a ticket for an airoplane
i ain't got time to take no fast train
oh ,the lonely days are gone
i'll be back home
my baby she wrote me a letter
