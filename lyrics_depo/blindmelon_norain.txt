All I can say
Is that my life is pretty plain
I like watchin' the puddles gather rain
And all I can do
Is just pour some tea for two
And speak my point of view
But it's not sane,
It's not sane

I just want some one to say to me,
"I'll always be there when you wake."
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
So stay with me and I'll have it made

And I don't understand why I sleep all day
And I start to complain
That there's no rain
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
And it rips my life away,
But it's a great escape
Escape... escape... escape...

All I can say
Is that my life is pretty plain
You don't like my point of view
You think that I'm insane
It's not sane... it's not sane.

I just want some one to say to me,
"I'll always be there when you wake."
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
So stay with me and I'll have it made

And I'll have it made
And I'll have it made
And I'll have it made oh no no no
You know I'm really gonna
Really gonna
Have it made
And I'll have it made
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
