I see you every day walking down the avenue
I'd like to get to know you but all I do is smile at you.
Oh baby, when it comes to talking my tongue gets so tight
This sidewalk love affair has got me high as a kite
Yeah yeah, there's something 'bout you baby I like

Well I'm a slow walker but girl I'd race a mile for you
Just to get back in time for my peek-a-boo rendezvous
Well baby maybe it's the way you wear your blue jeans so tight
I can't put my finger on what you're doing right
Yeah yeah, there's something 'bout you baby I like

Yeah yeah, there's something 'bout you baby I like

Well I'm standing on a corner smiling by a telephone
I'd like to check you over, get to know you with a fine tooth comb
Oh baby, when I get home I turn out the light
And then you come a strolling through my dreams every night
Yeah yeah, there's something 'bout you baby I like
Yeah yeah, there's something 'bout you baby I like
