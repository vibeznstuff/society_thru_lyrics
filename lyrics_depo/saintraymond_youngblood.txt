I'm not saying it's nothing, but we don't need to hold hands,
You could get away so easily.
In the light of the day it's a problem, by the night we're away.
In the heart of it all there's a truth I know.

If you like, if you like, I could mean it.
If you like we could try, we could try
We can make it if you try.
If you like, if you like, I could mean it
If you like, give me time, give me time, I could be here by your side.

You're the ones who hold me down
You could be the ones who show me how.
You could turn this heart around
If you gonna tell me, tell me now.
Singin':
Young blood, we can't help what we're feeling
Young blood, we can't help what we're feeling.

I don't know where we're headin' but I just need a sign
I don't want to be left here on my own.
You're the piece of a puzzle I can't seem to place.
In the heart of it all there's a truth I know.

If you like, if you like, I could mean it.
If you like we could try, we could try
We can make it if you try.
If you like, if you like, I could mean it
If you like, give me time, give me time, I could be here by your side.

You're the ones who hold me down
You could be the ones who show me how.
You could turn this heart around
If you gonna tell me, tell me now.
Singin':
Young blood, we can't help what we're feeling
Young blood, we can't help what we're feeling.

I don't know what we'll find
I know that we'll find young blood, young blood.
I don't know what we'll find
But we'll see in time, you know, you know.

Young blood, we can't help what we're feeling
Young blood, we can't help what we're feeling
Young blood, we can't help what we're feeling
Young blood, we can't help what we're feeling

You're the ones who hold me down
You could be the ones who show me how.
You could turn this heart around
If you gonna tell me, tell me now.
Singin':
Young blood, we can't help what we're feeling
Young blood, we can't help what we're feeling.

You're the ones who hold me down
You could be the ones who show me how.
You could turn this heart around
If you gonna tell me, tell me now.
Singin':
Young blood, we can't help what we're feeling
Young blood, we can't help what we're feeling.
