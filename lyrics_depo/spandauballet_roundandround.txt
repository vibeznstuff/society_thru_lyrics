I don't have to be so wise
You're just my fantasy and I will fantasize
Something more or less to make this things started
We're the artisans and we've been crafted

I wanna be your magical mystery
I wanna be your final history
This is the news

Nothing's ever been so wild
All that I get to do is what I give to you
This is all about the circles we've found
And through the ups and downs it goes round

Oh, I was just beginning to grow strong
She was only eighteen summers long
Oh, we were the news

Round and round it goes
And oh don't you know
This is the game that we came here for
Round and round it goes
And oh don't you know

Oh I don't have to be so wild
You're just my fantasy and I will fantasize
Something more or less to make this things started
We're the artisans and we've been crafted

I wanna be your magical mystery
I wanna be your final history
This is the news

Round and round it goes
And oh don't you know
Ooh, this is the game that we came here for
Round and round it goes
And oh don't you know
This is the game that we came here for

Round and round it goes
And oh don't you know
Ooh, this is the game that we came here for
Round and round it goes
And oh don't you know

You're just my fantasy and I will fantasize

I wanna be your magical mystery
I wanna be your final history
This is the news of my life

Oh I was just beginning to grow strong
She was only eighteen summers long
We were the news
We were the news
We were the news

Round and round it goes
And oh don't you know
This is the game that we came here for
Round and round it goes
And oh don't you know

Round and round it goes
And oh don't you know
Ooh, this is the game that we came here for
Round and round it goes
And oh don't you know
Round and round it goes
Round and round it goes
And oh don't you know
