Slow down, slow down
You'll only get burned out
Calm down, calm down
You're getting so worn out

They're trying to make you compromise
This fire burning in your eyes

Darling, you're slowly drifting out of reach
I'm slowly drifting out of reach
We're slowly drifting out of reach

You're slowly falling out of reach
I'm slowly falling out of reach
We're slowly falling out of reach

Out of reach

So home is just a word now
You don't see it anymore
The child's eyes are vacant now
The lights are just a glare

Music's gone and you're always wrong
And there's people everywhere

But darling, time will make amends
Just need a rest, just need your friends

They're slowly drifting out of reach
You're slowly drifting out of reach
We're slowly drifting out of reach

You're slowly falling out of reach
I'm slowly falling out of reach
We're slowly falling out of reach

Oh, keep falling, falling down
You won't need this
You don't need this now

You should be sleeping
Yeah, you should be sleeping

Oh, you're slowly drifting out of reach
I'm slowly drifting out of reach
We're slowly drifting out of reach

You're slowly falling out of reach
I'm slowly falling out of reach
We're slowly falling out of reach

Out of reach

Don't cry, don't cry
Birds' eyes fill up in the sky

The sun keeps burning
The sun keeps burning
Don't know what to do

Out of reach
