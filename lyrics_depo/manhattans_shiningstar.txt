Honey, you are my shining star
Don't you go away
Wanna be right here where you are
until my dying day 

So many have tried, tried to find
a love like yours and mine 

Girl, don't you realize
how you hypnotize?
Make me, love you more each time 

Honey I'll never leave you lonely
Give my love to you only
to you only, to you on - ly 

Honey, you are my shining star.
Don't you go away.
Wanna be right here where you are
until my dying day. 

Feels so good when we're lying here next to each other,
lost in love. 

Baby, when we touch, love you so much.
You're all I ever dreamed of. 

Honey I'll never leave you lonely;
give my love to you only,
to you only, to you only. 

Honey, you are my shining star.
Don't you go away.
Wanna be right here where you are
until my dying day
