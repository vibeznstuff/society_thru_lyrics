Hey! Hey! You! You!
I don't like your girlfriend!
No way! No way!
I think you need a new one
Hey! Hey! You! You!
I could be your girlfriend
Hey! Hey! You! You!
I know that you like me
No way! No way!
You know it's not a secret
Hey! Hey! You! You!
I want to be your girlfriend

You're so fine
I want you mine
You're so delicious
I think about you all the time
You're so addictive
Don't you know what I could do to make you feel alright (alright, alright, alright)?
Don't pretend. I think you know I'm damn precious
And—hell, yeah!—
I'm the motherfucking princess
I can tell you like me too, and you know I'm right (I'm right, I'm right, I'm right)

She's like so whatever
You could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that's what everyone's talking about!

No way! No way!
You know it's not a secret
Hey! Hey! You! You!
I want to be your girlfriend

I can see the way, I see the way you look at me
And even when you look away I know you think of me
I know you talk about me all the time again and again (again, again, again)
So, come over here, tell me what I want to hear
Better yet make your girlfriend disappear
I don't want to hear you say her name ever again (and again, and again, and again)

She's like so whatever
You could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that's what everyone's talking about!

In a second you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other
So, when's it gonna sink in?
She's so stupid
What the hell were you thinking?!
