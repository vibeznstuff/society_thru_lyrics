Touche D'amour
Yours is a sunny day
Of this I'm sure
Blowing my clouds away

I just don't know what this could do to me
I only want it to be
Touche D'amour
Touche D'amour
Sailing around the room like never before
Could never have come too soon
I want this dance to last forever
For it to last forever more
Touche D'amour
