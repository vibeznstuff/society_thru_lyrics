I've been there and seen it
I've been up and down
And I've been fighting for so long.

I can't stop for all your stories
I can't stop for all you young hearts.

Been up on the power
Been down and ashamed
I'm sure I'm guilty of something now.

I'm back and I'm proven
I'm back and I'm strong
And I've been waiting for so long.
