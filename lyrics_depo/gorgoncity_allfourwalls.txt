As the minutes turn to hours
With the fading of the daylight
And a heartbeat full of colour
Is turning into black and white

It's like every day
These four walls are closing in
On all you had, and all you hold
And all you love

But now all four walls are falling down
All four walls (all four walls)
Yeah, all four walls are falling down
All four walls (all four walls)

(All four walls)
(All four walls)

As the days all pull together
And are pale under fluorescent lights
All the ghosts I see before me
Leave me holding to the burning light

And in every way
These four walls are closing in
On all you had, and all you hold
And all you love

But now all four walls are falling down
All four walls (all four walls)
Yeah, all four walls are falling down
All four walls (all four walls)

All you have, all you hold
All you love (all four walls)
All you have, all you hold
All you hold, all you love
(All four walls)
All you have, all you hold
All you love (all four walls)
All you have, all you hold
All you hold, all you love

But now all four walls are falling down
All four walls (all four walls)
Yeah, all four walls are falling down
All four walls (all four walls)
All four walls are falling down
All four walls (all four walls)
Yeah, all four walls are falling down
All four walls (all four walls)
