"Serial slaughtering stranglers 
Jugging Juggling juggalos 
Folded, fat, floppy-tittied freaks 
I C fuckin P's in the haugh" 


Abracadabra boom shacka dae
I'm Violent J, and I'm back like a vertebrae 
And I come with a hat full of tricks 
Trunk full of Faygo, car full of fat chicks 
Hahahahahahahaha, fuck you 
Wicked clowns, we'd like to say what up to 
The Cobra's, X-men, and Counts, and everybody with clown luv 
Even sets I've never heard of 
Roll into town, and out with the big top 
Four cards down, and two more still to drop 
And when it does, I pack up and hit the road 
Cuz I don't wanna see your head explode 
Toss me an axe, and I'll toss you a dead chicken 
Add a buck, you get a two-liter with em 
And when the genie says on with the show
It's hokus pokus jokers, Great Milenko.


Once again, the psychotic carnival creatures in the haugh
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride
Southwest slithering snakes of darkness come
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride


Shazam BAM, shocka locka lokey
Shaggy the clown back like scoliosis 
Call me a psycho-skitso freak 
And I'll call you by your name (dick-anus) 
Cuz I can give two shits and a fuck 
I bounce down Verner in a popcorn clown truck 
I'm a circus ninja southwest voodoo wizard. 
I grab your gizzard 
Jump on the carpet, let's take a spin 
Everybody's waitin for the show to begin 
Up to the top, by the neck, and let you go 
Try to land in a glass of Faygo 
Uh, you suck, you missed the fuckin glass 
Broken neck, and busted your fuckin ass 
But the genie says on with the show 
Hokus Pokus Jokers, Great Milenko. 


What awaits you after death, rub the lamp and explore
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride
Enter Milenko's Fun House, walk right through the wretched hall
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride

"Fuck em all, fuck em all
Clown dawg, freak dawg
Joker dawg, Milenko dawg"

Fidgets of joker's cards blasting in your mother's face
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride


Rude Boy and Chucky down wit the clown 
First time we ever went to Mexican Town 
I remember, we couldn't pay the bill, they got hot 
And beat us down in the fuckin parking lot 


Tall Jess, Jump Steady, and Nate the Mack 
Tagged ICP by the train tracks 
And it was on, the dawn of a new day 
Magical carpets screaming down the freeway 


Walked in a gypsy's tent with a food stamp 
And walked out with a magical lamp, yeah 
I met Milenko, he gave me 3 wishes 
That night, I fucked 3 fat bitches 


Then get the fuck with it, forget it 
I'll rip your face off, and wipe my ass with it
When the genie says on with the show 
Hokus pokus, jokers, Great Milenko


Climb aboard our magic train and join us inside
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride
Fifty-two villians, hammered town, the show must go on
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride
Giant ladies, bearded ladies, midget ladies, ladies!
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride
Clouds of darkness and underneath them comes the clown
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride

"Fuck dat!"
