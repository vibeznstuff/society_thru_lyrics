I can feel it,
Can you feel it.

I can feel it,
Can you feel it.

I can feel it,
Can you feel it.

Feel for you baby,
Feel for you baby,
I can feel it,
Can you feel it.
Feel for you baby,
Feel for you baby,
Feel for you..

The first time we met,
I saw the fire in your eyes,
You turned me away,
I could feel the pain in my heart.
It made me feel the same without you,
Now it's time to fly away,
Across the sky,
Close your eyes,
And feel the vibe.

Feel for you baby,
Feel for you baby,
I can feel it,
Can you feel it.
Feel for you baby,
Feel for you baby,
Feel for you..

Freeing your mind,
Freeing your soul,
Freeing your mind,
Freeing your soul.
Do you know how much I feel for you.

I can feel it,
Can you feel it.

I can feel it,
Can you feel it.

I can feel it,
Can you feel it.

Feel for you baby,
Feel for you baby,
I can feel it,
Can you feel it.
Feel for you baby,
Feel for you baby,
Feel for you..
