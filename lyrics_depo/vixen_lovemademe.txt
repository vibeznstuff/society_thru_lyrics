Our conversation ends too soon, you grab your coat and leave the room
My heart dissolves onto the floor, our world divides, we don't talk anymore

And I still remember when we first met, it was on a night like this
The moon was shining for you and me
When I stood alone, I'd be betrayed by your kiss



Love made me blind to the truth
Love made me crawl, I should've stood up to you
Love made me cry out your name
So what's so good about love when it hurts you this way

Cold lurking nights, in the days there were tears
They held us captive, and chained to our fears
Is this the dream you've been searching for
Is this the love that I don't want anymore



Somewhere in a scene you were holding me, we both never fade
But the hope it sounds on the battleground, nothing's gonna change
