(You'll never know) 
You'll never, never know I care 
You'll never know the torch I bear 
You'll never know it, for I won't show it 
Oh no you'll never, never know 

(You'll never know) 
You'll never, never see me cry 
Not even when you're glancing by 
For I won't weaken, when we're speaking 
Oh no you'll never, never know 

You'll know the use to me 
That I was before 
You'll see the used to be 
That one you did adore 

(You'll never know) 
No, no I know I won't reveal 
The way I really, truly feel 
But if you guess it, I'll confess it 
Oh darling now's the time to glow 
Or else you'll never, never know 

You'll know the use to me 
That I was before 
You'll see the used to be 
That one you did adore 

(You'll never know) 
No no I no I won't reveal 
The way I really, truly feel 
But if you guess it, I'll confess it 
Oh darling now's the time to glow 
Or else you never 
No, no you'll never 
Oh no you'll never 
Never know 
(You'll never know)
