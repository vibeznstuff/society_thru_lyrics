I got it sleepin' rough on the streets in the rain
I got it learning to share my people's pain
I got it makin' flowers, growin' hearts of stone
I got it 'cause I always took the long way home
I got it sleepin' rough on the streets in the rain
I got it learning to share my people's pain
I got it makin' flowers, growin' hearts of stone
