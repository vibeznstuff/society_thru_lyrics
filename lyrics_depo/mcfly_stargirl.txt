Hey, I'm looking up for my star girl
I guess I'm stuck in this mad world
With things that I wanna say
But you're a million miles away

And I was afraid when you kissed me
On your intergalactical frisbee
I wonder why, I wonder why
You never asked me to stay


So wouldn't you like to come with me
Surfin' the sun as it starts to rise
Woah, your gravity's makin' me dizzy
Girl I gotta tell ya,
I'm feelin' much better
Make a little love in the moonlight

Hey, there's nothing on Earth that could save us
When I feel in love with Uranus
I don't wanna give you away
Cause it makes no sense at all

Houston we got a problem
Ground control couldn't stop them
I wonder why, I wonder why
You never asked me to stay


So wouldn't you like to come with me
Surfin' the sun as it starts to rise
Woah, your gravity's makin' me dizzy
Girl I gotta tell ya,
I'm feelin' much better
Make a little love in the moonlight


Fly away
Watch the night turn into day
Dance on the Milky Way
Melt me with your eyes, my star girl rules the skies
1,2,1,2,3,4

I'm looking up for my star girl
Guess I'm stuck in this mad, mad world
Things that I wanna say
But you're a million miles away


So wouldn't you like to come with me
Go surfin' the sun as it starts to rise
Yeah, wouldn't you like to come with me, (yeah)
Girl I gotta tell ya,
I'm feelin' much better
I can't get enough of you

Galaxy defenders
Stay forever
Never get enough of you
