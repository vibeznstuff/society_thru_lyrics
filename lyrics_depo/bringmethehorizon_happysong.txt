S.P.I.R.I.T.
Spirit, let's hear it
S.P.I.R.I.T.
Spirit, let's hear it
Let's go!

I've had enough
There's a voice in my head
Says I'm better off dead

But if I sing along
A little fucking louder
To a happy song
I'll be alright

You want to give up
Gave it all that you've got
And it still doesn't cut

But if you sing along
A little fucking louder
To a happy song
You'll be just fine cause'

Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I'm going round in circles
I'm going round in circles

S.P.I.R.I.T.
Spirit, let's hear it
S.P.I.R.I.T.
Spirit, let's hear it

We are possessed
We're all fucked in the head
Alone and depressed

But if we sing along
A little fucking louder
To a happy song
Maybe we'll forget cause'

Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I'm going round in circles
I'm going round in circles

Don't wake us up, we'd rather just keep dreaming
Cause' the nightmares in our heads are bad enough
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I'm going round in circles
I'm going round in circles

The world has coalesced
Into one giant mess
Of hate and unrest

So let's all sing along
A little God damn louder
To a happy song
And pretend it's all ok

Let's go!

So let's sing along
Let's sing along
A little fucking louder
A little fucking louder
Well, don't you feel so much better?

S.P.I.R.I.T.
Spirit, let's hear it
(Well, that's the spirit!)

S.P.I.R.I.T.
Spirit, let's hear it
(Yeah, that's the spirit!)
