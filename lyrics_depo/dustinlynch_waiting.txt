She waited for the light to turn green on me and her
She waited for me to speak those three little words
I dragged out a promise that I never made good
She waited as long as she could, and now

I'm sitting on the couch
Whiskey in my hand
Staring out the window
For one more second chance
Hoping headlights
Come pouring round the bend
Waiting, waiting, waiting
For her forgiving voice to come across the phone
Saying baby wait
Up I'm coming home
But in the sunrise
I'm still all alone
Waiting, waiting, waiting

Yeah she's running like a river after a hard rain
She's rolling free like a tumbleweed on a desert plain
I was the one she couldn'ts low down
Aw but look at me now



I know I should get in my truck
Chase that girl down the highway
Cause there ain't no winning her back

Just sitting on the couch
Whiskey in my hand
Staring out the window
For one more second chance
Hoping headlights
Come pouring round the bend
Waiting, waiting, waiting
For her forgiving voice
To come across the phone
Saying baby wait
Up I'm coming home
Cause in the sunrise
I'm still all alone
Waiting, waiting, waiting

Whoa
Waiting
