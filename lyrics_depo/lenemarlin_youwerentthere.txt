She came home, just won the game 
Long time struggle she fulfilled her dream 
All she wanted was to make you proud, 
You weren't there 

He had his birthday few days ago 
He got some presents, a big party too 
And there were congratulation calls 
As the years before, not ever one from you 

You weren't there, distant, far away 
It's like this every day, they see you in their heads 
Wonder if you'll come 
Afraid to close their eyes, and miss you once again 

She cut herself on a piece of paper 
It didn't hurt, but she saw the blood 
She could need that embrace, you weren't there 

Did he have to cry louder, 
Would that make you hear him 
You see, his heart was broken, for the first time 

You weren't there, distant, far away 
It's like this every day, they see you in their heads 
Wonder if you'll come 
Afraid to close their eyes, and miss you once again 

Cannot turn back time, a wish yet to come true 
They're making up these stories about you 

You weren't there, distant, far away 
It's like this every day, they see you in their heads 
Wonder if you'll come 
Afraid to close their eyes, and miss you once again
