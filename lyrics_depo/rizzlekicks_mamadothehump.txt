Or the drivers all up in your face like can I see your
Bus pass!?

Call me what you want you want but you should not call it
A night love.

Only problem being that I couldn't give a flying fuck

Comes back round
Half the rooms like Oi what's this all about, with
The other half jiving like

Yo, it's been a long week
How I've got this much energy is beyond me
I just want all of these girls to be on me
And maybe even one of them could be Beyonce.
We ain't gonna pack that rap noise in
All of that cheesy stuff, clap, clap sing
And we're gonna burn some calories right here, right now
Ain't over till a fat boy slims, mama

Drum track pounds.

When we step into the room everybody makes a pathway
Cause you know RK make the dance change
And we rule that crowd
Oh that we don't change pace at the half way.

Break sweat
No losing

Nobody gonna take my crown.
Hold back.

Especially when it's all packed out,
Crowd shouting out
