Diamond Cartier, got a plane on my fist
Lighter in my hand, colored strain in my swisher
Niggas be like "damn, boy you get it and you flex"
I just be like "nah, I just get it how I live" (oh yeah, yeah)
Pull up real fast, on my curve
0 to 100 when I swing and I swerve
See them niggas hate
But they never say a word
If I play her to the left
Bet I make her wanna flirt (oh yeah, yeah)
You know just how to move that little thing, yes
Slim thick, go on throw it to me like a Hail Mary
Hell yeah, I love it when you nasty
I'm staring at that ass whenever you pass me


Oh, oh, oh
I like you when you nasty
I like you when you nasty
I like you when you nasty
Oh, oh, oh
I like you when you nasty
I like you when you nasty
I like you when you nasty


I like you when you nasty
That's when all my girls get on a classy
Hit you from the back in back of the backseat
Hydraulics how we tippin' and waggin'
I'm with a freak in the sheets
Big booty tip drill like the gem of the week
She always wanna ride til she fallin' asleep
808 poundin' her like I'm makin' a beat
So I swear I can't control when I hit it
Whippin' cake, put her in the bowl how I lick it
Like a cheerleader on the pole when she spin it
If she throw that ass I'm a throw that ass some digits


Oh, oh, oh
I like you when you nasty
I like you when you nasty
I like you when you nasty
Oh, oh, oh
I like you when you nasty
I like you when you nasty
I like you when you nasty


I see you on the sideline, workin' on your game
I could put you in the zone, I could help you make a play
It's something 'bout that champagne get you in a state
LA attitude and Atlanta in the waist, (oh no no)
Don't waste nothin' in your cup
Class just started and we movin' to the sub
It's a movie, check IMDb for the cast
I talk with my money and you talkin' out your ass
Blah, blah, blah
Said you could tell them other bitches bye-bye
Lemme get you city high, brown eyes, 5'5"
5'7" in them heels, go on get them thangs on
Freak of the week, we all singing the same song


Oh, oh, oh
I like you when you nasty
I like you when you nasty
I like you when you nasty
Oh, oh, oh
I like you when you nasty
I like you when you nasty
I like you when you nasty


I saw you like it, when we go and bang down, get nasty
Ass I shake, oh I saw you like when I twerk
Do you like it, when we go and bang down, get nasty
Ass I shake, oh I saw you like when I twerk
I saw you like it, when we go and bang down, get nasty
Ass I shake...


Oh, oh, oh
I like you when you nasty
I like you when you nasty
I like you when you nasty
Oh, oh, oh
I like you when you nasty
I like you when you nasty
I like you when you nasty
