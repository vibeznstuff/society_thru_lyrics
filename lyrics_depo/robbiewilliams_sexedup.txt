Loose lips sunk ships
I'm getting to grips with what you said
No it's not in my head
I can't awaken the dead
Day after day

Why don't we talk about it
Why do you always doubt that there can be a better way
It doesn't make me wanna stay

Why don't we break up
There's nothing left to say
I got my eyes shut
Praying they won't stray
Oh we're not sexed up
That's what makes the difference today
I hope you blow away

You say we're fatally flawed
When I'm easily bored
Is that OK?
Strike me off your list
Make this the last kiss
I walk away

Why don't we talk about it?
I'm only here don't shout it
Give 'em time, you'll forget
Let's pretend we never met

Why don't we break up?
There's nothing left to say
I got my eyes shut
Praying they won't stray
Oh we're not sexed up
That's what makes the difference today
I hope you blow away

Screw you
I didn't like your taste anyway
I chose you
That's all go to waste it
It's Saturday
I'll go out and find another you

Why don't we?
Why don't we break up?
There's nothing left to say
I got my eyes shut
Praying they won't stray
Oh we're not sexed up
That's what makes the difference today
I hope you blow away
I hope you blow away
I hope you blow away
