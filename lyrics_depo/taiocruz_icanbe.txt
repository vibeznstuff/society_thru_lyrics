Now I feel that this heart, of mine has
taken many falls,
Still sometimes the rain, can turn into a
waterfall,
And the prettiest things, can come out
of the coldest night,
And even with broken wings, sometimes
you find your way to fly
Yes I Can Be...


Bigger, Bigger
Stronger, Stronger
Harder, Harder
Yes I Can Be...
Bigger, Bigger
Stronger, Stronger
Harder, Harder
Yes I Can Be...
Now I feel that this soul, of mine has
had its many tolls,
Still sometimes this pain, is what we
need for us to grow,
So when it's time for me, to look into my
deeper side, I will...
I will find a way, to hold onto the love
inside,
Yes I Can Be...



See I can be anything I wanna be,
All I have to do is put my mind to it...
and I can do it,
So what I want you to do, is put your
fist in the sky,
And say it with me,
I Can Be...
