Every Friday
My head's spinnin' round and round
Been workin' all week now, baby
Yes it's my day
I take a trip downtown
To my favorite club now, baby

That's when I see you
With loving arms to fall into
But I'm not looking for full time love
There's still so much I wanna do



I only kiss kiss kiss when the sun don't shine
Oh Ohoh! Oh Ohoh!
You wanna kiss kiss kiss then tonight is fine
Oh Ohoh! Oh Ohoh!

Can live without it
I don't want a full time love
Cause it's not on my mind now baby
You know my freedom
Is what I'm thinking of 
And I ain't got the time now baby

Straight out of the blue
You came and asked me to
Be your date in the daytime babe
But I'm sorry no can do
