I'm in a little bit of trouble
And I'm in real deep
From the beginning to the end
He was no more than a friend to me

The thought is makin' me hazy
I think I better sit down
Cause like the sweetest serenade
Bet he knows he's got it made with me

Twisting round on a carousel
This speeds' too much to stop
One second I'm thinkin' I'm feeling the lust
And then I feel a lot

Ooh that man is like a flame
And ooh that man plays me like a game
My only sin is I can't win
Ooh I wanna love that man
Ooh that man is on my list
And ooh that man I wanna kiss
My only sin is I can't win
Ooh I wanna love that man

Now it's like I'm on a mission
Headed everywhere
And if it takes a little long
And it feels a little wrong, who cares?

My baby fits the description
And does it easily
A little Gable, some Astaire
When he dances I can hardly breathe

Someone call a doctor
Need some help to rescue me
One second I'm thinkin' I must be lost
And he keeps on findin' me

Ooh that man is like a flame
And ooh that man plays me like a game
My only sin is I can't win
Ooh I wanna love that man
Ooh that man is on my list
And ooh that man I wanna kiss
My only sin is I can't win
Ooh I wanna love that man

Dub dub dub dub du dubu

Pa da dub dub dub to to
I'm gonna find that man
(Ooh that man is like a flame
And ooh that man plays me like a game
My only sin is I can't win)
Ooh I wanna love that man
Ooh that man is on my list
And ooh that man I wanna kiss
My only sin is I can't win
Ooh I wanna love that man


"You know, I've been calling you for about two days now and I eh...
I wanted to see you darling, I really do, you know, because...
I think of you and eh...
All of me kind of goes a little bit crazy, so eh...
I believe it's a match darling...
You should phone me, and we will have...
A night at the Cos Bar that neither of us will ever forget
A beautiful evening of love, lust and paradise
You can make it nice, call me back
On Riverside at 42239
Ciao ciao"
