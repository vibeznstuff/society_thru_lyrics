Never ever wanted to be with you
All you ever gave me was the boredom I suffocate in
Adrift in cheap dreams don't stop the rain
Numbed out in piss towns just wanna dig their graves

Motown, motown junk
I laughed when lennon got shot
21 years of living and nothing means anything to me

Motown junk a lifetime of slavery
Songs of love echo underclass betrayal
Stops your heart beating for 168 seconds
Stops your brain thinking for 168 seconds
Motown junk, motown junk, motown junk, motown junk

I don't want cos I just get
All your slut heroes offer is a fear of the future
Past made useless cos I'm dying now
Communal tyranny a jail that bleeds our wrists

Motown, motown junk
I laughed when lennon got shot
21 years of living and nothing means anything to me

Motown junk a lifetime of slavery
Songs of love echo underclass betrayal
Stops your heart beating for 168 seconds
Stops your brain thinking for 168 seconds
Motown junk, motown junk, motown junk, motown junk

Motown junk a lifetime of slavery
Songs of love echo underclass betrayal
Stops your heart beating for 168 seconds
Stops your brain thinking for 168 seconds
Motown junk, motown junk, motown junk, motown junk

We live in urban hell, we destroy rock and roll
