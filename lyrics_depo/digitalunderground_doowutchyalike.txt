And just peep this, y'all, 'cause we're singin' a song,
And doowutchyalike, yeah doowutchyalike

Now we're all gettin' stupid, and actin' a fool,
Anything that ya really wanna do is cool,
So, Goldfingers, cutwutchyalike

Now if you're hungry, get yourself something to eat,
And if you're dirty, then go take a bath,
And doowutchyalike.
Stetsasonics, adjust for the hip-hop fans,
And since we're not your average everyday rap band,
Yo, Pianoman, playhowyalike


Just act a fool, it's okay if you drool,
'Cause everybody's gonna strip, and jump in the pool,
(Wait a minute, wait a minute, don't take your clothes off yet, not yet,

Straight hair, curled, casual and glamor,
A shy girl, or loud like a bama.
From Connecticut, or from Louisiana,
Bad table ettiqutte, too much chatter,
Very well spoken, or real bad grammer,
I minority token, a brother in the slammer,
A free civilian with a house in Santa Ana,
If ya got a million, and live in Atlanta,
If you got a weak bladder, or can't climb a ladder,
What we're sayin' is, it really doesn't matter,
I need a word that sounds like "atta"
Slipped on a peel of banana,
Doowutchyalike.
(Yeah, cool, gettin' stupid, once again, you got the sound of the 
underground.  Baby dope is in the house.)
(Boyyy!!)
(Are we puttin' things in check, Baby D?)
(Too stupid check)
(I'm wit' it. Yo Dave, let's show 'em some old school)
It makes no sense just standin' around,
Come on everybody, let's all...(Hang out)
Yeah, and doowutwelike,
From a lime to a lemon, a lemon to a lime,
Come on, young ladies, let's have... (Good times)
And doowutwelike.
Now, I can sing, I can dance, I'm the king of romance,
Are you sweet young ladies gonna give me a chance,
To doowutchyalike?
And get that thing packed tonight.
Vanessa Williams, ooh, you're so divine, 
Just wanted to put your name in my rhyme,
And doowutchyalike,
Yeah, everybody doowutchyalike.
