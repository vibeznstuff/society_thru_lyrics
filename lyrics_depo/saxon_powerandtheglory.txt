I'm a soldier of fortune I'm trained and I'm ready to kill
Put me to battle I'll follow the sound of the gun
Give me an order, command me I'll fire at will

I've got no emotions I'm living with thunder and steel
I don't hear your lies all I hear are your battle cries
I'm a soldier of fortune I'm trained and I'm ready to die

To the power and the glory
Raise your glasses high
To the power and the glory
Be with me tonight

A cold death awaits me tonight if I stumble or fall
My friends lay around me their bodies all tattered and torn
But mine is not to reason why, mine is just to do or die

To the power and the glory
Raise your glasses high
To the power and the glory
Be with me tonight

Can you feel the power
Can you feel the glory
Can you feel the power
Can you feel the glory
Can you feel the power
Is it with you tonight

I'm fighting for freedom, I'm safe, I've got God on my side
What price in life can you justify your battle hymn
The General says we'll will win the war, just sacrificed a thousand more

To the power and the glory
Raise your glasses high
To the power and the glory
Be with me tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

To the power and the glory
Raise your glasses high
To the power and the glory
Be with me tonight
Tonight, yaya
