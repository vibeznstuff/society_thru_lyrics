Why you hurt me?
Why you make me so sick?
Why you take and take?
Even change the laws
You deregulate
Seek to destroy our homes
You're a mean old man

What's your legacy?
Burning fields in Iraq
Burning fields in Nigeria
Burning oceans
Burning populations
Our burning lungs

Burning people
Burning hope
Burning planet
All for your wealth

Your wealth is predicated
On the poverty of others
Others must be poor if
You're to be rich

What is your dream?
And when will it end?
You're a mean old man

What do you want?
What do you hope for?
For Jesus to kill you?

Jesus will kill you
Your soft seat
Your soft face
Your protected babies
Jesus will kill you
