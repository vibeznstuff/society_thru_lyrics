Here we are, a careful distance
Here's my heart, what's left of it
In this town, I used to listen
Once, once, Yeah

I had hope, blind faith
Had as much as you can take

I'm only gonna let you kill me once
I'm only gonna let you kill me then some
I'm only gonna let you kill me
Once, once, once, yeah

Once, once, once, yeah
Once, once, once, yeah
Once, once...

Ashes burn the morning after
Only know I'm here to stay
I was so, I let you see me
That was dumb, but that's OK
Tripping down to your place
What is love anyway?

I'm only gonna let you kill me once
I'm only gonna let you kill me then some

I'm only gonna let you kill me
Once, once, once, yeah
Once, once, once, yeah
Once, once, once, yeah
I'm only gonna let you kill me

Who or whatever you do
Don't let anyone love you
Touch them where it hurts
And then you'll leave

I'm only gonna let you kill me once
I'm only gonna let you kill me then some

I'm only gonna let you kill me
Once, once, once, yeah
Once, once, once, yeah
Once, once, once, yeah

I'm only gonna let you kill me
Once, once, once, yeah
Once, once, once, yeah
Once, once, once, yeah
Once, once, once, yeah
