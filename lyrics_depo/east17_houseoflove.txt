Everybody in the house of love
Everybody in the house of love
One love, one God
Everybody in the house of love

We've got to stop the pain, and put the wars on hold
Let the power of love, inside the soul unfold
Free the mind, let it rise above
We've got to change this world to a world of love
Mother Earth she's on overload
One more war and she might explode
We've got to look back and see a love from the past
We've got the time to change it but it's running out fast

Not bothered about your colour, concerned about your creed
In the house of love, everybody's free
Not bothered about your colour, concerned about your creed
In the house of love, everybody's free

Everybody in the house of love
Everybody in the house of love
One love, one God
Everybody in the house of love 

How many more tears must she cry
How many more fears must be felt inside
Before we realise we're going too far
The Creator created, we tore it apart
But love can guide us back to the right road
We gotta save the planet, before she explodes
We've got to love our mother gotta let her know
Boom, boom, before she blows

Not bothered about religion, not bothered about belief
In the house of love, everybody's free
Not bothered about religion, not bothered about belief
In the house of love, everybody's free

Everybody in the house of love
Everybody in the house of love
One love, one God
Everybody in the house of love 

Born to live, we live to die
Our eyes can't see they can only cry
But our mother's tired of crying, she's had enough
She's gonna surely blow, 'cause we're giving up
Build the house of love while we've got the time
Too many bombs in a world it's like a living mine
The house of love is what we must build
The past won't lost if the present is killed!

Not bothered about your colour, concerned about your creed
In the house of love, everybody's free
Not bothered about your colour, concerned about your creed
In the house of love, everybody's free

Everybody in the house of love
Everybody in the house of love
One love, one God
Everybody in the house of love 

Everybody in the house of love 

Everybody in the house of love
Everybody in the house of love
One love, one God
Everybody in the house of love 

Everybody in the house of love
Everybody in the house of love
Come on now, feel the soul
Everybody in the house of...
