Wish you've gone-a, wish you've gone away, what you've gone-a
What you've got has always gone away
Cassius! Cassius! at best, it's all that we could do
All that we could do

The wind is in, the wind is in my heart, the wind is in-
Now what you've got has always gone away
Cassius! Cassius! at best, it's all that we could do
All that we could do

Cassius, is over! You're second best!
