Turning and turning
The world goes on
We can't change it, my friend
Let us go riding now through the days
Together to the end 
To the end

Les bicyclettes de Belsize
Carry us side by side
And hand in hand we will ride
Over Belsize
Turn your magical eyes
Round and around
Looking at all we've found
Carry us through the skies
Les bicyclettes de Belsize

Spinning and spinning
The dreams I know
Rolling on through my head
Let us enjoy them before they go
Come the dawn, they all are dead
Yes, they're dead

Les bicyclettes de Belsize
Carry us side by side
And hand in hand we will ride
Over Belsize
Turn your magical eyes
Round and around
Lookin' at all we've  found
Carry us through the skies
Les bicyclettes de Belsize
