It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember,
Yes, I will
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Mama, I'm depending on you
To tell me the truth
Mama just hung her head and said, "Son,..


Papa was a rolling stone.
Wherever he laid his hat was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.
Papa was a rolling stone, my son.
Wherever he laid his hat was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

Hey, mama!
Is it true what they say that papa never worked a day in his life?
And, mama, some bad talk goin' round town sayin' that papa had three outside children and another wife,
And that ain't right
Heard them talking papa doing some store front preachin'
Talked about saving souls and all the time leechin'
Dealing in debt and stealing in the name of the Lord
Mama just hung her head and said,


"Papa was a rolling stone, my son.
Wherever he laid his hat was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.
Papa was a rolling stone.
Wherever he laid his hat was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone."

Hey, mama,
I heard papa called himself a "Jack Of All Trades"
Tell me is that what sent papa to an early grave?
Folks say papa would beg, borrow, steal
To pay his bills
Hey, mama,
Folks say papa never was much on thinking
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking
Mama, I'm depending on you
To tell me the truth
Mama looked up with a tear in her eye and said, "Son,..


Papa was a rolling stone (well, well...)
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone."


I said, "Papa was a rolling stone (yes, he was, my son)
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
My daddy was (papa was a rolling stone), yes, he was
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone."
