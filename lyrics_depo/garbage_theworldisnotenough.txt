I know how to hurt
I know how to heal
I know what to show
And what to conceal
I know when to talk
And I know when to touch
No-one ever die from wanting to much


The world is not enough
But it is such a perfect place to start...my love
And if you're strong enough
Together we can take the world apart...my love

People like us
Know how to survive
There's no point in living
If you can't feel the life
We know when to kiss
And we know when to kill
If we can't have it all
Then nobody will




(I...)I feel safe
(I...)I feel scared
(I...)I feel ready
(I...)And yet unprepared



The world is not enough 
No nowhere near enough...
