Madder than a mad man and bored to the core
Minute hand crawling, can't take it anymore
Future's up the highway, I gotta get away
Gonna take a little trip and find a Tijuana stray

I got the time to take it
I got the balls to break it
Gotta car that'll make it
South of the border
Don't drink the water

Gonna have a good time tonight
Crazy from the heat and runnin' for the red light
Oh senorita
Have two Tequila
Love seeker
Lord, the will is getting weaker
Gonna have a good time tonight
Burnin' with the fever and runnin' for the red light
She ain't a teacher
She ain't a preacher
Just so close to holy that you're runnin' just to reach her

Time bomb is tickin', my head's about to burst
Need some personal attention or I swear I'm gonna rust
Gonna find a little place, no-one will tell you what to do
Tell her I'm a rebel, she says 'Yeah, without a clue'

Just need some understanding
A girl who ain't demanding
Who ain't afraid to fake it
South of the border
Don't drink the water

Gonna have a good time tonight
Crazy from the heat and runnin' for the red light
Oh senorita
Have two Tequila
Love seeker
Lord, the will is getting weaker
Gonna have a good time tonight
Burnin' with the fever and runnin' for the red light
She ain't a teacher
She ain't a preacher
Just so close to holy that you gotta run to reach her

Need some understanding
A girl who ain't demanding
A little bad behaviour
She's gonna be my saviour
My knees are shakin'
My back is breakin'
Oh mama mia
A' senorita

Gonna have a good time tonight
Crazy from the heat and runnin' for the red light
Oh senorita
Have three Tequila
Love seeker
Lord, the will is getting weaker
Gonna have a good time tonight
Burnin' with the fever and runnin' for the red light
She ain't a teacher
She ain't a preacher
Just so close to holy that you're runnin' just to reach her

Gonna have a good time tonight
Crazy from the heat and runnin' for the red light
Oh senorita
Have some Tequila
Need sneakers
Lord, the will is getting weaker
Gonna have a good time tonight
Burnin' with the fever and runnin' for the red light
Just heard the bell, that got me outta hell
I got a girl, I gotta life...
