I can see I'm a little unstable 
Mystified, I'm tired and unable 
To switch it on and switch it off daily 
It's OK to say how you see me 

It's about my time 
There's no way 
Please, this isn't working 
I can't breathe 
Got no air now 

How can I live when I want to be free? 
This is my time and these are my needs 
It's OK to want before you fall down 
You're sending me off on a mission I'm bound 

Got to, got to, got to go crazy 

Can you tell I'm a little bit hungry? 
Mr Fabulous don't impress me 
He talks to me with a speech without words 
With the vowels all missing and the truth unheard 

Please, this isn't working 
I can't breathe 
Got no air now 

It's all about the money 
It's all about the fame 
It's not about the way you live your life 
This is how I'm gonna break it down now 

How can I live when I want to be free? 
This is my time and these are my needs 
It's OK to want before you fall down 
You're sending me up on a mission, I'm bound 

Give it to me 
Ha! 

Can't you see I'm a little bit weary 
In a three piece suit and shoes that don't fit me 
You're bright-eyed-bushy-tailed pushing it round 
No I won't let it go, no I won't stop, won't stop 

How can I live when I want to be free? 
This is my time and these are my needs 
It's OK to want before you fall down 
You're sending me up on a mission, I'm bound 

How can I live when I want to be free? 
This is my time and these are my needs 
It's OK to want before you fall down 
You're sending me up on a mission, I'm bound 

You're sending me up on a mission, I'm bound 
You're sending me up on a mission, I'm bound 
You're sending me up on a mission, I'm bound 

Ha!
