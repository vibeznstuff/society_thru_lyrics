High on diesel and gasoline, psycho for drum machine
shaking their bits to the hits,
Drag acts, drug acts, suicides, in your dad's suits you hide
staining his name again,
Cracked up, stacked up, 22, psycho for sex and glue
lost it to Bostik, yeah,
Shaved heads, rave heads, on the pill, got too much time to kill
get into bands and gangs,

Oh, here they come, the beautiful ones, the beautiful ones

loved up, Doved up, hung around, stoned in a lonely town
shaking their meat to the beat,
High on diesel and gasoline, psycho for drum machine
shaking their bits to the hits,

Oh, here they come, the beautiful ones, the beautiful ones.

You don't think about it,
You don't do without it,
because you're beautiful,
And if your baby's going crazy
that's how you made me,

la, la, la, la...
