Sometimes I wonder how I'd ever make it through
Through this world without having you 
I just wouldn't have a clue 

'Cause sometimes it seems like this world's closing in on me
And there's no way of breaking free 
And then I see you reach for me 

Sometimes I wanna give up, wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight 
And then I see you baby 
And everything's alright, everything's alright 

When I see you smile, I can face the world
Oh, oh
You know I can do anything 
When I see you smile, I see a ray of light
Oh, oh

I see it shining right through the rain 
When I see you smile 
Baby when I see you smile at me
Oh, yeah

Baby there's nothing in this world that could ever do 
What a touch of your hand can do 
It's like nothing that I ever knew 
Hay

And when the rain is falling, I don't feel it
'Cause you're here with me now 
And one look at you baby 
Is all I'll ever need, all I'll ever need

Sometimes I wanna give up, I wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight 
Then one look at you baby
And everything's alright
Hay, everything's alright 
It's alright
