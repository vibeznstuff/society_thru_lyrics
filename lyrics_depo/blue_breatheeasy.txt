Cruel to the eye
I see the way he makes you smile
Cruel to the eye
Watching him hold what used to be mine

Why did I lie?
What did I walk away to find
Oooohhh...why...oooh -- why...


I... can't breathe easy
Can't sleep at night
Till you're by my side
No I... can't breathe easy
I can't dream yet another dream
Without you lying next to me
There's no air

Curse me inside
For every word that caused you to cry
Curse me inside

I won't forget, no i won't baby,
I don't know why (don't know why)
I left the one i was looking to find

Ooh -- why...ooooh, why -- why...



Out of my mind
Nothing makes sense anymore
I want you back in my life

That's all I'm breathing for

Ooooooohhhhh -- tell me why

Oh won't you tell me why

I can't dream yet another dream
Without you lying next to me
There's no air

I... can't breathe easy
Can't sleep at night

Till you're by my side

Coz i can't breathe easy

I can't dream yet another dream
Without you lying next to me
There's no air

There's no air.
