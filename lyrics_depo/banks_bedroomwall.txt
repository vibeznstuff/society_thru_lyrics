My arms are open for you look at me now
Baby if you want you got me
I know you're broken darling and I won't let you down
Baby I've been waiting for you

I know you like acting like you don't care
But I can be distant don't want to be distant anymore
Darling look at me standing here
This is my promise, cross my heart promise, this is all yours

See these feelings are outta control
Talk about losing losing all my shit for you
Cause I've been thinking about thinking about
Putting my body body body on top of you

You know how I see you, we should be one
Cause I already told you baby
Last time that I tried to sing you this song
Couldn't get the words out baby
My arms are open for you look at me now
Baby if you want you got me
I know you're broken darling I won't let you down
Cause baby I've been waiting for you

Do I have to write it on your bedroom wall, you fool? 
Do I, do I, do I, do I, do I
