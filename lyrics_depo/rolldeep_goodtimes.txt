I'm gonna leave the day behind, don't you worry cause I'm gonna have a real good time


We're gonna have a real good time


I'm gonna leave the world outside, spend my money, oh it's gonna be a real good night


We're gonna have a real good night
Go late night shoppin', high street boppin'
Let's go west end clubbin', champagne poppin'
Let's keep it rockin', party ain't stoppin'
Let's keep it, keep it rockin,
party ain't stoppin

No fear, good times are here
When I come round the good times appear, good times are near
I like to live life like where they all gone? The good times are here, where?
Late nights shoppin' on the Thursday, and I pull out more than a birthday
I'm always flying abroad,
When I wake up tomorrow I'm gonna be on the 1st plane


9 to 5, when it's over I can come alive,
I'm in the mood to live a higher life, now when the DJ drops a song of mine, I'll be satisfied


I'm gonna leave the day behind, don't you worry cause I'm gonna have a real good time


We're gonna have a real good time


I'm gonna leave the world outside, spend my money, oh it's gonna be a real good night


We're gonna have a real good night
Go late night shoppin', high street boppin'
Let's go west end clubbin', champagne poppin'
Let's keep it rockin', party ain't stoppin'
Let's keep it, keep it rockin,
party ain't stoppin


I want everybody on the at list
To feel this fantastic, if you see a good time, grab it, have a laugh, don't let it pass
We get 1 life and it goes quite rapid
Bad times can't match it, this is the best way to live
Non stop party, all round the clock with no negatives,
have a good time and stay positive.

Let's keep it rockin', party ain't stoppin'
let's keep it, keep it rockin,
party ain't stopping


Flash dirty cash, I'm splashing out and share wiv the fam and give the whole ration out.
Keep the level up while the rest are freshing out, anybody gassing and I'm lashing out standard.
Just started, party ain't over, we can't beat that everybody's still sober, call all the freeloaders over tell them to have a bottle and a glass on me.


The night ain't done; the night's still young
It's just started it's just begun, the night ain't over it's only 1.
I ain't half hearted I'm spending more than a tonne.
Celebrate every day like a b'day, the party don't stop unless we say, I'm in the mic like if I was the DJ, you only get one life no replay!
