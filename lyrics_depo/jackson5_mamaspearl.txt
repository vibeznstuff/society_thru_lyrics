You send cold chills up and down my spine
We kiss for thrills, then you draw the line oh baby (oh baby)
Cause your mama told you that love ain't right
But don't you know that lovin' is the spice of life, yeah.


Mama's pearl, let down those curls
Let me give my love a whirl
Find what you been missing (what you been missing)
Ooh ooh now baby

Goody girl, let down those curls
Let me give your heart a twirl
Don't keep me wishin' (keep me wishin')
(Bum ba bum ba bum ba bum bum
bum ba bum ba bum ba bum bum bum
bum ba bum ba bum ba bum bum
Bum ba bum ba bum ba bum bum bum)

You want my lovin' yes you do do do (Yes you do, I know you do)
Know my lovin' is true true true now baby (Oh baby)
But your conscience tells you that love is wrong (Love is wrong, ooh)
But don't you know that lovin' never hurt no one, oh.



Let it all hang out (Girl don't be afraid
Oh we've got the first step made
Ooh, the rest is up to you
Here is what you do, let yourself go)
Let yourself just go, now now now
Let your lovin' flow, now now now
Just give it to me
(Cause I've got what you need)
Got what you need
Let's fall in love, let's fall in love
Find out what you're missing
Goody girl, let down your curls
Let me give your heart a twirl
Why don't you give my love a whirl
Girl don't be afraid
Oh we've got the first step made
Just give in, just give in to me
Cause I've got what you need
Got what you need
(Let's fall in love, let's fall in love
Let yourself go)
Let yourself just go, let your lovin' flow
Just give it to me
(Cause I've got what you need got what you need)
(Mama's pearl, don't be afraid
Let's fall in love, let's fall in love
Daddy's girl we've got it made
Let's fall in love, let's fall in love)
Find out what you been missing sugar
Goody goody goody girl
(Mama's pearl, don't be afraid
Let's fall in love, let's fall in love
Daddy's girl we've got it made
Let's fall in love, let's fall in love)
