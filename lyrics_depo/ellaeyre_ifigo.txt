I could play any game for you
I could say what you want me to
I could lie, I could lie
'Cause you're wanting a little more
And I'm stuck in the middle of,
But I try, but I try

But I need time, and I need space
I need to live without your face

But if I go will you love me?
Will you love me until I can
And do you know, will you want me?
Will you want me like that?
And if I leave, will it end?
Will you need me again?
If I go, will you love me?
Will you love me when I come back?

I could be what you want me to
Can you hold out and let me do what I want?
What I want?
Tell me how long could you wait till you move on
And tell me that it's too late!
It's too late!

But if I go will you love me?
Will you love me until I can
And do you know, will you want me?
Will you want me like that?
And if I leave, will it end?
Will you need me again?
If I go, will you love me?
Will you love me when I come back?

Ooh, boy
(Will you love me? Will you love me?)
Oh, when I come back
(Will you love me? Will you love me?)
No, oh, oh, oh
When I come back

But if I go will you love me?
Will you love me until I can
And do you know, will you want me?
Will you want me like that?
And if I leave, will it end?
Will you need me again?
If I go, will you love me?
Will you love me when I come back?
