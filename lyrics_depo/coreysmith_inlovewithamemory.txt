We Were listening to the Radio 
After Dark, in the Park by Hurricane Shoals 
on A blanket by the waterfalls, 
Holdin hands, Sweet Romance untill the Rooster Called 
Then I drove her home thinkin Ain't love grand, 
Oh I've never felt that way before, and I never have again.. 


Now I'm in Love with a memory, 
Sweet history's got a hold of me, 
So dont't go fallin for me now... 
We sould never be, 
Cause I'm in love with a Memory 

We were lying on the Midland Train, 
down 29, just barley hiding from the four lane 
Close my Eyes and I can see her still, 
Perfect body streched out for me, every tan line reveled 
She headed of to college that September, 
And she left me with a kiss, that I always will remember... 


Now I'm in love with a memory, 
Sweet history's got a hold of me, 
So don't go fallin for me now, 
We could never be, 
Cause I'm in love with a Memory 

Oh Many girls have come and gone, 
Half the Women in this county swear my heart is made of stone, 
That one old flame still burns away, 
Yeah the love I lost ten years ago, Is the one I long for today 


And I'm in love, OH I'm in love with a Memory 
Sweet history's got a hold of me, 
SO don't fallin for me now, 
We could never be, 
Cause I'm in love with a Memory 

We could never be, 
Cause I'm in love with a memory 
Oh I'm in love with a memory
