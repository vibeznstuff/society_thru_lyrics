If I had a great big mansion
I'd rather live in a shot gun shack with you

If I drove a red farari
I'd rather ride in an oldsmobile with you

If I won a million dollars
I'd give it away to spend more time with you

If I had a million lovers
I would trade em all for just one more night with you

With you I can be myself
With you I don't have to be somebody else
It's like puttin on my favorite pair of shoes
I'd like to be with me, when I'm with you

If I owned the finest vineyard
I would rather sit and drink cheap wine with you

If I could live on the moon
I would rather stay in Tennessee with you

If I could sail across the ocean
The ocean would just be blue without you

If I could climb up Mount Everest
I would turn around and climb in bed with you

With you I can be myself
With you I don't have to be somebody else
It's like puttin on my favorite pair of shoes
I like to be with me when I'm with you

If I could be like Albert Einstein
I'd rather just be dumb and be with you

If I could sing like Frank Sinatra
I would rather sit and talk to you

With you I can be myself
With you I don't have to be somebody else
It's like puttin on my favorite pair of shoes
I like to be with me, when I'm with you
