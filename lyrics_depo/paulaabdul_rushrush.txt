YOU'RE THE WHISPER OF A SUMMER BREEZE 
YOU'RE THE KISS THAT PUTS MY SOUL AT EASE 
WHAT I'M SAYING IS I'M 
IN TO YOU 
HERE'S MY STORY, AND THE STORY GOES 

YOU GIVE LOVE, YOU GET LOVE AND MORE THAN HEAVEN KNOWS 
YOU'RE GONNA SEE 
I'M GONNA RUN, I'M GONNA TRY 
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS LOVE 
RIGHT TO YA 
ALL MY HEART, ALL THE JOY 
OH BABY, BABY PLEASE 

 
RUSH, RUSH 
HURRY, HURRY LOVER, COME TO ME 
RUSH, RUSH 
I WANNA SEE, I WANNA SEE YA 
GET FREE WITH ME 
RUSH, RUSH 
I CAN FEEL IT, I CAN FEEL YOU ALL THROUGH ME 
RUSH, RUSH 
OOH WHAT YOU DO TO ME 

AND ALL I WANT FROM YOU IS WHAT YOU ARE 
AND EVEN IF YOU'RE RIGHT NEXT TO ME 
YOU'RE STILL TOO FAR AWAY IF I'M NOT INSIDE YOUR ARMS 
I GET DRAMATIC BABY, YES I KNOW 
BUT I NEED YOU, I WANT YOU 
OOH MAN, I LOVE YOU SO 

OOH, OOH

WHEN YOU KISS ME 
UP AND DOWN 
TURN MY SENSES ALL AROUND 
OH BABY, OH BABY

JUST HOW OR WHY 
BUT NO ONE ELSE

SO DEEP INSIDE 

YOU'RE GONNA SEE 
I'M GONNA RUN 
I'M GONNA TRY 
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS LOVE RIGHT TO YA

ALL MY HEART, ALL THE JOY 
OH BABY, BABY PLEASE
