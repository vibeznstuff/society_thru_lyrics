Fast and furious we ride the universe
To carve a road for us that slices every curve in sight
We accelerate,no time to hesitate
This load will detonate whoever would contend its right
Born to lead at breakneck speed with high octane
We're spitting flames freewheel burning
On we catapult, we're thrusting to the hilt
Unearthing every fault, go headlong into any dare
We don't accept defeat, we never will retreat
We blaze with scorching heat obliterations everywhere
Look before you leap has never been the way we keep
Our road is free
Charging to the top
And never give in never stops the way to be
Hold on to the lead with all your will and concede
You'll find there's life with victory on high
