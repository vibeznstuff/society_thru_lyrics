Remember me!! 

So you confess, 
To all the way you’ve been seeing 
Now you feel regret, yeah 
But that don’t mean shit to me 
No, no 
So empty what you can say 
Take a minute please 
It’s too little too late 
To make it up to me 
I hope that those tears refresh your memory 
Now when another makes you cry 

 
That’s when you, remember me 
I’m the one that had you baby
I’m the one who loved you baby 
Remember me 
I’m the one that had you baby
I’m the one who loved you baby 

I guess it wasn’t enough 
To give you everything, no no 
And I guess I should have know better 
How could I be so naïve 
I don’t know, 
So empty what you can say 
Take a minute please 
It’s too little too late 
To make it up to me 
I hope that those tears refresh your memory 
Now when you’re all alone at night 

 
That’s when you, remember me 
I’m the one that had you baby
I’m the one who loved you baby 
Remember me 
I’m the one that had you baby
I’m the one who loved you baby 

Now when you all alone at night 

 
That’s when you, remember me 
I’m the one that had you baby
I’m the one who loved you baby 
Remember me 
I’m the one that had you baby
I’m the one who loved you.
