Goodbye Sam hello Samantha
Goodbye Sam hello Samantha

Sam, I'm leavin' the gang
So don't come around for me on Sunday.
Joe, I want you to know
I'll have to skip the game on Monday.
Had a whole lot of fun
But now the time has come
I need the sweet touch of a woman's love.

Goodbye Sam hello Samantha
Goodbye Joe hello Joanne.
Suddenly need a new kind of company
Someone to love me.
Goodbye Sam hello Samantha
Goodbye Lou hello Louise.
From today there'll be new games
For me to play
So good luck and goodbye Sam.

Guys you ought-a get wise
There's more to the world than pool and fishin'.
Easy ridin' is fine
But look around see what you're missin'.
Girls are waitin' in line
And now has come the time
I'm goin' out and I'm gonna get me some.

Goodbye Sam hello Samantha
Goodbye Joe hello Joanne.
Suddenly need a new kind of company
Someone to love me.
Goodbye Sam hello Samantha
Goodbye Lou hello Louise.
From today there'll be new games
For me to play
So good luck and goodbye Sam.
