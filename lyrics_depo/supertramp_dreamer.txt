Dreamer, you know you are a dreamer
Well can you put your hands in your head, oh no!
I said dreamer, you're nothing but a dreamer
Well can you put your hands in your head, oh no!
I said "Far out, what a day, a year, a life it is!"
You know, well you know you had it comin' to you
Now there's not a lot I can do

Dreamer, you stupid little dreamer
So now you put your head in your hands, oh no!
Wow!

I said "Far out, what a day, a year, a life it is!"
You know, well you know you had it comin' to you
Now there's not a lot I can do

Well, work it out someday

If I could see something
You can see anything you want boy
If I could be someone
You can be anyone, celebrate boy
If I could do something
Well, you can do something
If I could do anything
Well, can you do something out of this world?

Take a dream on a Sunday
Take a life, take a holiday
Take a lie, take a dreamer
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream along

Dreamer, you know you are a dreamer
Well can you put your hands in your head, oh no!
I said dreamer, you're nothing but a dreamer
Well, can you put your hands in your head, oh no!
Oh no!
Dreamer...
