i wonder
if he knows i've been watching him
and i wonder
if he knows i can feel him
and i wonder
in my dreams when i'm sleeping, and i'm keeping him close to me
i'm thinking
he's the thunder, i'm the lightning
and i'm thinking
maybe we can come together
and i'm thinking
we can bring the rain with a lovely breeze with such harmony


like a train on a track like spokes inside a wheel
involuntary motion like rolling down hill
and there's no way to stop it
it's a natural thing like sunrise and dusk
snowflakes, waterfalls same thing like us
and there's no way to stop it
once you fall in love


i'm glowing
and overflow of happy laughter
i'm growing
closer to you more than ever
i'm blowing
daffodils and kisses, baby breaths, and roses gently
touching noses
i'm sailing
without a destination
i'm sailing
explore uncharted places
i'm exhaling
no more lonely seasons, i'm underwater breathing
drowning in the sea of love


like a train on a track like spokes inside a wheel
involuntary motion like rolling down hill
and there's no way to stop it
it's a natural thing like sunrise and dusk
snowflakes, waterfalls same thing like us
and there's no way to stop it
once you fall in love


i heard a song bird, a seed came through the earth
strangers holding hands, a crowd cheering in the stands
i've already seen all the evidence
it's obvious love's in the air again
saw dark clouds blow, chased by rainbows
saw two roses bloom just like me and you
caught up in the magic i can't pretend
it's obvious love's in the air again

there's no way to stop it, no way
boy you and i
are luv in love you see
that you and i , are luv in love
there's no way to stop it, no way
boy you and i
are luv in love you see
that you and i , are luv in love
