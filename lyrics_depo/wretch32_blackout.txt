When the lights hurt my brain
Sometimes I pray for a blackout
When the candles are placed
Nothing more I crave than a blackout
Let there be no light
Let there be no light, 'til the sunrise
Let there be no light
Only then will I open my eyes
Let there be no light

Is there a light of mine
It's like my peace of mind
Even when I'm in the dark
Still gotta let me shine
Let me fly, my mind's got wings on it
Gotta play that ground, got pink on it
My little bro's got a sixth on it
I splash cash and I drink solid
I don't wanna act bad, don't wanna see a pap' flash
I just wanna black out without backlash
Don't wanna hear snap snap snap, that shit gets annoying
Wanna be alive, not just employed
There, following my heart
Even the light's got faith in the dark, amen

When the lights hurt my brain
Sometimes I pray for a blackout
When the candles are placed
Nothing more I crave than a blackout
Let there be no light
Let there be no light, 'til the sunrise
Let there be no light
Only then will I open my eyes
Let there be no light

Is it that way you move your hips, or that piercing on your lips
Or that there Serrano flowing, like it's serving through a drip
I am no longer a person, I'm a star up in the bitch
So I talk with body language, my vocabulary is shit
Got a feeling that you're feeling how I'm feeling
Would waking up with me tomorrow morning make your evening
If so, let's find a corner in the place that I can breathe in
My ego's claustrophobic, you should know we've had a threesome
Leave it

When the lights hurt my brain
Sometimes I pray for a blackout
When the candles are placed
Nothing more I crave than a blackout
Let there be no light
Let there be no light, 'til the sunrise
Let there be no light
Only then will I open my eyes
Let there be no light

Take away my light
Take away my shine
Take away my eyesight
Give me a beat and let me rhyme

When the lights hurt my brain
Sometimes I pray for a blackout
When the candles are placed
Nothing more I crave than a blackout
Let there be no light
