I forgot just how to feel
City scene ain't no big deal
Soul deep So ya say
None of that takes my breath away
Oh I always seem to see
Both sides when they disagree
And neither one seems right
Too much city life
Is messin' with my inner lite
And everybody's too cool to believe 

I Wasn't Born Yesterday
You should know by now
So let's set the record straight
And we can carry on
I Wasn't Born Yesterday
I'll find out
I ain't innocent
Lots of room for me to doubt
I never learned to cry 

So far so extreme
If I'm jaded, you're naive
but behind that cynic's steady gaze
There's a wide-eyed lover drink for days
Oh I don't want to be
One of those guys who only sees
The joke behind the lie
Too much city life
May I don't know wrong from right
But baby I ain't too cool to believe 

I Wasn't Born Yesterday
I don't die for love
Just let the record speak
Then I carry on
I Wasn't Born Yesterday
I don't die for love
It's never too late to come of age
Never too late
Oh I wanna learn to cry
