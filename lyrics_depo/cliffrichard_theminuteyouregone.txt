The minute you're gone I cry
The minute you're gone I die
Before you walk out of sight
I'm like a child all alone at night

I stare into emptiness
I'm filled with such loneliness
The world goes from right to wrong
The minute you're gone

The minute you're gone I see
How lonely a man I'll be
My life would be oh so blue
If I couldn't be with you

The minute you're gone I pray
The minute you're gone I say
Please don't stay away too long
The minute you're gone
The minute you're gone
