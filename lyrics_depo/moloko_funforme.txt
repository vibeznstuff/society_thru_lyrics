I dreamt that I was dreaming, I was wired to a clock
Tickled by the minute hand, tick tock, tick tick tock
I dream I'm on a train and it is making music
I don't remember getting on, clickity click, clickity click
I dreamt that I was very tall, I was bigger than King Kong
I heard the bells, the bells are ringing, a ding dong, a ding dong
I dream that I am sitting in the devil's company
He gave a solemn promise, fe fi fo, fun for me

I dreamt that I was chasing the monster out of me
I caught him in the corner, ha ha, hee hee hee hee
I dream I'm in a tunnel between here and now
Scooby Doobie, where would you be? bow wow wow wow
I dream I'm at a crossroads, no place left to go
I look in each direction, eenie meanie miny mo
I dream that I am spying, it's you I'm looking at
There's a knocking at the window, a rat tat tat tat, a rat tat tat
I dream I am an ostrich, head deep in the sand
There is a rhythm that's a playing, fantastic elastic band

I dreamt that the bogeyman went down on Mr. Spock
Sugar was a flowing, sock it to 'em sock
I dreamt I saw a moo cow jump across the moon
Just a flight of fantasy, zoom zoom zoom
I dreamt I met a spaceman, he took me to his ship
You know he cut my hair off, snip snip snip
I dreamt that I was sleeping, asleep for heaven's sake
The dream that I was dreaming, it caused me to awake

Fe fi fo, fun for me, fun for me

I dreamt I was way up, I was standing on the top
With the feeling I was falling, bop beep bop
I dreamt that I was jumping in a circus through a hoop
Someone shut the lights off, shoo-be-doop
I dreamt that I was fast, I was never shutting up
I was going in a hurry, I was giddy-up giddy-up
I dream I'm in the park, I'm standing in the nudey
I'm getting what I wanted, tootie fruity tootie fruity

Fe fi fo, fun for me, fun for me

I dreamt that I was dreaming, I was wired to a clock
Tickled by the minute hand, tock tick tock
I dream I'm on a train and it is making music
Don't remember getting on, clickity click
I dreamt that I was very tall, bigger than King Kong
I heard the bells are ringing, a ring ding dong
I dream I am an ostrich, deep in the sand
Rhythm is a playing, elastic band, elastic band

Fe fi fo, fun for me, fun for me
