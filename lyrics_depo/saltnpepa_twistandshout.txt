A sexy girl might ease that antedote to poison
Boys in the jam ask me to dance, but I say no chance
I want a man who's advanced in the art of dance
So when we get on a floor, he can take me on a tour
And we can do it till the fluid or sweat starts to pour
Down like the rain and the thunderstorm hard and strong
Boy, come on, don't wait too long

One good twist deserves a better one, a deffer one
We're Salt and Pepa, together we'll have lots of fun
Do it again, babe, for the hit parade
Cuz Spinderella does a hell of a job keepin' the record playin'
Shout like ya just sold your soul to rock 'n roll
You lost control, go hit the floor
