New York, LA, Tokyo, Berlin, Miami, Rio, Milan, Ibiza - I love all these places but there's no place like home, I love my city!


I go hard in the city of London
I get a lot of love, all smiles when I step in the function
I'm a local boy, I'm from the east side
Now I'm jet setting, I'm reppin, I'll do it worldwide
When I was a kid it was a rough ride
Barely had the money for a bus ride, now I'm on the upside
Having a ball with all the brothers I grew up with
A couple of women I'm in the club with
Bottle of bubbly, feeling lovely women are hugging me
Nobody could tell me nothing and nobody can never trouble me
It's so good, pure positive vibes
For the most part everybody's just tryna live their lives
We're not afraid to die, only the strong survive
You don't know if you don't try, the stakes are high
And it's the city where I earned my crown
God knows that I love this town


The city lights are extra bright
They shine for us tonight
The streets are so alive right now
I fucking love this town
Let me buy you another round
And show you how my peeps get down
The streets are so alive right now
I fucking love this town

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh


It's just one big melting pot,
Every creed color and race, we got the luck
And the love to shop, it's not a brand new coffee cup
No more than a couple of stops
Where should I begin?
Might see me in the west side getting it in
Might see me on the north side getting the trim
Southside to the river in a race car having a spin, I just win
And I'm never gonna lose with the city to guide me
Got the fire but the city inside me and the streets are lively
Got a whole lot of love for connect
It's 7 million people behind me, don't try me
'Cause right now we're gonna rave you up
Set the roof on fire and blaze it up
And we're in it to win it
There's no limit so we raise it up
We're gonna torch this whole place up


The city lights are extra bright
They shine for us tonight
The streets are so alive right now
I fucking love this town
Let me buy you another round
And show you how my peeps get down
The streets are so alive right now
I fucking love this town

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh

I fucking love this town
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
