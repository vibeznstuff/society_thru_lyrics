I said hello to the man that tried to win your hand
A long time ago.
I tried to smile as he talked of the days
When he was your beau,

But I could see he was a-shamin' me
When he talked of his wealth and fame --
Ruby Ann took the hand of this poor, poor man,
Ain't true love a funny thing?

Big man, you got money in your hand,
So what?
You're at a table for two, but still there's only you,
Big shot!
Well, your money can't buy if your power can't hold,
You can't romance your fame --

Ain't true love a funny thing?
