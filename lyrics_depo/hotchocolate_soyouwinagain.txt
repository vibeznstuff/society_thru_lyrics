Just to admit one mistake
That can be hard to take
I know we've made them fall
But only fools come back for more
Being the fool I am
I figured in all your plans, darling
Your perfumed letters didn't say
That you'd be leaving any day

So you win again, you win again
Here I stand again, the loser
And just for fun you took my love and run,
But love had just begun

I can't refuse her
But now I know that I'm the fool
Who won your love to lose it all
When you come back, you win again
And I'm not proud to say
I let love slip away
Now I'm the one who's crying
I'm a fool there's no denying
When will my heartache end?
Will my whole life depend on fading memories
You took the game this time with ease

So you win again, you win again
Here I stand again, the loser
And just for fun you took my love and run,
But love had just begun
