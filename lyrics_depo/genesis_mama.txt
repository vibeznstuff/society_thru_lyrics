I can't see you mama
But I can hardly wait
Ooh to touch and to feel you mama
Oh I just can't keep away
In the heat and the steam of the city
Oh its got me running and I just can't brake
So say you'll help me mama
Cos its getting so hard

Now I can't keep you mama
But I know you're always there
You listen, you teach me mama
And I know inside you care
So get down, down here beside me
Oh you ain't going nowhere
No I won't hurt you mama
But its getting so hard

Can't you see me here mama
Mama mama mama please
Can't you feel my heart
Can't you feel my heart
Can't you feel my heart oh
Now listen to me mama
Mama mama
You're taking away my last chance
Don't take it away
Can't you feel my heart?

It's hot, too hot for me mama
But I can hardly wait
My eyes they're burning mama
And I can feel my body shake
Don't stop, don't stop me mama
Oh make the pain, make it go away
No I won't hurt you mama
But its getting so hard

Now I can't see you mama
But I know you're always there
You taunt, you tease me mama
But I never never never can keep away
It's the heat and the steam of the city
Oh got me running and I just can't brake
So stay don't leave me mama
Cos its getting so hard
