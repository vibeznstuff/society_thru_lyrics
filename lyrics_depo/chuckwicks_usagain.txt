Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

I wanna see the world
I wanna touch your face
I wanna go right there
And never leave that place

I wanna fall back down
I wanna lose the day
I wanna get it back 
In the baddest way

I know it's there
Still see us there
How'd we get away
How'd we get away

Midnight, pick you up
Take you on a slow drive
You and I hanging there
Kissing in the street light
Didn't matter where or when
We just went every time
So tell me will you take me there
Somewhere only you know where
I know we can be better
Than we've ever been
If we could be us again

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Us again
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh

We were a Friday night
After a football game
We were the coolest car
Moving down the interstate

Oh, I know it's there
Still see us there
How'd we get away
How'd we get away

Midnight, pick you up
Take you on a slow drive
You and I hanging there
Kissing in the street light
Didn't matter where or when
We just went every time
So tell me will you take me there
Somewhere only you know where
I know we can be better
Than we've ever been
If we could be us again

Soaked us, deep in love
We would fall every time 
We got back up
So we laid there 
And just lose tonight
So Baby why don't I

Midnight, pick you up
Take you on a slow drive
You and I 
Kissing in the street light
Didn't matter where or when
We went every time, yeah

Midnight, pick you up
Take you on a slow drive
You and I hanging there
Kissing in the street light
Didn't matter where or when
We just went every time
So tell me will you take me there
Somewhere only you know where
I know we can be better
Than we've ever been
If we could be us again

If we can be us again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
