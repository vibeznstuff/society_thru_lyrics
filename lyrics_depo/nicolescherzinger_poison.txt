Got venom dripping from my lips
Know who you're about to kiss
Think that you can handle it, boy, it's on
Just step into the danger zone
Shake it if you wanna roll, never bend,
Just take control, stakes are on

So sick, ill-equipped, gonna stick to a stick
I don't think that I can stop this
Pick it up, let it drop, be my cup, stir it up
Oh no, I'll never stop


That bad girl power I got, I'll abuse it tonight
Cause tonight got poison on my mind
That power I got, you'll be mine when I strive, feel alive
Got poison on my mind
I got that poison (uh huh), I got that poison (uh huh)
I got that poison, that poison on my mind
I got that poison (uh huh), I got that poison (uh huh)
I got that poison, that poison on my mind


So cool out, let her in the scene
Cause tonight I need you clean
My sexy little dirty scream, yeah, it's on
And then I get you in my stream, play it hard to be extreme
You're so cool, baby, you're so mean (Turn me on, turn me on)

So sick, ill-equipped, gonna stick to a stick
I don't think that I can stop this
Pick it up, let it drop, be my cup, stir it up
Oh no, I'll never stop


That bad girl power I got, I'll abuse it tonight
Cause tonight got poison on my mind
That power I got, you'll be mine when I strive, feel alive
Got poison on my mind
I got that poison (uh huh), I got that poison (uh huh)
I got that poison, that poison on my mind
I got that poison (uh huh), I got that poison (uh huh)
I got that poison, that poison on my mind


I got that poison, that poison, that poison
I'll make you fall in love with me
(Turn me on, turn me on)
I got that poison, that poison, that poison
I'll make you fall in love with me
(Turn me on, turn me on)

That bad girl power I got, I'll abuse it tonight
Got poison on my mind
That power I got, you'll be mine, feel alive
Got poison on my mind


That bad girl power I got, I'll abuse it tonight
Cause tonight got poison on my mind
That power I got, you'll be mine when I strive, feel alive
Got poison on my mind
I got that poison (uh huh), I got that poison (uh huh, uh huh)
Got poison on my mind
I got that poison (uh huh), I got that poison (uh huh, uh huh)
Got poison on my mind
