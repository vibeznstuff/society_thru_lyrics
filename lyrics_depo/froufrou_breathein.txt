I - read you - and god i'm good at it - i'm so spot on
Chord - shapes in air - go press that dissonance - if you dare
And you - breathing in - finesse an innocent
From her partying

And i'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
And i'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
Cause i love you no?
Can't help but love, you know...

What - part of no - don't you understand - i've told you before
To just get - off my case - this isn't happening - stop this now
And i - where was i? - i have to be somewhere
Now where did i put it?

And i'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
And i'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
Cause i love you no?
Can't help but love you, no...

Is this it - is this it - is this it?

Yes - hello we're back - and we're taking calls 
Now what was the question?

And i'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
And i'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
Cause i love you no?
Can't help but love you, no...
