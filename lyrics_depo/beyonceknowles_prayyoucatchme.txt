You can taste the dishonesty, it's all over your breath
As you pass it off so cavalier, but even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all, my lonely ear
Pressed against the walls of your world

Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I'm praying to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me

I'm praying to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray you catch me

Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray to catch you whispering {whispering, whispering...}
I pray you catch me {whispering, whispering...}
I pray you catch me
I pray you catch me (praying)
I'm praying you catch me

What are you doin' my love?
