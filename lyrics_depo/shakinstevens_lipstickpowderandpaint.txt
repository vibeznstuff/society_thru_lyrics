Lipstick powder and paint, lipstick powder and paint
Lipstick powder and paint, is you is, or is you ain't
There goes my baby up a tree, a-giggling and a wiggling her toes at me
Let me put my glasses on, haven't had such fun since she's been gone

Lipstick powder and paint, lipstick powder and paint
Lipstick powder and paint, is you is, or is you ain't

Hound dog scratching fleas, looking like she's in love with me
Licks my hand everywhere I go, I wish my baby loved me so

Lipstick powder and paint, lipstick powder and paint
Lipstick powder and paint, is you is, or is you ain't

Taller than the barnyard, ten feet high, hide me till your man pass by
Don't you sneeze and don't you cough, if you get dusty, I'll brush you off

Lipstick powder and paint, lipstick powder and paint
Lipstick powder and paint, is you is, or is you ain't

What kind of love is that you make, the world starts trembling and the building shakes
So love me, hug me once again, let the roof and the walls come tumbling in

Lipstick powder and paint, lipstick powder and paint
Lipstick powder and paint, is you is, or is you ain't

Lipstick powder and paint, lipstick powder and paint
Lipstick powder and paint, is you is, or is you ain't

Lipstick, powder and paint.
