Now I know how to get down on the floor (floor)
Experience in moves you canâ€™t ignore (ignore)
But something bout this beat just got me hooked
Come over here and take a closer look

'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground (whoa)
I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now

It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground 

I do this just for kicks, just for the thrill (thrill)
I got this high without taking a pill (pill)
This groove has got me way over the sun (sun)
I'm dancing like I am the only one (one)

'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground (whoa)
I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now

It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground 

The music's got me going higher
I feel like I can touch the sky

It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
