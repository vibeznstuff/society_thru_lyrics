You got a great car
Yeah, what's wrong with it today?
I used to have one too,
Maybe I'll come and have a look.
I really love
your hairdo, yeah
I'm glad you like mine too,
See what looking pretty cool will get ya?

So, what do you do?
Oh yeah, I wait tables too.
No, I haven't heard your band,
'Cause you guys are pretty new.
But if you dig on vegan food
Well come over to my work
I'll have them cook you
Something that you'll really love.

'cause I like you

and I'm feeling so bohemian like you
Yeah I like you yeah I like you.
And I feel whoa ho woo
Ooh ooh ooh

Wait
Whose that guy
Just hanging at your pad
He's looking kinda bummed
Yeah, you broke up, thats too bad.
I guess it's fair if he always pays the rent
And he doesn't get bent
about sleeping on the couch when I'm there.

'Cause I like you
yeah I like you
And I'm feeling so bohemian like you
Yeah I like you
Yeah I like you
And I feel whoa ho woo!
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

I'm getting wise and
I'm feeling so bohemian like you
It's you that I want, so please
Just a casual, casual easy thing
Is it?

And I like you yeah I like you
and I like you I like you I like you
I like you I like you I like you

Whoa ho woo!
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
