I got what you want so don't go back 
So come and get it let's have some fun 
I wanna show you you're the only one 

He said 'You're too keen' 
I said 'I know what you mean' 
Deep down down inside

Anticipating

I can't disguise it 
I'm so excited 
Ooh ooh ooh yeah

I said 'You wait and see' 
Deep down down inside

I'm so excited 
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
