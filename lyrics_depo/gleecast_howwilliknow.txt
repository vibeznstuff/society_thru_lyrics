There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of, ooh
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above, mmh
Ooh I lose control, can't seem to get enough, uhu
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love, uhu

How will I know
(Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know
How will I know
(Love can be deceiving)
How will I know
How will I know if he really loves me

I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you cause you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is all bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak
Oh, wake me, I'm shaking, I wish I had you near me now
Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love

Oh, tell me
If he loves me, if he loves me
If he loves me, if he loves me not
Ooh, yeah
If he loves me, if he loves me
If he loves me, if he loves me not

Oooh
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is all bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak

How will I know (How will I know if he really loves me)
How will I know (I say a prayer with every heart beat)
How will I know, yeah (I fall in love whenever we meet)
How will I know (I'm asking you cause you know about these things)

How will I know?
