If I'm just a toy you're gonna play with
If I'm not the girl you're gonna stay with
Then don't take all my love
Don't let me give you all my love
Oh, no no no

'Cause I want you to leave a little love in my heart
Yeah, leave a little love so when we part
If I meet someone new, someway, someday
Baby, then I'll have a little love to give to him right away

If I'm just a clown, you're having fun with
You'll just put me down, when I am done with
Well darling, that's ok
But there is one thing I must say
Oh darling, please

Well I want you to leave a little love in my heart
Leave a little love so when we part
If I meet someone new, someway, someday
I'll have a little love to give to him right away

I'll have a little love to give to him right away
