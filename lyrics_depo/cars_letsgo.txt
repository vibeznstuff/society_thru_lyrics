She's driving away
With the dim lights on
And she's making a play
She can't go wrong

She never waits too long

She's winding them down
On her clock machine
And she won't give up
'Cause she's seventeen

She's a frozen fire
She's my one desire
And I don't want to hold her down
Don't want to break her crown
When she says

"Let's go"
I like the nightlife baby
She says
I like the nightlife baby
She says
"Let's go"

She's laughing inside
'Cause they can't refuse
She's so beautiful now
She doesn't wear her shoes

She never likes to choose

She's got wonderful eyes
And a risque mouth
And when I ask her before
She said she's holding out

She's a frozen fire
She's my one desire
And I don't want to hold her down
Don't want to break her crown
When she says

"Let's go"
I like the nightlife baby
She says
I like the nightlife baby
She says
"Let's go"

Ooh
I like the nightlife baby
She says
I like the nightlife baby
She says
"Let's go"
