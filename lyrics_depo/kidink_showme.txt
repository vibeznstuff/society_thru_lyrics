Baby, yeah
Mustard on the beat ho


Baby let me put your panties to the side
I'mma make you feel alright
'Cause I'mma give you what you need, yeah


Mami you remind me of something
But I don't know what it is (I don't know)
Cause you remind me of something
girl, you gotta show me (alright)
you remind me of something
But I don't know what it is right now (I don't know)
Cause you remind me of something
Girl, you gotta show me


Uh, on the real no lie
I don't know what it is but you just my type
Everything just right
B set put it to the left
Don't listen to the hype though
Got a cup in your hand
Baby sitting but you ain't got no kids
We ain't leaving 'til there ain't no more left
Can't see no time on the Rolex
I could tell you a freak, go and show it
Looking for the after party, where to go at?
Go on the floor like a doormat
Baby you know where to throw that
I said




Baby if you know what it is
On the real, can't lie, man just my type
Hands in the air looking for a bitch right now
On the real, can't lie, man just my type


Uh, so tell me what your name is
I don't really care who you came with
Unless you got a couple friends look like you
My bad if my ex try to fight you
Roll up soon as I roll in
Security better get with the program
Too deep, ain't know where to stand
So high, ain't know where to land
You remind me of something missing
Misses, you got my full attention
Listen, let go of the tension
If I get a minute, I put your bad ass in detention








Oh baby show me, show me something
Tomorrow I might be hungover, that don't mean nothing
You see all night long I've been wrong
Baby show me something
You let me do it
