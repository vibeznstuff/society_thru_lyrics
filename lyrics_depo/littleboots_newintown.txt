Heard you're new in town
Want someone to show you round
Well no-one knows this place just quite like me
Well I don't hang with the crowd, where I go we're dressing down
I take you where the music plays for free

So don't rely on people you meet
Cos no-one is safe in these streets

I'm gonna take you out tonight
I'm gonna make you feel alright
I don't have a lot of money but we'll be fine
No I don't have a penny but I'll show you a good time
I'm gonna take you out tonight
I'm gonna make you feel alright
I don't have a lot of money but we'll be fine
No I don't have a penny but I'll show you a real good time

So what do you think so far
Is it all you're hoping for
Does it live up to your every dream
Or do we dissappoint
Well you made the choice
When you wake up can you hear the scream

So don't rely on people you meet
Cos no-one is safe in these streets

I'm gonna take you out tonight
I'm gonna make you feel alright
I don't have a lot of money but we'll be fine
No I don't have a penny but I'll show you a good time
I'm gonna take you out tonight
I'm gonna make you feel alright
I don't have a lot of money but we'll be fine
No I don't have a penny but I'll show you a real good time

Cos I know how it feels to be alone
When strangers only make you feel the cold
You never ever felt so far from home
You never felt so far from home

I'm gonna take you out tonight
I'm gonna make you feel alright
I don't have a lot of money but we'll be fine
No I don't have a penny but I'll show you a good time
I'm gonna take you out tonight
I'm gonna make you feel alright
I don't have a lot of money but we'll be fine
No I don't have a penny but I'll show you a real good time

I'm gonna take you out tonight
I'm gonna make you feel alright
I don't have a lot of money but we'll be fine
No I don't have a penny but I'll show you a good time
I'm gonna take you out tonight
I'm gonna make you feel alright
I don't have a lot of money but we'll be fine
No I don't have a penny but I'll show you a real good time
