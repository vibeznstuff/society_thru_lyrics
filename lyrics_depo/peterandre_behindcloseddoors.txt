You think you've got me figured out
You think you know what I'm about
Don't believe what you read, half of the things you see
Thought you'd figure this out by now

(And who would've known)
That our lives would be so exposed
Where we end up, really nobody knows
What do we know? What do we know?

Behind closed doors
(Behind closed doors) you can't imagine
(Behind closed doors) is where it happens
(Behind closed doors)
That's where the truth is, that's where the lie is, that's where I'm hiding
(Behind closed doors )

There's a man who lives in the street trying to find  his way
In the night life figured he'd find the best way to escape
His addiction cost him everything
Guess he's thought it'd help him hide the pain

(And who would've known)
Has a wife two kids and a three story home
Got all these things yet he's still alone 
What do we know? What do we know?

Behind closed doors
(Behind closed doors) 
(Behind closed doors) 
(Behind closed doors)
(Behind closed doors)
That's where the truth is, that's where the lie is

When you try and you try and no one hears you cry
Deep inside all you hold is the truth
Pay no mind to the lies, keep your eyes on the prize
In the end all you have is you

Behind closed doors, behind closed doors
(Behind closed doors) you can't imagine
(Behind closed doors) is where it happens
(Behind closed doors)
That's where the truth is, that's where the lie is, that's where I'm hiding
(Behind closed doors )
