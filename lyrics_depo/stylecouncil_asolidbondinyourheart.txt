Feel is a word I can't explain
At least not in words that are plain
Make it easy to express
But I'll try to do my best
To hit you where it counts
I just want to build up
A solid bond in your heart
(Yeah) A solid bond in your heart (Aha)

I'm fuelled by the idea
That this world was made to share
But it never seems to work out
And all we seem to share
Is doubt and misery
I just want to build up
A solid bond in your heart heart

When you feel in your soul
And your heart begins to blow
Keep it in mind to
Keep on trying

It's like a feeling deep inside
Please don't ever try to hide
That solid bond in your heart

(Yeah) A solid bond in your heart (Aha)

Aah, I just want to build up
A solid bond in your heart heart
It's what's missing from this life
And the trust you need to ignite
Any dream worth holding dear
When that dream is so near

You gotta try and try to get it back
Push it to the limit and build
A solid bond in your heart
