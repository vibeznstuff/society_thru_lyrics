And these leafy mysteries
And the silence of the eve
And in the shady tree's I swing
&amp; in the dappled orchards heat
Where I lie &amp; wait
Wait for the breeze
To carry me

To a place I can lose myself
No time just somewhere else
With a face I can recognise
-I forget sometimes
That's always been here

And all these leafy mysteries
&amp; the changing of the seas
&amp; all the secrets of the tide
Just open up the world I find-
So small to me
When there's so much to see
