Is that it? Is that it? Is that it? 

Is that it? You gone and turned me loose
I guess my face don't fit, baby is that it?

You pick me up and you put me down
You're so proud of it, baby is that it?

People all about me talk about love-yeah
Just don't bother asking 
What they're thinkin' of-yeah

Is that it? Is that it?
Guess my face don't fit, baby is that it?

Que sera sera, give us the keys to your car
This time I'm gonna split now, baby is that it?

Is that it? Is that it? Is that it? Is that it? Hey -

People all about me talk about love-yeah
Just don't bother asking
What they're thinkin' of-yeah

Is that it? Is that it?
Guess my face don't fit, baby is that it?

Guess my face don't fit, baby is that it?

Is that it? Is that it? Is that it? 

Guess I'll say 'bye 'bye - baby, baby - 'bye 'bye!
