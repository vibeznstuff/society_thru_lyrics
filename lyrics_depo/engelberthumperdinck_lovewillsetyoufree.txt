So graceful and pure, a smile bathed in light
No matter the distance a mirical of sight,
Though I should have known, I could not turn away
But faced with your beauty, no reason can stay

As you kiss him in the moonlight, with heavy words I say 
If you love someone, follow your heart
'Cause love comes once if you're lucky enough
Though I'll miss you forever, the hurt will run deep
Only love can set you free.

Trust in your dreams, run with no fear
And if you should stumble, remember I'm near
As a ghost I will walk, I'll look deep in my soul
I might find another, you gave me that hope

So as you kiss him in the moonlight, with heavy words I say
If you love someone, follow your heart
Because love comes once if you're lucky enough
Though I'll miss you forever, and the hurt will run deep
Only love can set you free

And if you love someone, follow your heart
'Cause love comes once if you're lucky enough
Though I'll miss you forever, the hurt will run deep
Love will set you free
