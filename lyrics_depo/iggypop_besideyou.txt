I been hungry way down in my heart
waiting for a reason
i been hungry like a lot of guys
i want to be beside you
lonely people pass me in the street
waiting for a reason
beslde you
grey is turning to blue
you wake up loye in me
beslde you
everything is new
you wake up love in me
i been hungry way down where it hurts
waiting for a reason
i been hungry like a lot of guys
i wanna be beside you
beslde you
grey is turnin to blue
you wake up love in me
beside you
everything is new
you wake up love in me
what a world
i really need you girl
you wake up love in me
beside you
grey is turning to blue
you wake up loye in me
beside you beside you
i want to be beside you
