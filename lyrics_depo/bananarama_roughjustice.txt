The young don't grow up 
Well not in this life 
Big mouths and money 
Win every time 
Boy beats girl 
While the sneaky and snide 
Take all your money 
And take your pride 

Innocent people walking by 
No time to smile before they die 
Don't call that justice 
Children are starving on the street 
Another one disappearing every week 
Don't call that justice 

King for a day 
But their kingdom grows cold 
They'll never grow up 
But they're bound to grow old 
I remember the pain 
And humiliation 
And I'll show them rough justice 
The way that they did 

Innocent people walking by 
No time to smile before they die 
Don't call that justice 
Children are starving on the street 
Another one disappearing every week 
Don't call that justice 

Innocent people walking by 
No time to smile before they die 
Don't call that justice 
Children are starving on the street 
Another one disappearing every week 
Don't call that justice 

Boy beats girl 
While the sneaky and snide 
Take all your money 
And take your pride 

Innocent people walking by 
No time to smile before they die 
Don't call that justice 
Children are starving on the street 
Another one disappearing every week 
Don't call that justice 

Innocent people walking by 
No time to smile before they die 
Don't call that justice 
Children are starving on the street 
Another one disappearing every week 
Don't call that justice 

Don't call that justice...
