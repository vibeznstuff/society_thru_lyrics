Do you remember when we were two beautiful birds
We would light up the sky when we'd fly
You were orange and red like the sun when it sets
I was green as an apple's eye
You said you loved all the songs that I'd sing
Like nothing that you'd ever heard
And I said I loved you with all of my heart
When we were two beautiful birds

Do you remember when we were two beautiful birds
We'd sing when the morning would come
You were silver and blue like the moon when its new
I was gold as a summer sun

One day you asked for a different song
One that I just couldn't sing
I got the melody sharp and the words all wrong
Those were the last days of spring

To build a nest we pecked feathers from our chests
Like a book tearing out every page
We weren't to know that these feathers would grow
In to a beautiful cage
