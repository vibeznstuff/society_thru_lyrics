
Ah, the name of this song is Uncle Sam goddamn
It's a show tune but the show ain't been written for it yet
We're gonna see if Tony Jerome and the band can maybe work this shit out for
me
And straighten me out right quick
I like it so far man
...Yeah, come on, lets go


Welcome to the United Snakes
Land of the thief home of the slave
Grand imperial guard where the dollar is sacred and proud
Lets do this shit for real, come on now


Smoke and mirrors, stripes and stars
Stolen for the cross in the name of God
Bloodshed, genocide, rape and fraud
Written to the pages of the law good lord
The Cold Continent latch key child
Ran away one day and started acting foul
King of where the wild things are daddy's proud
cos the Roman Empire done passed it down
Imported and tortured a work force
and never healed the wounds or shook the curse off
Now the grown up Goliath nation
Holdin open auditions for the part of David, can you feel it?
Nothing can save ya, you question the reign
You get rushed in and chained up
Fist raised but I must be insane
cos I can't figure a single goddamn way to change it


Welcome to the United Snakes
Land of the thief home of the slave
The grand imperial guard where the dollar is sacred and power is God


All must bow to the fat were lazy
The fuck you obey me and why do they hate me (who me?)
Only two generations away
from the world's most despicable slavery trade
Pioneered so many ways to degrade a human being
that it can't be changed to this day
Legacy so ingrained in the way that we think we no longer need chains
to be slaves
Lord it's a shameful display
The overseers even got raped along the way
Cause the children cant escape from the pain
and they're born with poisoness hatred in their veins
Try n' separate a man from his soul
you only strengthen him and lose your own
But shoot that fucker if he walk near the throne
Remind him that this is my home (now I'm gone)



Hold up give me one right here
Hold on


You don't give money to the bums
on a corner with a sign bleeding from their gums
Talking about you don't support a crackhead
What you think happens to the money from your taxes
Shit the governments an addict
With a billion dollar a week kill brown people habit
And even if you aint on the front line
when massah yell crunch time you right back at it
Plain look at how you hustling backwards
At the end of the year add up what they subtracted
Three outta twelve months your salary pays for that madness
Man, that's savage
What's left get a big ass plasma
To see where they made Dan Rather point the damn camera
Only approved questions get answered
Now stand your ass up for that national anthem

Custom made (You're so low)
To consume the noose (You're so low)
Keep saying we're free (You're so low)
But we're all just loose (You're so low)
