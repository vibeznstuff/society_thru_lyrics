Yeah (yeah) yeah


It's your birthday so I know you want to ride out
Even if we only go to my house
Sip more weezy as we sit upon my couch
Feels good but I know you want to cry out

You say you want passion (I think you found it)
Get ready for action (don't be astounded)
We switching positions (you feel surrounded)
Tell me where you want your gift girl

Girl you know I, I, I 
I've been feening
Woke up in the late night been dreaming about your loving
Girl you know I, I, I 
Don't need candles and cake
Just need your body to make good

Birthday sex 
It's the best day of the year girl
Birthday sex 
If hes not, he's not, lemme hit that g-spot, g-spot girl


See you sexy in them jeans got me on ten
1,2,3, think I got you pinned
Don't tap out fighting 'til the end
Ring that bell and we gone start over again

We grinding with passion
'Cause it's your birthday
Been at it for hours
I know you thirsty
You kiss me so sweetly
Taste just like Hershey's
Just tell me how you want your gift girl

Girl you know I, I, I 
I've been feening
Woke up in the late night been dreaming about your loving
Girl you know I, I, I 
Don't need candles and cake
Just need your body to make good

Birthday sex 
It's the best day of the year girl
Birthday sex 
If hes not, he's not, lemme hit that g-spot, g-spot girl

First I'm gonna take a dive into the water
Deep until I know I please that body, body (aooh)
Or girl without a broom I might just sweep you off your feet
And make you wanna tell somebody, somebody (how I do)

Or maybe we can float on top my water bed (bed)
You close your eyes as I end prop. between your legs (your legs)
We work our way from kitchen stoves and tables
Girl you know I'm more than able to please... Yeah

You say you wanted flowers on the bed
But you got me and hours on the bed

Girl you know I, I, I 
I've been feening
Woke up in the late night been dreaming about your loving
Girl you know I, I, I 
Don't need candles and cake
Just need your body to make good

Birthday sex 
It's the best day of the year girl
Birthday sex 
If hes not, he's not, lemme hit that g-spot, g-spot girl
