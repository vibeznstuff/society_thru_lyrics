Summertime, summertime.
Get up in the morning, I'm going after mine.
I never fell in love, I wouldn't waste my time.
But when I met you, I had to change my mind.
No lieeee.
You wasn't even on the radar, sailing on my own living life like sailor.
V, what ever do with me, take me I put my anchor down, ain't calling home but lately.
I'm just trying to make amends and; baby I got the Benz (oh nooo).
It's easy to get capsized, when you living my life, when you moving at night.
So when the nights go out in Broadway.
There's no one left out, you can go and call me, we skip all the foreplay stop in the hallway,
It's the shit I been thinking about all day (all day).
So before you drift away...

Throw your anchor down, and stay with me tonight.
Throw your anchor down, and lay with me tonight.
Throw your anchor down (down), stay with me tonight.
Till the morning light.

Black shades, black dress black, heart (car).
Red lipstick, tattoos of a star running down your forearm, a silver lock charm with a picture of your mom,
And you got the world by the balls (oh lord).
Don't even know where to begin, I'm three sheets at the wind, LSD in my gin, everyone got there cup,
But they ain't chipped in, I fell right in even if I can't swim
I'm just trying to make a man zane, baby I got the Benz (oh nooo).
I think I'm drowning.
I'm over my head, and nothing settle downed there with magnets for some trouble.
Showing up the shovel, then looking like the devil, but no one does it better.
So forget about who ever and tonight will be forever (ever).
Before you drift away...

Throw your anchor down, and stay with me tonight.
Throw your anchor down, and lay with me tonight.
Throw your anchor down (down), stay with me tonight.
Till the morning light.
