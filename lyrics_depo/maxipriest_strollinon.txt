Strollin' on, strollin' on
Strollin' along with my girl
Holding her by her hand

See it's a feelin'
Which you've gotta experience for yourself
Lord it's a feelin' you have
When you're strollin' along with your girl

Thinking of things
Of things gone long by
All the times we spend
When we're strollin' along together
Yes I'm strollin' on
Yes I'm strollin' on

Strolling with my girl
Holding her by, holding her by her hand

Strollin' on on on, yeah oh yeah

Strolling with my girl
Holding her by, holding her by her hand

See in the country
Flowers, the cool breeze
The wind in her hair
Seems so sweet to me

So when you're in love
And she loves you too
Hand in hand, feelin' the vibes flow through
So when I kissed her lips
So soft so sweet as honey
Strollin' along with a beautiful girl like her
Cause I'm strollin' on
Yes I'm strollin' on

Strolling with my girl
Holding her by, holding her by her hand
