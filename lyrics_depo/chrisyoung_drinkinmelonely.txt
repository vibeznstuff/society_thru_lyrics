I'm pushing you away each time I pull up that ol' barstool
Drownin' you in every drop I drink
Telling you to go to hell but I'm talking to myself
'Cause you're not around to hear what I think

I'm trying to teach my heart to hate you but it ain't workin' right
Now the truth is I'm only drinkin' me lonely tonight

And Lord, it's more than just thirsty that I'm feeling inside
'Cause these tears I've been crying have left me bone dry
I wish the bartender had a cure I could buy
But the truth is I'm only drinkin' me lonely tonight

You said I'd have to choose between your love and this old bar room
I just laughed but I guess you knew best
Who cares who's right or wrong tonight, my better half is gone
And this whiskey's laying claim to all that's left

So I'll just order up another and pretend I'm all right
When the truth is I'm only drinkin' me lonely tonight

And Lord, it's more than just thirsty that I'm feeling inside
'Cause these tears I've been crying have left me bone dry
I wish the bartender had a cure I could buy
But the truth is I'm only drinkin' me lonely tonight

So I'll just order up another and pretend I'm all right
When the truth is I'm only drinkin' me lonely tonight
