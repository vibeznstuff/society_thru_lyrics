Do you remember the night in September
The two of us laid in the hay
Do you remember the day in December
And how we got carried away


If you're in for a penny
You gotta be in for a pound
Oo 'Cos over and over
You play me that old fashioned sound
So look around. Play the refrain
Play it and play it and play it again...

Did you discover that Oo I'm a lover
When we took a tumble or two
Where you surprised when you tried me for size
You bit off more than you could chew



Do you remember the night I surrendered
You wanted to paint me in oils
Owh you are tender do you remember
The sleepers could hear me for miles
