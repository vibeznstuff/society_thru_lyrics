Thought I'd stop by awhile and see you
Just once more before I leave town
But his car's parked there in your driveway
And I see the curtain's pulled down.

I won't bother to ring your doorbell
I'm not sure just how much I can bear
I might do something I'd be sorry for later
So I won't come in while he's there.

Does he know my whole world is in there with him
That he's king while he sits there in my chair
I'd like to tell you just how much I still love you
But I won't come in while he's there.

No, I won't come in while he's there...
