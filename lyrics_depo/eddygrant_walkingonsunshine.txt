Oh, do it, do it
Oh, do it, do it

Looking through the morning dew
At smokey mountains, nothing new
Lead me to the mountain top
And we'll work until it's time to stop

Oh baby, you're mine, you're mine
You're walking on sunshine
(And I) got to tell you that you doing fine
Walking on sunshine
Oh
(And I got to) tell you that you're doing fine
Walking on sunshine

Oh, living isn't everything
But you know the feeling love can bring
I said when you're floating through your cloud
Baby don't you shout too loud

Oh darlin'

I said that you're mine, you're mine, oh
You're walking on sunshine
(And I) got to tell you that you doing fine
Walking on sunshine
Oh
(I got to) tell you that you're doing fine
Walking on sunshine
Oh

That's right, get there
(Oh baby) everybody (yeah)
