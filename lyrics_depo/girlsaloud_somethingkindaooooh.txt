I've got to heat it up 
Doctor, got to heat it up 
I've got till 3 o'clock 
I've got to rock until you drop 

Till you drop...something..ahh 

Something kinda ooh, 
Jumping on my toot-toot
Something 'side of me, 
Wants some part of you oo-ooh 

Something kinda ooh, 
Makes my heart go boom boom 
Something 'side of me, 
Wanting what you do oo-ooh 

Something kinda ooh, 
Jumping on my toot-toot 
Something 'side of me, 
Wants some part of you oo-ooh 

Something kinda ooh, 
Bumping in the back room, 
Something 'side of me, 
Wanting what you do oo-ooh 

Ooh, when tomorrow comes 
Baby I won't even known your name 
Baby so good 
Want to follow on by 
But I'll never meet you 
Never see you again 

If you wanna put a (or pin a) line on me, now no 
Wait till the band gonna play real slow 
If you want your hands on me 
I'm digging you up 

Cant dance - no pain, no gain, no show 
Jump to the beat all night dont roll 
If you wanna handle me 
You got to keep up 

Something kinda ooh, 
Jumping on my toot-toot
Something 'side of me, 
Wants some part of you oo-ooh 

Something kinda ooh, 
Makes my heart go boom boom 
Something 'side of me, 
Wanting what you do oo-ooh 

Something kinda ooh, 
Jumping on my toot-toot
Something 'side of me, 
Wants some part of you oo-ooh 

Something kinda ooh, 
Bumping in the back room, 
Something 'side of me, 
Wanting what you do oo-ooh 

I've got to heat it up 
Doctor, got to heat it up 
I've got till 3 o'clock 
I've got to rock until you drop 
 

Oh boy, I can't tell you how sad I feel 
And tonight, is just another kink in your steel 
(Oh yeah) 

Shoulda known where the man was at 
Shoulda known he was coming to make me 
I shoulda recognised the plan of attack 
When he turned and he called me Baby 

Shoulda known where the man was at 
Shoulda known he was coming to make me 
Shoulda come with a party rap 
So I know where the night would take me 

Take me...something...(take me)... 

Something kinda ooh, 
Jumping on my toot-toot 
Something 'side of me, 
Wants some part of you oo-ooh 

Something kinda ooh, 
Makes my heart go boom boom 
Something 'side of me, 
Wanting what you do oo-ooh 

Something kinda ooh, 
Jumping on my toot-toot
Something 'side of me, 
Wants some part of you oo-ooh 

Something kinda ooh, 
Bumping in the back room, 
Something 'side of me, 
Wanting what you do oo-ooh
