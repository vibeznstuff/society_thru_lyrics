I don't want to believe what they're telling me;
Somebody's been picking in my cherry tree.
I don't want to mistrust somebody by mistake.
Somebody's been digging 'round in my cake.


And I ain't gonna stand for it, baby.
I ain't gonna stand for it, baby.
I ain't gonna stand for it, baby, nah nah.
I ain't gonna stand for it, baby.
I ain't gonna stand for it, baby.
I ain't gonna stand for it, baby, nah nah, nah nah.

I don't want to believe what somebody said;
Somebody said somebody's shoe was under my bed.
I don't want to cause nobody no bodily harm.
Somebody's been rubbing on my good luck charm.



Oh, my my my my my my.
Oh, my my my my my my.
Oh, my my my my my my.
Oh, my my my my my my.
