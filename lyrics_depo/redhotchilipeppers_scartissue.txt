Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know it all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share...

With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Fallin' all over myself
To lick your heart and taste your health
'Cause with the birds I'll share this lonely view...

With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Blood loss in a bathroom stall
A southern girl with a scarlet drawl
Wave good-bye to ma and pa
'Cause with the birds I'll share...

With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl
Autumn's sweet we call it fall
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl
And with the birds I'll share this lonely view...

With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know it all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share...

With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view...
