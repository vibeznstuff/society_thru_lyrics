Lady
Hear me tonight
'Cos my feeling
Is just so right
As we dance
By the moonlight
Can't you see
You're my delight

Lady
I just feel like
I won't get you
Out of my mind
I feel loved
For the first time
And I know that it's true
I can tell by the look in your eyes

Lady
Hear me tonight
'Cos my feeling
Is just so right
As we dance
By the moonlight
Can't you see
You're my delight

Lady
I just feel like
I won't get you
Out of my mind
I feel loved
For the first time
And I know that it's true
I can tell by the look in your eyes

Lady
Hear me tonight
'Cos my feeling
Is just so right
As we dance
By the moonlight
Can't you see
You're my delight

Lady
I just feel like
I won't get you
Out of my mind
I feel loved
For the first time
And I know that it's true
I can tell by the look in your eyes

Lady
Hear me tonight
'Cos my feeling
Is just so right

Lady
I just feel like
I feel loved
For the first time

Lady
Hear me tonight
Can't you see
You're my delight
