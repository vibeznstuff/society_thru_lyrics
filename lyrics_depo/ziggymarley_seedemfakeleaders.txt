See dem fake leaders
In the place of power they sit
From religion to politics
Riding a wave of fear
Starting fire, they don't care
Making enemies out of friends
Killing thousands, hundreds, and tens
If only they could lead
The world to peace and prosperity

See dem fake leaders
Now let me explain it real quick
'Cos the system full of dem tricks
And there is something you just can't miss
No matter what you think you're fighting for
To make rich those who profit from war
Look what they're doing to us people
If only they could lead
The world to love and unity

Now I have seen where we will be
And what's good for all of humanity
Not ruled by bastions of supremacy
Or ideologies of bigotry
Some people live in their bubbles
Some people live behind their walls
Some people taken for granted
Some people taken advantage of

Now we will have to lead
The world to peace and prosperity
Yeah we will have to lead
The world to love and unity

'Cos dem fake leaders
In the place of power they sit
From religion to politics
Riding a wave of fear
Starting fire, they don't care
Making enemies out of friends
Killing thousands, hundreds, and tens
Now only we can lead
The world to peace and prosperity
