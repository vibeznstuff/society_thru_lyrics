Home for seven days and I haven't even seen your face
I guess I've got a flight to change
There ain't nothin' left to say

If you really don't have it figured out by now
There's no need for me to hang around
I've gotta get out of town

Five dollar drink and a lonely window seat
Half empty plane on New Years Eve
Love birds in the row in front of me are driving me crazy
The pilot comes on, says the year is almost gone
Five, four, three, two, one
Looks like it's just me and the whiskey
Cause you ain't here to kiss me
You ain't here to kiss me

Raise a toast to the thought of you and me
This was just the way it had to be
90 proof to give me clarity
The flight attendant must know that somethings going on
Can't hide the look of love gone wrong
So she's pouring them a little strong

Five dollar drink and a lonely window seat
Half empty plane on New Years Eve
Love birds in the row in front of me are driving me crazy
The pilot comes on, says the year is almost gone
Five, four, three, two, one
Looks like it's just me and the whiskey
Cause you ain't here to kiss me
You ain't here to kiss me

At least we had a chance to know how it feels to love
But it turns out love ain't always enough
So I'll start getting over you

With another five dollar drink and a lonely window seat
Half empty plane on New Years Eve
Love birds in the row in front of me just like we used to be
The pilot comes on, says the year is almost gone
Five, four, three, two, one
Looks like it's just me and the whiskey
Cause you ain't here to kiss me yeah
You ain't here to kiss me
You ain't here to kiss me
