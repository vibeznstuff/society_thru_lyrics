Oh, no I can't write my name
Don't you know I'm so blasted
This revelation it is hotter
Than a matchhead
And I'm ready to go
Ready to fly away with you
And I may lose everything
But I don't give a damn if I do


Never been in love,
Never been in love,
Never been in love,
I've never been in love like this before

This good luck
It's breaking out of bounds
And I just got to tell it, tell it
Oh scream and shout
You came like a hurricane
And sent me into the clouds
And I haven't seen my feet for days
Cause I'm miles above the ground



Who says I need a doctor
Just 'cause I'm acting half crazed?
I've been laughing so much
Oh they want to put me away
And I'm really gonna take this chains of my life
Yeah, yeah
Cause this lightning I know
It will never strike twice
