All the signs were there for me to see
If I cry out with fear I'll feel more afraid
So beat the sense back into me
'Cos you are like forbidden fruit out of my reach
And I forgot what I had sometimes

But if everyone has their shot and moves on
And you can't get out the way
Well, it's you, wonder will save

You were mine and now you're mine to want
And I knew if you'd cut the cord
And rushed like balloons I'd fall
It's criminal to pause
As you basked in the season of I had it all
And I forgot what I had sometimes

But if everyone has their shot and moves on
And you can't get out the way
And it's all for the best, it's all alive
And everyone has their day

'Cos if everyone has their shot and moves on
And you just get in the way
Well, it's you, wonder will save

La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la

Don't let them make you feel small
With their hands like guns at your head
They'll claw but they'll never win if you let wonder in

'Cos if everyone has their shot and moves on
And you can't get out the way
And it's all for the best, it's all alive
And everyone has their day

'Cos if everyone has their shot and moves on
And you can't get out the way
Well, it's you, wonder will save

'Cos if everyone has their shot and moves on
And you can't get out the way
And it's all for the best, it's all alive
And everyone has their day

But if everyone has their shot and moves on
And you can't get out the way
Well, it's you, wonder will save
Yeah, it's you, wonder will save
Yeah, it's you, wonder will save
