Just look at that girl
She knows the world owes her something
And she's alright
Just look at that girl
She knows she's got that something
And she's alright
She's got diamond rings from her dad
She's got fancy things from her dad
All the world it wants this lady
All the world it wants her

So nice in Nice, so nice and neat
So nice in Nice, so nice and neat

Just look at that girl
She owns the ground she walks on
And she'll walk all over you
Just look at that girl
She smiles and breaks your heart
There's nothing you can do
She's got diamond rings from her dad
She's got fancy things from her dad
All the world it wants my baby
All the world it wants her

So nice in Nice, so nice and neat
So nice in Nice, so nice and neat
Don't tell me lies
You can't support
I wouldn't believe you
I wouldn't believe at all
Even if I saw

Just look at that girl
Where once she wore leather jackets
Now she's wearing furs
Just look at that girl
She walks around owning everything
That's not even hers
She's got diamond rings from her dad
She's got fancy things from her dad
All the world it wants my baby
All the world it wants her

So nice in Nice, so nice and neat
So nice in Nice, so nice and neat

She walks straight ahead
And walks all over you
She smiles and breaks you heart
But that's OK
