I left out in a cloud of tail lights and dust
Swore I wasn't comin' back
Said I'd had enough

Saw you in the rearview standin'
Fadin' from my life
But I wasn't turnin' round
No not this time

But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey

Don't think I dont wonder 'bout
Could've been should've been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it

When we make choices we gotta live with them
Heard ya found a real good man and ya married him
I wonder sometimes if I cross your mind
Where would we be today
If I never drove that car away

But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey

Don't think I dont wonder 'bout
Could've been should've been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it

Don't think I don't think about it

But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think you don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey

On't think I dont wonder 'bout
Could've been should've been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it

No no

Don't think I don't

Don't think I don't
Mmmmmhhhhmmm
