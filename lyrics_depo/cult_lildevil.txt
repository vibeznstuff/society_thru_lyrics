Yeah

Livin' in a shack in a one-horse town
Trying to get to heaven 'fore the sun goin' down
Lizard in a bottle, yeah

Dizzy in a haze for 40 days
Hey there, little devil

Come on little devil
Be my little angel
Come on little devil
Be my, yeah, angel, ow

Oh, she came on with an alligator smile
Dynamite lover, scorpion child
Trying to get to heaven 'fore the sun goes down, yeah

She came on with a cyclone kiss
Hey there baby, you don't never miss
Lizard in a bottle, oh yeah

Come on little devil
Be my little angel
Come on little devil
Be my little angel, angel

Come on little devil
Be my little angel
Come on little devil
Be my, oh be my, angel
