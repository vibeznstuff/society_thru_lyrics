Paradise is what you're looking for
Paradise is what you're looking for

Are you looking for some place you can be free
Are you looking, looking for someone you want to be
You ran away from home girl - searching for your Shangri-la
Wherever you may roam girl in my mind you won't be far

Paradise is what you're looking for
Paradise is what you're looking for

You're a prisoner inside a gilded cage
You keep praying sayin' there must be a better way
You've got the best intentions of this I don't have any doubts
I can't help but to mention don't you know what life's about

Paradise is what you're looking for
Paradise is what you're looking for

Paradise is what you're looking for
Paradise is what you're looking for

Paradise is what you're looking for
Paradise is what you're looking for
