If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm.
I used up all of my tricks,
I hope that you like this.
But you probably won't.
You think you're cooler than me.

You got designer shades,
Just to hide your face
And you wear them around like you're cooler than me.
And you never say "Hey"
Or remember my name,
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me.

You got your high brow,
Shoes on your feet,
And you wear them around
Like they ain't shit.
But you don't know the way that you look,
When your steps make that much noise.

Shh I got you all figured out,
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen.
Behind your make-up nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?

If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm.
I used up all of my tricks,
I hope that you like this.
But you probably won't.

You got designer shades
Just to hide your face
And you wear them around like you're cooler than me.
And you never say "Hey"
Or remember my name.
It's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me.

You got your high brow,
Switch in your walk,
And you don't even look when you pass by.
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise.
Shh.

I got you all figured out,
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen.
Behind your make-up nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?

'Cause it sure seems ('cause it sure seems)
You got no doubts (that you got no doubts)
But we all see (we all see)
You got your head in the clouds

If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm.
I used up all of my tricks,
I hope that you like this.

And you wear them around like you're cooler than me.
