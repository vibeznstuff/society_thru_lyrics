I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming but
There's a voice inside my head sayin',
You'll never reach it,
Every step I'm taking, 
Every move I make feels
Lost with no direction
My faith is shaking

But I
Got to keep trying
Got to keep my head held high

There's always going to be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always going to be an uphill battle, 
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose,
Ain't about how fast I get there,
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

The struggles I'm facing,
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down but
No I'm not breaking
I may not know it
But these are the moments that
I'm going to remember most yeah
Just got to keep going

And I, 
I got to be strong
Just keep pushing on, cause

There's always going to be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle, 
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose, 
Ain't about how fast I get there, 
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb (yeah)

There's always going to be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle, 
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose, 

There's always going to be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle, 
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose, 
Ain't about how fast I get there, 
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

There's always going to be another mountain (Keep the faith)
I'm always gonna wanna make it move (Keep your faith)
Always gonna be an uphill battle, 
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose, 
Ain't about how fast I get there, 
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side

It's the climb
