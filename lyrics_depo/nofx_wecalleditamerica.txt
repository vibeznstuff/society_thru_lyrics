"The leads are weak."
"The leads are weak; fucking leads are weak? You're weak."

Remember when America had a middle class and an upper class? 
That was way before the exodus.
That was the America that we thought was number one, 
thought would overcome, thought would never die.
That was just our pride and faith: two shitty deadly sins; 
I know faith isn't one of 'em but it should have been,
'Cause when things were crumbling, we had no camaraderie, 
just a faith someone would save us from despondence.

We called it America, whoa.
We called it America, whoa.

"Number one America" was a slogan used 
to keep morale up when we knew we were already cooked,
Then the richer western states 
succeeded in secession and the eastern ones followed right behind.
Mexi-Can-America was the perfect name 
that epitomized the order of significance, authority and affluence.
We had turned it all around, went from number one, straight to number two (shit).

We called it America, whoa.
We called it America, whoa.

National bankruptcy, circumcised society.
USA, dined and ditched; 
Fox reports "poor is the new rich".

We called it America, whoa.
We called it America, whoa.
We called it America, whoa.
We called it America, whoa.
We called it America.
