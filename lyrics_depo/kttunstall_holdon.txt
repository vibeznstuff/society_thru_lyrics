Say you to me
You're a bird with an eye for anything shiny
Searchin' the land
For a hero of a man
You say I need
More than my fair share of attention
But I think you know
That just isn't so

Underneath, I felt the fire of a burning question
Tearin' me apart
Right from the very start
And now I see
That it don't take a trick of the light to excite me
So strong
So long
You'll see

Hold on
To what you
Been given lately
Hold on
To what you
Know you got
Hold on
To what you
Been given lately
Hold on
Cause the world will turn if you're ready or not

Simplicity
A heart of gold, an old head, and young shoulders
Quiet and lovely
Becomin' part of me
And now I see
From a handful of names and a thousand faces
One light, burnin', furiously

I was tired of January
I was tired of June
I felt a change a-comin'
Oh, I was tired of January
Tired of June
I felt a change a-comin'
Oh, I felt a change a-comin
I felt a change a-comin
felt a change a-comin, soon

Hold on
To what you
Been given lately
Hold on
To what you
Know you got
Hold on
To what you
Been given lately
Hold on
Cause the world will turn if you're ready or not

Oh yeah, well the world will turn if you're ready or not
Oh, yes the world will turn if you're ready or not
