You know I'll miss you 
When you're gone 
And I can't pretend 
That I know when 
Our love started to go wrong 

I know we planned to stay together 
We just ran into stormy weather 
We couldn't see the dark clouds in the sky 

But I had no way of knowing 
And I don't know where I'm going 
But I'm movin' on 

We talked it over 
We've said it all 
But who could say 
It would be this way 
But the writing's on the wall 

And now the sun has finally set and 
This is where the story ends we 
Didn't count upon a rainy day 

But I had no way of knowing 
And I don't know where I'm going 
But I'm movin' on 

But I had no way of knowing 
And I don't know where I'm going 
But I'm movin' on 

I'm movin' on 

I'm movin' on 

I know we planned to stay together 
We just ran into stormy weather 
We couldn't see the dark clouds in the sky

But I had no way of knowing 
And I don't know where I'm going 
But I'm movin' on 

But I had no way of knowing 
And I don't know where I'm going 
But I'm movin' on 

I'm movin' on 

But I had no way of knowing 
And I don't know where I'm going 
But I'm movin' on
