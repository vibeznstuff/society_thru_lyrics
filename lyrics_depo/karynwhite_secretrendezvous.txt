Happiness is when I, I think of you,
And we'll be gettin' together for a rendez-vous,
I'll be on time, you bring the wine,
And when we lock the door, you'll be all mine...
Alone in my room, thoughts of you in my head as I wait...
The time is soon, you'll arrive, together then,
We'll escape into the night on wings of love,
And do the things that we onced dreamed of...
All aboard a luxury, a first class ticket to ecstasy...

It won't stop! It don't stop! A non-stop secret rendez-vous!
It won't stop! It don't stop! A non-stop secret rendez-vous!
Hey, hey, hey! Oh, oh, oh!

From a penthouse view, we'll make love, drink champagne by the candlelight...
I'm so glad I'm in your arms, baby I am yours tonight!
To be with you is all I need, so lock the door and throw away the key!
No one will disturb this groove, we could not stop it if we wanted to!

It won't stop! It don't stop! A non-stop secret rendez-vous!
It won't stop! It don't stop! A non-stop secret rendez-vous!
Hey, hey, hey! Oh, oh, oh!
Secret rendez-vous!

Happiness is when I, I think of you,
And we'll be gettin' together for a rendez-vous...
I'll be on time, you bring the wine,
And when we lock the door, you'll be all mine...

I want you! Do you want me? We're gon' lock the door, throw away the key, ecstasy, yeah!
(It won't stop!) No, (It don't stop!) Baby!
(A non-stop secret rendez-vous!)
(It won't stop! It don't stop!) I just wanna be with you...
(A non-stop secret rendez-vous!)
(Oh-oo-oh! Oh-oh-oo-oh! Oh-oo-oh! Secret rendez-vous!)

I wanna rendez-vous by the candlelight,
I wanna hug and squeeze you through the night...
So lock the door, throw away the key, ecstasy!
I can't let no one disturb this groove, I couldn't stop it if I wanted to,
It's you for me, and me for you in a secret rendez-vous!
