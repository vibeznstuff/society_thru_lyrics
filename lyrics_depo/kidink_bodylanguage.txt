Hate when you say that I play too much

It ain't hard to tell
If you don't wanna take it too far then well
You better stop flirtin' and stop twerkin'
So perfect, cause it's workin'
That ass worth all the worship
You been in yo' bag like Birkin
Never had it like this before me
You ain't know girl better read up on me
You trying to get high, gotta re-up on me
Bein' stuck up gon' leave you lonely for the night
We should leave before the lights on girl
I'm too on
