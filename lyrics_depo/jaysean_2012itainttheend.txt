Bottles poppin 'til we can't stand

Party like it's the end of the world
We gonna party like, like it's 2012

Simile's, metaphors and we pop pills
sick flow inundated with the doc bills
work hard, now we know how to top bills
in the middle of the street doing cartwheels
lot of them tryna do it but it's not real
wasn't a rapper then I could've got a pop deal
white clothes in a hot pink hot wheels
lot of bottles and a lot of booty cocktails
uh, days of our lives
you wink it goes by
so we'll just get it with no Edison
anything goes so no time for closed minds
and free my little weezy
and let's just get right
Young Money, Cash Money in the building
let's go the World ends tonight


Have a drink with me
And let's make tonight go down
In history.. in history yeah
let's play make believe
It's the last 24 hours and this whole world is ours eternally, eternally
