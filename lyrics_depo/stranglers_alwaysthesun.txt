How many times have you woken up and prayed for the rain?
How many times have you seen the papers apportion the blame?
Who gets to say?
Who gets to work and who gets to play?
I was always told at school, everybody should get the same.

How many times have you been told if you don't ask you don't get?
How many lads have taken your money? Your Mother said you shouldn't bet.
Who has the fun?
Is it always a man with a gun?
Someone must have told you if you work too hard you can sweat?

There's always the sun.
Mmmm
There's always the sun.
Always, always, always the sun.

How many times have the weathermen told you stories that made you laugh?
You know its not unlike the politicians and the leaders, when they do things by halves.
Who gets the job?
Of pushing the knob.
That's what responsibility you draw straws for if you're mad enough.

There's always the sun.
Mmmm
There's always the sun.
Always, always, always the sun.

There's always the sun.
Mmmm
There's always the sun.
Always, always, always the sun.
