Oh I cant wait to get next to you
Oh I just can't leave you alone
Boy you got me doing things that I would never do
And I cant stop the way I'm feelin' if I wanted to 
I'm crazy bout the way that you could make me say your name
And if I couldnt have you I would probably go insane cause...


Only u can make me feel (only you can me make me feel)
And only u can take me there (only u can take me there)
And only u can make me feel (only you only you can make me feel)
And only u can take me there (only you can take me there)

Oh I can't wait to get next to you
Oh I just can't leave you alone
Boy you stay inside my mind ain't no denyin' that
And only you could do them things that got me comin' back 
Gotta be the realest thing that I have ever felt
And I'll do wat I gotta do to keep you to myself cause..


Only u can make me feel (only you can me make me feel)
And only u can take me there (only u can take me there)
And only u can make me feel (only you can make me feel)
And only u can take me there (only you can take me there)

Here and I 
Wanna let u

Go


Only u can make me feel (only u can me make me feel)
And only u can take me there (only u can take me there)
And only u can make me feel (u can make me feel)
And only u can take me there (only you can take me there)

Oh I can't wait to get next to you
