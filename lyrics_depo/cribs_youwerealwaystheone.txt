I get the feeling they got you believing
It's better to be loved than left out
But it's like you told me
It's nothing to do with acceptance
It's all about escaping

Then you heard that there's always someone
Forget the wrong one
Disregard your past
But she came with feelings too complex to be amusing
You're gonna get in trouble with that

You're gonna get in trouble with that
You're gonna struggle with that

And I know I said I needed some time alone
And I know I never seem to pick up the phone
And though you will see me with someone else
You were always the one

And I know I said I needed some time alone
And I know I never seem to pick up the phone
And though you will see me with someone else
Yeah, you were always the one

I get the feeling they got you believing
It's better to be loved than left out
But yeah, like you told me
It's nothing to do with acceptance
It's all about escaping

I sentenced myself now a long long time ago
And I hope to be free
But I guess that you've heard that before
So will you try and look surprised
When you find out I lied?

And I know I said I needed some time alone
And I know I never seem to pick up the phone
And though you will see me with someone else
You were always the one

And I know I said I needed some time alone
And I know I never seem to pick up the phone
And though you will see me with someone else
You were always the one
