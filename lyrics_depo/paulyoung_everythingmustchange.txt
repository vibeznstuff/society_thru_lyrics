I was never one to back out of an argument
And say I was wrong.
Even when I'd seen the other side
I'd hide my foolishness and carry on.
But still I'd be embarrassed
'Cause they'd seen what happened and they play along.
Until I back myself into a corner
I will only realize when they had gone.

And like a dream, a life, a reason
Everything must change.
(Every, everything, everything must change)
And like a world, this earth and seasons
Everything must change.
(Every, everything, everything must change)

In the same way when we disagree
I wouldn't be the one to back down.
Still I'd know that you had faith in me
Tell me something. am I letting you down?
'Cause when I woke up and I saw the note
You pressed into the mirror frame
But it was easy to be angry at you
But deep inside I know we share the blame.

Like a dream, a life, a reason
Everything must change.
(Every, everything, everything must change)
And like a world, this earth and seasons
Everything must change.
(Every, everything, everything must change)

I'm going back to the top to start myself off
But first of all something's I need to know, ooh
When I'm scared of being wrong again
Won't you be the one I turn to, to let me know
Oh let me know, oh.
Please, let me be right for once
'Cause right now all I feel I do is wrong.
And it's never too late to learn about love
And this victim needs your hand to hold on.

And like a dream, a life, a reason
Everything must change.
(Every, everything, everything must change)
And like a world, this earth and seasons
Everything must change.
(Every, everything, everything must change)
(Ohh, they change)
(Hoo)
(Hoo)
(Ohh)

And like a dream, a life, a reason
Everything must change.
(Oh, you know that)
And like a world, this earth and seasons
Everything must change.
(Everything must change, everything must change)
And like a dream, a life, a reason
Everything must change.
(And like a dream, a life, a reason
Everything must change.)
(Hoo)
And like a world, this earth and seasons
Everything must change.
(Like a world and seasons, yeah)
(Oh you know)
And like a dream, a life, a reason
Everything must change.
(Just can't stop that, just can't stop that)
(Oh, yeah)
(Like a dream, a life, a reason
Everything must change.)
