I've been stuffed in your pocket for the last hundred days
When I don't get my bath I take it out on the slaves
So grease up your baby for the ball on the hill
Polish them rockets now, and swallow those pills

and sing... Space Lord Mother

Huh! Uh huh

There's a car in the field now in a column of flame
With two doors to choose but only one bears your name
You've been drinking my blood well I've been licking your wounds
I'll shave off the pitch now in the scope of your tune

You'll sing... Space Lord Mother

I left my throne a million miles away
I drink from your tit
I sing your blues every day
Now give me the strength
To split the world in two yeah
I ate all the rest and now I've gotta eat you

Well I sing

Built in my nightmares and using my name
You're stroking my cortex and you know I'm insane
I'm squeezed out in hump drive and drownin' in love
Encompass them all to a position above

Well I sing... Space Lord Mother

I left my throne a million miles away
I drink from your tit
I sing your blues every day
Now give me the strength
To split the world in two yeah
I ate all the rest and now I've gotta eat you

Well I sing... Space Lord Mother

I lost my soul when I fell to earth
My planets called me to the void of my birth
The time has come for me to kill this game
Now open wide and say my name

Space Lord Mother
