You're the one for me
You're my ecstasy
You're the one I need

Hey, yeah


Get down
Get down
And move it all around


Hey baby love I need a girl like you
But tell me if you feel it too
I'm in delusion every minute every hour
My heart is crying out for you


I feel in heaven when I look in your eyes
I know that you are the one for me (one for me)
You drive me crazy cuz
You're one of a kind
I want your lovin'
And I want it right now




Ooh baby you're so fine
I'm gonna make you mine
Your lips they taste so sweet
You're the one for me
You're my ecstasy
You're the one I need

Rap: Smooth T.
Bang, bang, bang

All the girls
Get on your knees
Tryin' to scream
Or touch me please
Backstreet Boys
Are you with it (yeah)

Smack it up

And move it all around
