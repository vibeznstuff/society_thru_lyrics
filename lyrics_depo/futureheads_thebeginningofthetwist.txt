It's time to wake up, it's time to change
Let's get it started, I feel like there's so much to rearrange
Come on, I need your help with this
Why don't we get it started with a kiss?

If memory serves
Then why am I still waiting for it to return?
My head feels like it's just about to slip
This morning is just a blur, today lingers on like a bad year

I can feel it, I conceal it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I conceal it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist

I can feel it, I conceal it
Beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I conceal it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist

We get along well, we talk a lot
I made some promises, I guess that I totally forgot
Forgive me, my mind is elsewhere
Feels like somebody's thrown it down the stairs

It's not good enough
(I've heard these same excuses before)
I thought you knew enough about it
But you still want more, today I don't feel so ill
If only I could find the time, I want to kill

I can feel it, I conceal it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I conceal it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist

I can feel it, I conceal it
Beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I conceal it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist

I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist

I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist

I can feel it, I conceal it
Beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I conceal it
Beginning of the twist

I can feel it, I conceal it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I conceal it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist
