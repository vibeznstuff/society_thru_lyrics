There's a dream, I feel
So rare, so real
All the world in union
The world as one

Gathering together
One mind, one heart
Every creed, every colour
Once joined, never apart

It's the world in union
The world as one
As we climb to reach our destiny
A new age has begun

Searching for the best in me
I will find what I can be
If I win, lose or draw
is a victory for all

We may face high mountains
Must cross rough seas
We must take our place in history
And live with dignity

Just to be the best I can
Sets the goal for every man
If I win, lose or draw
It's a victory for all

It's the world in union
The world as one
As we climb to reach our destiny
A new age has begun

It's the world in union
The world as one
As we climb to reach our destiny
A new age has begun
