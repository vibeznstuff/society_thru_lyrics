Come on, just do it, uh
Do it, uh
Do it till you're good and tired

I was sitting all alone, yeah
A lot on my mind
I felt a tap on my shoulder
And I rolled my eyes
I wasn't in the mood for another man
Telling me lies
But how can a girl say no
When you flash that sexy smile?

And you say
"Uh huh, ay hey
Want to see you get nasty
Want to see you shake it down, babe"

N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you're just my type

N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you're just my type

In the middle of the floor now
And I just don't care
Take my body so low now
The crowd stops and stares
Let them say what they want but I'm feeling it
And it's for you, baby
Tell me how can a girl say no
When you're calling out to me?

And you say
"Uh huh, ay hey
Want to see you get nasty
Want to see you shake it down, babe"

N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you're just my type

N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you're just my type

What's your fantasy?
Tell them all to me
Don't you be afraid
Share your nasty secrets, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

"Uh huh, ay hey
Want to see you get nasty
Want to see you shake it down, babe"

N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
Boy, you're just so nasty

N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you're just my type

N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
Boy, you're just so
