Oh look what I've done for you
I made it all for you, I've come to set it right
Oh look what I've made for you
I've come to set it right

Can't stay this way, can't stay this way
I shouldn't feel this way

I won't let go, never gonna let go
It's a pity you should say it 'cause it never really means a thing
Won't let go, I'm never gonna let go
(Won't let go, won't let go)
I won't let go, never gonna let go
It's a pity you should say it 'cause it never really means a thing
Won't let go, I'm never gonna let go
(Won't let go, won't let go)

Oh look what you've done to me
You took it all away, took it all in just one night
Oh I was saving it all for you
But you took it all away

Can't play this game, 'cause it's not the same
I shouldn't feel this shame, (I'm never gonna feel it again)

I won't let go, never gonna let go
It's a pity you should say it 'cause it never really means a thing
Won't let go, I'm never gonna let go
(Won't let go, won't let go)
I won't let go, never gonna let go
It's a pity you should say it 'cause it never really means a thing
Won't let go, I'm never gonna let go
(Won't let go), I won't let go

I can't stay this way, can't stay this way
I shouldn't feel this way, I shouldn't feel this way
I can't stay this way, oh no no no
I shouldn't feel this way

I won't let go, never gonna let go
It's a pity you should say it 'cause it never really means a thing
Won't let go, I'm never gonna let go
(Won't let go, won't let go)
I won't let go, never gonna let go
It's a pity you should say it 'cause it never really means a thing
Won't let go, I'm never gonna let go
(Won't let go, won't let go)

I won't let go, I'm never gonna let go
It's a pity you should say it 'cause it never really means a thing
Won't let go, I'm never gonna let go

I won't let go, I'm never gonna let go
It's a pity you should say it 'cause it never really means a thing
Won't let go, won't let go
