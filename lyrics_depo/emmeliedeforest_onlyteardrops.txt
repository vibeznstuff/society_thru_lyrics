The sky is red tonight
We're on the edge tonight
No shooting star to guide us

Eye for an eye
Why tear each other apart?
Please tell me why
Why do we make it so hard?
Look at us now
We only got ourselves to blame
It's such a shame

How many times can we win and lose?
How many times can we break the rules?
Between us
Only teardrops

How many times do we have to fight?
How many times till we get it right?
Between us
Only teardrops

So come and face me now
Here on the stage tonight
Let's leave the past behind us

Eye for an eye
Why tear each other apart?
Please tell me why
Why do we make it so hard?
Look at us now
We only got ourselves to blame
It's such a shame

Tell me
How many times can we win and lose?
How many times can we break the rules?
Between us
Only teardrops

How many times do we have to fight?
How many times till we get it right?
Between us
Only teardrops

(Tell me now) 
What's gone between us? 
Has come between us?
Only teardrops
(Tell me now) 
What's gone between us? 
Has come between us?

How many times can we win and lose?
How many times can we break the rules?
Between us
Only teardrops

How many times do we have to fight?
How many times till we get it right?
Between us
Only teardrops
Only teardrops
Oh... only teardrops
Only teardrops

How many times can we win and lose?
How many times can we break the rules?
Between us
Only teardrops

How many times do we have to fight?
How many times till we get it right?
Between us
Only teardrops
