I hope we make it through 
I hope the sea is just as blue as our dream 
We’ve got a long way to climb 
Until we see what we left behind. 

We wake to the sound of drums 
And we are the soldiers of our own events 
We are the keys to the kingdom 
And we will never wear clothes again 

You get up 
Move around 
Every time you hear a sound 
What do you expect to see 
Every time you look at me? 

I know this is gonna be alright. 

Mercury summer 
In the afternoon 
I hope you come back soon 
Mercury summer  
You just take your time 
I hope to see you. 

So how can you fall asleep 
So close to the fire that is keeping us warm? 
Sleeping out in the rough 
Just let me know when you’ve had enough. 

You get up 
Move around 
Every time you hear a sound 
What do you expect to see 
Every time you look at me? 

I know this is gonna be alright. 

Mercury summer  
In the afternoon 
I hope you come back soon 
Mercury summer  
You just take your time 
I hope to see you.

Mercury summer  
In the afternoon 
I hope you come back soon 
Mercury summer  
You just take your time 
I hope to see you. 

Ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh oohh  

Mercury summer  
In the afternoon 
I hope you come back soon 
Mercury summer  
You just take your time 
I hope to see you. 

Mercury summer  
In the afternoon 
I hope you come back soon 
Mercury summer  
You just take your time 
I hope to see you.
