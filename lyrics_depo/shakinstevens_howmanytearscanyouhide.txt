How many tears can you hide
For you can't hide anymore
How can you keep it inside
When she says you need to be sure

How many tears can you hide
Before your heart is in danger
How many times do I die
Each time you're with a stranger

Your love (How many tears can you hide)
Is the sweetest thing (How many tears can you hide)
Your love (How many tears can you hide)
Means everything
But your love,... driving me insane
How long (How long)
Can I (Can I), Go on?

How many times do I hide
Put on a happy face
Watching you walking by
Some other guy in my place
You never know how I try
to end this misery
How many tears can I hide
To you belong to me

Your love (How many tears can you hide)
Is the sweetest thing (How many tears can you hide)
Your love (How many tears can you hide)
Means everything
But your love, (your love)... driving me insane
How long (How long)
Can I (Can I), Go on?

Your love (How many tears can you hide)
Is the sweetest thing (How many tears can you hide)
Your love (How many tears can you hide)
Means everything (How many tears can you hide)
But your love,...(your love) it is driving me insane
How long (How long)
Can I (Can I), Go on?

Girl your love (How many tears can you hide)
Is the sweetest thing (How many tears can you hide)
Your love (How many tears can you hide)
Means everything (How many tears can you hide)
Girl your love (How many tears can you hide)
(How many tears can you hide)
Girl your love (How many tears can you hide)
(How many tears can you hide)
