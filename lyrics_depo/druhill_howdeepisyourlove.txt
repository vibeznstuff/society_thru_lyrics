Hey mami don't you know that I like it when you call me papi 
But it seems like lately baby that you've been seeing another chico 
And baby you know that he can't go down like me 
And you know the nigga can't freak like me 
So mami tell me one little thing 
How deep is your love for me 

 
How deep is your love for me 
Tell me what it's gonna be 
Do you see yourself 
Fucking with a nigga like me 
On the low though so your friends won't know, see now 
How deep is your love for me 
Tell me what it's gonna be 
Do you see yourself 
Fucking with a nigga like me 
On the low though so your friends won't know, see now

The way you move your body

But I bet you he keep telling you he better than me 
Ooh you know that he can't go down like me 
And you know that he ain't no freak like me 
So baby tell me one little thing 
How deep is you love for me

Yo, yo, yo, yo, buenos dias mama, creep with doctor bullshit, when I 
talk my teeth should rot, I'm from the Ritz which means I'm born to dog, 
you heard this, wanna a shot at it, warn them all, I hit all off from the 
bathroom stall, tappin' draws and they get gas to pass, platinum cars, 
Then I'm like yo, yo going to buy my crew bikes, with double pipes and we 
quick to lose on the turnpike, I'm the one that turned you out, dug 
it out, it was the Hennessy that made us thug it out, what you like 
shit freaky, you down with it, your other man's a punk with a hand to 
punk tha grunge, ride out tough, even Honey Comb hide out, duck the hour 
rush, better choose quick chick, I got tracks to dust, Dru Hill, Def 
Squad, if you askin' us
