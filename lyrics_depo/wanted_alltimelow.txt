Praying won't do it
Hating won't do it
Drinking won't do it
Fighting won't knock you out
Of my head

Hiding won't hide it
Smiling won't hide it
Like I ain't tried it
Everyone's tried it now
And failed somehow

So when you gonna let me
When you gonna let me out, out

And if you know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces
It seems like peace is
The only thing I'll never know
How do you get up?
Get up?

'Cause driving won't do it
Flying won't do it
Denying won't do it
Crying won't drown it out
What you said

When I'm standing on the yellow line
Waiting at the station
Or I'm late for work
A vital presentation
If you call me now girl
Without reservation
I would try to break through

But if you know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces
It seems like peace is
The only thing I never know
How do you get up from an all time low?

I can't even find a place to start
How do I choose between my head and heart?
Till it ceases I'll never know
How do you get up from an all time low?

A low 
Can you hear me?
A low 
Can't you hear me?
A low 
Can you hear me?
A low 

And if you know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces
It seems like peace is
The only thing I'll never know
How do you get up from an all time low?

I can't even find a place to start
How do I choose between my head and heart
Till it ceases I'll never know
How do you get up from an all time low?

I can't even find a place to start
How do I choose between my head and heart?
Till it ceases I'll never know
How do you get up from an all time low?
