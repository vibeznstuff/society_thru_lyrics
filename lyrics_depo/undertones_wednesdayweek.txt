Here she comes to say good night
I'll get no sleep tonight
With a constant vision she still can see
She was the girl for me

Wednesday week - she loved me
Wednesday week - never happened at all

There she goes I want to see her again
She's gone to school with her best friend
She only does the things she likes to do
Now she wants something new

Wednesday week - she loved me
Wednesday week - never happened at all

Here she comes to say good night
I'll get no sleep tonight
With a constant vision she still can see
She was the girl for me

Wednesday week - she loved me
Wednesday week - never happened at all
