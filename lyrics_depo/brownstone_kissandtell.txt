Hey
Oh oh


Baby
You know you're really driving me crazy
You know I wanna be your lady
Why you wanna act so shady?
Darling, can you hear me calling?
Catch me coz I'm falling
In love with you

Tell me if you kiss and tell 
If you will that just won't do
I got something for your body 
Stays between me and you

I never had a real lover
Cause all the guys I dated were too immature
I need your help to discover
All the love inside for you
I gave you my love and my life; my time, my everything  
Tell me what you wanna do; what's on your mind


Baby
You know you're really driving me crazy
You know I wanna be your lady
Why you wanna act so shady?
Darling, don't you know you hear me calling?
Catch me coz I'm falling
In love with you
So tell me...

Tell me if you kiss and tell 
If you will that just won't do
I got something for your body 
Stays between me and you

...
To give you what a woman should
But as long as it stays between us baby
Never let our secret lose
I give my love, my heart my time my everything
Tell me what you wanna do
Now baby its up to you

Baby
You know you're really driving me crazy
You know I wanna be your lady
Why you wanna act so shady?
Darling, can you hear me calling?
Catch me coz I'm falling
In love with you

Tell me if you kiss and tell 
If you will that just won't do
I got something for your body 
Stays between me and you
