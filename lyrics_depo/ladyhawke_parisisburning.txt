All of the boys and the girls here, in Paris.
Sing to the night without sight, but with madness.
I can't keep up, I'm a wreck, but I want it.
Tell me the truth, is it love or just Paris?

All of the boys and the girls here, in Paris.
Sing to the night without sight, but with madness.
I can't keep up, I'm a wreck, but I want it.
Tell me the truth, is it love or just Paris?

My heart is yearning, but Paris is burning.
Paris is burning all night long.
My heart is dreaming, but Paris is screaming.
Paris is screaming all night long.

My heart is yearning, but Paris is burning.
Paris is burning all night long.
My heart is dreaming, but Paris is screaming.
Paris is screaming all night long.

Kids in the street drinking wine, on the sidewalk.
Saving the plans that we made, 'till its night time.
Give me your glass, its your last, you're too wasted.
Or get me one too, 'cause I'm due any tasting.

I've lost my way, its hard to find it through.
I see the night, but I'm lost outside of you.
