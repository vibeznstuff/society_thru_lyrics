Oh Stacey look what you've done, 
You think that you're the only one . . . 

Well, she should've went to school 
And she should've made it through 
But she never 

And she should've studied hard 
And she should've played the part 
But she never 

Oh and she should have kept her head 
And got out of bed 
More in the mornings 

And she should've had her day 
Should have done it her way 
But she never 
Oh Yeah 

She made her Father worry 'til he was sick 
Found him on the couch one night cold and stiff 
Now she drinks away the will and she's not proud of it 

Oh Stacey look what you've done, 
You think that you're the only one . . . 

Oh she should've had more time 
To get to know the world 
A little better 

And she should've had more friends, 
To glue her brain and stick it back together 

But she had to go around 
And disagree with everyone she knew 

And now all her friends 
They're gonna help her spend the fortune 
Oh yeah 

She made her Father worry 'til he was sick 
Found him on the couch one night cold and stiff 
Now she drinks away the will and she's not proud of it 

Oh?. 

Wasn't always gonna be this way, 
It didn't have to daunt her 
But I knew that's what she'd say 

I will put the flowers on 
And visit every week 
But that won't wake your father from his every lasting sleep 

She made her Father worry 'til he was sick 
Found him on the couch one night cold and stiff 
Now she drinks away the will and she's not proud of it 

Oh Stacey look what you've done, 
You think that you're the only one . . . 
Stacey 
Oh Stacey 
Oh Stacey 
Oh Stacey 
Oh Stacey 
Oh Stacey 
Oh Stacey, look what you've done 
Stacey, 
Oh Stacey 
Oh Stacey 
Oh Stacey 
Oh Stacey 
Oh Stacey, you think that you're the only one 

Oh Stacey, look what you've done ..
