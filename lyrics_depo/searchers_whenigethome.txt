There's gonna be good times baby, just wait and see
Music and parties and laughter like it used to be
'Cause I'm comin' back to make us a life of our own
When I get home, when I get home baby

Five thousand miles from you baby is far I know
But just remember this baby wherever you go
I'm gonna love you, never leave you alone
When I get home, when I get home baby

When I get home
You're gonna wake up and find there's a new kind of dawn
Baby, when I get home
I'm gonna make up for all the time I've been gone
Baby, baby, if you love me

You'll hang on a little bit longer and we'll see it through
Their ain't no nothin' can stop me from reaching you
And I'm gonna give you a love like you've never known
When I get home, when I get home baby
When I get home baby
When I get home baby
When I get home
