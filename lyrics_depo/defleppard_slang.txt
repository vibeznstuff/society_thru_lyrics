Sittin' Dark 
Getting taken 
'Cause I said 
Something lewd in a 
Low down accent 

Yeah Yeah Yeah 
Kinda love those eyes 
I wanna get down honey 
But I ain't your guy 

I'll rap'n ruch 
'N jam it up 
But count me out 
Cause all I ever wanna get is slang 

Slang with me - I don't wanna get my hands dirty 
Slang with me - I just wanna get soakin' wet 
Slang with me - I don't wanna get my hands dirty 
All I ever wanna get is slang 

What's affectin' my condition 
What's about to knock you down 
Said wrapped 'n bound and a goddamn 
I'd love to get connected 
But it's outta my hands 





It's my intention to be your obsession 
It's my obsession to be your addiction
