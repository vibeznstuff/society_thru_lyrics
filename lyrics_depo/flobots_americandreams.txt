The whole world is watching
The whole world is watching
Something in my family tree is rotten

Ancestors so grotesque
Plans of destiny to go west
Manifest bleeds protest
10 million rest in peace below depths
Oh no
Oh yes
No struggle no progress
Bend the rules run the jewels
40 acres and a mule and no less
Who claims to know best though
Who's trained to protect those
Some of those who burn crosses also arraign and arrest those
Some of those current losses this fiscal year are exceptional
They've got more guns than destro
Make you disappear like presto
I wrote this rap to pray
For another life castaway
Now that's more settlement cash to pay
But that won't bring daddy back today
That's just more petals at the grave
The moonlight saw that display
So what more can I do my God
When there's nothing left to say
Meet me at the gate and sing kumbaya

Scheming for a way to stay up
Dreaming of the day I wake up

Momma was a bloody knuckled valedictorian
Poppa was a comet from the quarry and tobacco fields
Cover me in notes of old hickory and moses
The cotton linen blends the benefits of forbidden yields
Black feet move without reservations
Our bodies wall the streets
We resume our occupations
Claims of common sense
More cautious than caucasian condiments
Black cowboys are real
But they ain't myths
Black avengers show up before the crowd'll get pissed
And the milk goes as sour as a counterfeit kiss
We can still make a pound of biscuits
Get some fish
And feed a crowd of misfits
Where the lyricists spit
The merits of the heretic
Is where the patriot lives
And we hate to relive
What it takes to forgive
Can't forget what we did
Better yet let's amend
To protect next of kin
By accepting our sins
