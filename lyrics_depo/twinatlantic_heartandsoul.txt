I flick the switch on the generator
So I could turn you on
You better get to know your operator
Before you pick that tone

You own the lock and the key
For the window to my soul
Yeah, that's the only thing you talk about
You gotta let me know

Cause it must have been something
Out of control
Yeah, it must have been worth it
Cause I had nothing left to show
How you put my life in your hands

When you open up your heart and your soul
Take my love and never grow old, yeah
Open up your heart and your soul
Cause if you're looking for something to love
You've gotta let me know

I put the sun in an elevator
And took it to my home
I'm still living on a ladder
From the sky to the floor

Don't look down
You got a long way to go
And if you wanna live
You better let the mind go

Cause it must have been something
Out of control
Yeah, it must have been worth it
Cause I had nothing left to show
How you put my life in your hands

When you open up your heart and your soul
Take my love and never grow old, yeah
Open up your heart and your soul
Cause if you're looking for something to love
You've gotta let me know

I flick the switch on the generator
So I could turn you on
Yeah, that's the only thing you talk about
You gotta let me know
You gotta let me know

Open up your heart and your soul
Take my love and never grow old, yeah
Open up your heart and your soul
Cause if you're looking for something to love
You've gotta let me know

Open up your heart and your soul (Open up your heart and your soul)
Take my love and never grow old, yeah (Take my love and never grow old)
Open up your heart and your soul (Open up your heart and your soul)
Cause if you're just looking for love
You've gotta let me know
