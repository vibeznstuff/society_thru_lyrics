It's Christmas Eve, and snow is on the ground
Mistletoe and holly all around
Yes, all the world is happy, but since you went away
My Christmas will be just another lonely day
Yeah, another lonely day, yeah

My tree is trimmed with pretty colored lights
And at the top, the Christmas star shines bright
Yes, everything around me is very bright and gay
But Christmas will be just another lonely day
Yeah, another lonely day, yeah

I had a lonely September, October, November, too
But December is twice as lonely without you

For soon it will be time for Santa Claus
And surely he will bring you back, because
Without you here beside me, my world will be so gray
And Christmas will be just another lonely day
Yeah, another lonely day, yeah
Another lonely day, yeah
Another lonely day, yeah
