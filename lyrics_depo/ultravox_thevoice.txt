Native these words seem to me
All speech directed to me
I've heard them once before
I know that feeling

Stranger emotions in mind
Changing the contours I find
I've seen them once before
Someone cries to me

Oh, the look and the sound of the voice
They try, they try
Oh, the shape and the power of the voice
In strong low tones

Forceful and twisting again
Wasting the perfect remains
I've felt it once before
Slipping over me

Oh, the look and the sound of the voice
They try, they try
Oh, the shape and the power of the voice
In strong low tones

Sweetly the voices decay
Draw on the lines that they say
I'd lost it once before
Now it cries to me

Oh, the look and the sound of the voice
They try, they try
Oh, the shape and the power of the voice
In strong low tones

Oh, the look and the power of the voice
They try
Oh, the shape and the sound of the voice
In strong low tones
