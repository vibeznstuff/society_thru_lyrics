I never thought you'd feel
this way
The way you feel about me
I just wanna to hold you tight
Real tight, close to me
And the things you used to say
And the things you used to do
I let it go 'cause I love you so
And though things never go
my way
Why do you always have
to play
With my feelings
Cause
Don't take my mind on a trip
Cause to play me for a fool
You don't love me
that ain't cool
no no
Don't take my mind on a trip
Don't take my love for granted
'Cause that's not the way we
planned it
Always going out at night
Playing games on me
Telling me all those lies
'Cause you've been seen with
another guy
Everybody makes mistakes
Don't you know that it's ok
I still love you so
I just can't let you go
And it's not that I'm a fool
I'm just so in love with you
I can't stand the
blues.. cause...
It's not the way we planned it
Don't take my mind on a trip
Cause to play me for a fool
You don't love me that ain't cool
