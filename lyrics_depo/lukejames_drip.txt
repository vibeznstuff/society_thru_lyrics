Never be afraid of the shit that you're going through
Don't underestimate your ability to push through

Deal with you emotion (oooh)
Dive into the ocean (oooh)
Everything is open (oooh)
You're the one that's chosen (mmm oohh)

Let it, drip
Let it, drip
Let it, drip (mama)
Let it, drip

Feeling on your booty but I'd rather feel your soul (soul) soul
Girl I know you ain't Janet but I like you in control (control)
(I like you in control, I like you control)

Baby deal with your emotion (oooh) deal with them
Dive into the ocean (oooh) dive in, dive in
Everything is open (oooh) everything is open baby
You're the one that's chosen (mmm oohh)

Let it, drip
Let it, drip
Let it, drip (mama)
Let it, drip

Let it, drip
Let it, drip
Let it, drip (mama)
Let it, drip

{Take your time}

You too fucking fine to be dealing with some bullshit
Girl that pussy's mine I just gotta pick a bone with it

You too fucking fine to be dealing with some bullshit
Girl that pussy's mine I just gotta pick a bone with it
