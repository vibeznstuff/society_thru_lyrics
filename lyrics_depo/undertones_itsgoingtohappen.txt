Happens all the time
It's going to happen - happen - till your change your mind
It's going to happen - happen - happens all the time
It's going to happen - happen - till your change your mind

Best story I ever heard
The truth about fat Mr X and the young girl
See how far he'll let you go
Before he persuades you when you're walking home

Happens all the time
It's going to happen - happen - till your change your mind
It's going to happen - happen - happens all the time
It's going to happen - happen - till your change your mind

Watching your friends passing by
Going to sleep without blinking a blue eye
Too slow to notice what's wrong
Two faced to you when you're taking them on

Happens all the time
It's going to happen - happen - till your change your mind
It's going to happen - happen - happens all the time
It's going to happen - happen - till your change your mind

Everything goes when you're dead
Everything empties from what was in your head
No point in waiting today
Stupid revenge is what's making you stay

It's going to happen - happen - till your change your mind
