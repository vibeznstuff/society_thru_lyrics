I know you got the hummer for the summer baby
But I got your number baby
I got your number baby

I was trying to protect you from yourself
'Cause I respect you
And I feel like you just might
Be some one who I could get into
But I never seem to catch your eye
And it's been buggin' me why I even try
Still you're someone I'd like to get to know
Is there room for me in your one-man show


A car this fine don't pass your way everyday
Don't cha wanna ride baby
Don't cha wanna ride baby
A car this fine don't pass your way everyday
Don't cha wanna ride baby
Don't cha wanna ride baby
Time is slipping by, by, by
Slipping by

I was trying to connect with you
But you acted scared when I'm checkin you
And all my girls say you're hard to please
But I think that I got just what you need
Get your face out of the mirror
Then maybe you could consider
This girl who's knockin' right at your door
Make room for me in your one-man show



I know you got the hummer for the summer baby
But I got your number baby
I got your number baby

I know where you live 
I know all 'bout your crib
But do you know that they can't give you what I give
