Hey, hey, hey,

Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you
Blow my mind

Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind

Hey, soul sister,
Ain't that Mr. Mister
On the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister,
I don't wanna miss
A single thing you do tonight

Hey, hey, hey,

Just in time,
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection,
We can't deny

I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna
Blow your mind

Hey, soul sister,
Ain't that Mr. Mister
On the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey, soul sister,
I don't wanna miss
A single thing you do tonight

Way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug
I need
So gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of

You see
I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you'll be
With me

Hey, soul sister,
Ain't that Mr. Mister
On the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey, soul sister,
I don't wanna miss
A single thing you do tonight

Hey, soul sister,
I don't wanna miss
A single thing you do tonight
Hey, hey, hey, tonight
Hey, hey, hey, tonight
