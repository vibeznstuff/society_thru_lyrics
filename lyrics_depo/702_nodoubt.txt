We gotta get down,
To what it's all about.
See I want you,
And that's no doubt.


I can tell you noticed me,
Only because I noticed you.
Walked through the crowd to get your name,
And to give you mine too,
'Cos we gotta get down...




We don't have to talk about,
All the things we've been through,
Just as long as you respect me.
Get to the point don't mess around,
Let's talk about how feel now.


I just wanna know,
If we could take this thing that we feel,
To a level where love is real.
Take it slow so we can last,
Look to the future forget the past.
