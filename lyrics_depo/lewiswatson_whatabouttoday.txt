Call me up,
'cause you know that I'll be there.
Hell, this is so messed up
But that doesn't mean I don't care, no

"stay the night"
You whisper to me.
(well you know that I can't) but you'll just cry
If I were to disagree

Take this away, take this away
You loved me last night but what about today

You keep saying that we were meant to be
Well it must be the alcohol
But it feels great when you're hugging me
Into my body you fold

Your tongue tastes of nicotine
But you're saying that you just had one
Wait, why are you kissing me
I thought you need some time alone.

Take this away, take this away
You loved me last night but what about today
