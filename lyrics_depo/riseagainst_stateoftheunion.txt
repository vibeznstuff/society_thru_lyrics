If we're the flagship of peace and prosperity
We're taking on water and about to fuckin' sink
No one seems to notice, no one even blinks
The crew all left the passengers to die under the sea


Countdown, to the very end, 
Equality, an invitation that we wont extend
Ready aim, pull the trigger now, 
In time you firmly secure your place in hell 

State of the union address, 
Reads war torn country still a mess
The words: power, death, and distorted truth
Are read between the lines of the red, white, and blue



Your place in hell 

'Guilty' is what our graves will read, 
No years, no family, we did 
Nothing (nothing) to stop the murder of 
A people just like us
