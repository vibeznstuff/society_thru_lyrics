Just holding your hand, while the sea breeze blows 
And the waves roll in, swaying those boats 
Girl it makes me think 
I'd like to rock you sweet 

Up ahead on the dock there's a little jam band 
It's not a far walk if you want to dance 
In your bare feet 
And I could rock you sweet 


and if we get on a roll 
Start feeling something deep 
Baby just let go 
And I'll rock you, rock you sweet 

How'd it get so late, I don't wanna go home 
There's a hammock over there big enough for both 
You can drift off to sleep 
While I rock you sweet 



And if we get on a roll 
Start feeling something deep 
Baby just go 
And I'll rock you, rock you, rock you, rock you 



Rock you sweet 
Rock you sweet 
Rock you sweet 
Rock you sweet
