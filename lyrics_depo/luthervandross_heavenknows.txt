Heaven knows I love you
Heaven knows how much I care
Couldn't live without you
Look for me and I'll be there

But, even though you're a joy to me
I think you think, "he's a bore to me"
What your thing, am I still your guy?
I'm so confused, my darling, I could die

You're the one on my mind
Got me working overtime
I only think about love and you
Talk to me, don't be shy
Heaven knows I really try to love you...
I try to love you

Used to be amazing
Used to make the world say "wow"
Heaven brought us together
That's how I know it'll all work out

We bulit our love on a solid ground
And can't a thing ever bring us down
Back together like we wanted to
Forget me not, 'cause I remember you

You're still the one on my mind
Love is working overtime
I only dream about love and you
Talk to me, don't be shy
Heaven know I really try to love you...
I try to love you, yeah

You're the one on my mind
Got me working overtime
I only think about love, don't you?
Talk to me, don't be shy
Heaven knows I really try to love you...
I try to love you, baby

This is love that you can't ignore
I never knew a girl like you before
And heaven knows I couldn't love you more...

This is so right
This is so right
This is so right
Because I love you
I really love you, baby

Back together like we wanted to
Forget me not, 'cause I remember you

Work, it can work
Gonna work out, gonna work out
Work, its going work
Gonna work out, gonna work it out
Work, its gonna work, 'cause I love
Heaven knows and I know it can...
