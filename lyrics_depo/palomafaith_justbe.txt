Let's get old together
Let's be unhappy forever
Cause there's no one else in this world
That I'd rather be unhappy with
Let's be exposed and unprotected
Let's see one another when we're weak
Let's go our separate ways in the night
Like two moths
But know that you're flying home to me

I was born thinking
It would all be dreamy
But I know that I wouldn't be happy that way
You wear me out with frustration and heartache and anger
But we wait for the wave just to wash it away

Don't say nothing
Just sit next to me
Don't say nothing
Shhh
Just be, just be, just be

Let's let go together
Let us unfold one another
And watch all the little things that once drew me to you
Eventually get on my nerves

I wear you out with frustration and heartache and anger
But we wait for the wave just to wash it away

Don't say nothing
Just sit next to me
Don't say nothing
Shhh
Just be, just be, just be

When you're sick of the every day oh
When you're tired of my voice
When you tell me
You'll walk out that door
That's when I know that you'll stay

Don't say nothing
Just sit next to me
Don't say nothing
Just be, just be
Just don't say nothing
Just sit next to me
Don't say nothing
Just be, just be, just be

Don't say nothing
Shhhhh
