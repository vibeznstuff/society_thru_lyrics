It's hard to see you walk away
It hurts to see you go
But if I asked you to stay
Would it matter anyway

I'm not surprised you're leaving
I've known it all along
But my life will still go on
Yes, my life will still go on

I'll find a way to make it through
The long and lonely night
Find a way to live without you
Without you in my life

'Cause baby, baby
The sun ain't gonna shine if you're not with me
I'll live without the love you have to give me
I'll make it through the night
I'm gonna be alright

But baby, baby
The stars ain't gonna dance across the heavens
The moon is gonna hide away forever
I know I'll make it through
But it won't be the same without you, baby
Without you, baby

Maybe I'll be better
Better on my own
I can stay out all night long
I'll have a good time when you're gone

Maybe it won't be so bad
To be here all alone
I'll have all the time to do
All the things I wanna do

So go ahead and walk away
If that's what you wanna do
'Cause I've got my life to live
And I can live it without you

'Cause baby, baby
The sun ain't gonna shine if you're not with me
I'll live without the love you have to give me
I'll make it through the night
I'm gonna be alright

But baby, baby
The stars ain't gonna dance across the heavens
The moon is gonna hide away forever
I know I'll make it through
But it won't be the same without you, baby
Without you, baby

I'll find a way to make it
Through the long and lonely night
Find a way to live without you in my life
Without you in my life

'Cause baby, baby
The sun ain't gonna shine if you're not with me
I'll live without the love you have to give me
I'll make it through the night
I'm gonna be alright

But baby, baby
The stars ain't gonna dance across the heavens
The moon is gonna hide away forever
I know I'll make it through
But it won't be the same without you

The sun ain't gonna shine if you're not with me
I'll live without the love you have to give me
I'll make it through the night
I'm gonna be alright...
