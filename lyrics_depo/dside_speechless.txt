Speechless
Oooh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah 

Tragic, completely 
When the one you love keeps runnin games with your heart
I feel the static, inside me
Should I stay, should I go, I don't know where to start 

Coz baby you and I don't you know we got something that's beautiful 
And yes you're the one even though that I know it's illogical
Cos baby 


You've got something over me 
And right now it's all a mystery 
This thing's taken over you see
No matter what I do, I'm speechless over you 
It don't make any sense at all 
But I'm here to always take the fall 
Baby, here's the proof
No matter what you do, I'm speechless over you

Panic, should I let go?
Life ain't as easy as a simple ABC
I've had it, baby you know
You've been steering that wheel to somewhere I can't see

Coz baby you and I don't know we got something incredible 
And yes you're the one even though that I know it's illogical 
Coz baby 



Why can't you give your heart away 
What can I do to make you stay 
Just when I try to walk away 
Something tells me
