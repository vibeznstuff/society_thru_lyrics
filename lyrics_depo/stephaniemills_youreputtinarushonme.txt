You're puttin' a rush on me 
But I'd like to know you better 
You're puttin' a rush on me 
But I'd like to know you better 

What kind of girl do you think I am 
It's just too soon, can't you understand I'm not the kind of girl who has to 
Lay you down before I fall in love 
It's been kind of relaxed here waiting 
But baby, you got to slow down 

You're puttin' a rush on me 
But I'd like to know you better (Maybe next time) 
You're puttin' a rush on me 
But I'd like to know you better (Baby) 

You're puttin' a rush on me 
But I'd like to know you better (Maybe next time) 
You're puttin' a rush on me 
But I'd like to know you better (Baby) 

Please just be patient if nothing else, oh, babe 
Just know that I respect myself, yes, I do 
But I hope I didn't lead you to thinking 
Thinking that I was that easy, boy 
I know that we're living in the 80s 
Yet some things never change 

You're puttin' a rush on me 
But I'd like to know you better (Maybe next time) 
You're puttin' a rush on me 
But I'd like to know you better (Baby) 

You're puttin' a rush on me 
But I'd like to know you better (Maybe next time) 
You're puttin' a rush on me 
But I'd like to know you better (Baby) 

I'm just an old fashioned girl 
When it comes down to love 
Before I give you some love 
I've got to be sure your intentions are pure 

(Oh, babe) You're puttin' a rush on me (Take it easy, baby) 
But I'd like to know you better (Don't rush it, baby) 
You're puttin' a rush on me 
But I'd like to know you better (Maybe next time, oh...) 

You're puttin' a rush on me (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah) 

You're puttin' a rush on me (Puttin' a rush on me) 
Baby, can't you see (Oh, can't you see) 
Puttin' a rush on me (You're puttin' a rush on me) 
Yeh, ey, hey, hey 

You're puttin' a rush on me (Oh, babe) 
But I'd like to know you better (Puttin' a rush on me, don't-don't do it, babe) 
You're puttin' a rush on me (I can't stand it, baby) 
But I'd like to know you better (Don't you do it, baby, ah...oh...oh...) 

You're puttin' a rush on me (Oh...oh...oh...oh...) 
But I'd like to know you better (Yeah) 

You're puttin' a rush on me (You're puttin' a rush on me) 
Oh, baby, can't you see (Oh, baby, can't you see) 
Puttin' a rush on me (Puttin' a rush on me) 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'd like to know 

You're puttin' a rush on me 
But I'd like to know you better (Oh, baby, ooh, ooh, ooh, babe) 
You're puttin' a rush on me (Slow down, boy) 
But I'd like to know you better (Take it easy) 

You're puttin' a rush on me 
But I'd like to know you better
