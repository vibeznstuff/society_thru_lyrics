I say goodnight to an empty space beside me
The only reply is the beat of my heart
I wake up and I make two black cups of coffee
The routine being with you taught me left its mark
These old, old habits die hard

I get in the car and turn the radio on
Expecting you to sing along but you never start
It's a lonely road and I can't see where it ends
Where I'm goin' and where we've been are so far apart
These old, old habits die hard

I said goodbye when you let go
Still I hold on to all I've known
Wherever I am there you are
'Cause old, old habits die hard

These four walls are slowly closing in around me
Without your light I'm here drowning in the dark
I pick up the phone then I come straight to my senses
I know the consequences of going that far
Old, old habits die hard

I said goodbye when you let go
Still I hold on to all I've known
Wherever I am there you are
These old, old habits die hard

I say goodnight to an empty space beside me
The only reply is the beat of my heart
