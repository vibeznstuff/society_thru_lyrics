S Boy, you're host for the day
Don't let me waste my money

No, I see a new path, I can make half
Making new money now I got a new laugh, ha
Music is playing me well
So I ain't gonna be the one to go and find a new craft

I'm alright, if it ain't for you to find a new path
If you can't hack it better find a new class
Triple Akon gotta find a new pass
Drive me not to do it when I'm buying new cars

All I really want is money in my pocket
Cash in my hand, oh, skrilla in my wallet
All I really want is money in my pocket
Cash in my hand and skrilla in my wallet, yeah

Skrilla in my wallet
I want skrilla in my wallet
Yeah, yeah, skrilla in my wallet
Yeah, yeah, skrilla in my wallet

A dog gets one, he puts away half
So when I get one, I'm gonna put away half
I make money slow, I make money fast
Then I'm back to the hood so I can have the last laugh

Still laughing 'cause I know I'm not a half heart
When we release we don't wanna half chart
The IQ is high, some of them are half smart
But I do it like Ronson hard days craft

All I really want is money in my pocket
Cash in my hand, oh, skrilla in my wallet
All I really want is money in my pocket
Cash in my hand and skrilla in my wallet, yeah

Skrilla in my wallet
I want skrilla in my wallet
Yeah, yeah, skrilla in my wallet
Yeah, yeah, skrilla in my wallet

All I really want is money in my pocket
Cash in my hand, oh, skrilla in my wallet
All I really want is money in my pocket
Cash in my hand and skrilla in my wallet, yeah

Skrilla in my wallet
I want skrilla in my wallet
Yeah, yeah, skrilla in my wallet
Yeah, yeah, skrilla in my wallet
