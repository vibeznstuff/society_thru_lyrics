Fall into you, is all I seem to do..
When i hit the bottle, coz I'm afraid to be alone.
Tear us in two, is all it seems to do..

As the anger fades, this house is no longer a home,
Don't give up on the dream, don't give up on the wanting, and everything that's true.
Don't give up on the dream, don't give up on the wanting..

Because I want you too,
because I want you too,
because I want you too,
because I want you,
because I want you.

Stumble into you, is all i ever do..
My memory's hazy..and I'm afraid to be alone.
Tear us in two, is all it's gonna do..

As the headache fades, this house is no longer a home,
don't give up on the dream, don't give up, ont he wanting,
and everythign that's true.
don't give up on the dream, don't give up on the wanting..

Because I want you too,
because I want you too,
because I want you too,
because I want you,
because I want you.

Fall in to you, is all i ever do!
When i hit the bottle, coz I'm afraid to be alone..tear us in two, tear us in two, tear us in two..

Because I want you too,
because I want you too,
because I want you,
because I want you.
Because I want you too,
because I want you too,
because I want you,
because I want you.
