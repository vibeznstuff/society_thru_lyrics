Scratch the surface serve a purpose 
scratch the surface don't waste my time 

Such empty life
night after night 
all hidden faults
such shallow sight

Such simple sheep
herd to the creeps
beauty is null 
barely skin deep 

What is the force that drives the superficial 
tell me what keeps their minds remaining little 
What is the force that drives the superficial 
tell me what keeps their minds remaining
so afraid of what they'd see underneath the fantasy
so afraid to actually scratch the surface

Scratch the surface serve a purpose 
scratch the surface don't waste my time 

All mirrors hide
failure inside 
that's maybe why
they take so much time

Big money lies
big lying eyes
eyes are the soul
big dollar signs

What is the force that drives the superficial 
tell me what keeps their minds remaining little 
What is the force that drives the superficial 
tell me what keeps their minds remaining
so afraid of what they'd see underneath the fantasy
so afraid to actually scratch the surface

Scratch the surface serve a purpose 
scratch the surface don't waste my time
