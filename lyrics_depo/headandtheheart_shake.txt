Well the ink in my pen ran dry long before your smile
And the pages have always been blank like the trees in the wild
But the wind yes the wind keeps pushing you to me
Time being time I know when it's time to leave

And the memories we've made
Will never be lost, no
And the look on your face
We both knew the cost
But the wind yes the wind keeps
Howlin'

I put in the pictures, you put in the time
You put all those memories so deep inside my mind
Now the wind yes the wind keeps pushing you to me
Time being time I know when it's time to leave

And the memories we've made
Will never be lost, no
And the look on your face
We both knew the cost
But the wind yes the wind keeps
Howlin'

Even if it was a mistake, I can't forget your face
Even if it was just a day, you won't forget the one
Who's making you shake

Come around, I lost my way to see
Come around, I lost my way to see
Come around, I lost my way to see
Come around, I lost my way to see

Even if it was a mistake, I can't forget your face
Even if it was just a day, you won't forget the man
Who's making you shake

Who's making you shake
You shake
I'm making you shake
You shake
I'm making you shake
