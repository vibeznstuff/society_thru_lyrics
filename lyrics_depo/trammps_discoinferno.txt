(Burn baby burn)
(Burn baby burn)
(Burn baby burn)
(Burn baby burn)

To my surprise one hundred storeys high
People getting loose y'all
Getting down on the roof
Folks are screaming out of control
It was so entertaining
When the boogie started to explode
I heard somebody say

(Burn baby burn) disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) burn that mother down
(Burn baby burn) disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) burn that mother down

Satisfaction came in a chain reaction
(Burnin)
I couldn't get enough
So I had to self-destruct
The heat was on, rising to the top
Everybody is going strong
And that is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say

(Burn baby burn) disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) burn that mother down
(Burn baby burn) disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) burn that mother down

Up above my head
I hear music in the air
That makes me know
There's a party somewhere

Satisfaction came in a chain reaction
I couldn't get enough
So I had to self-destruct
The heat was on, rising to the top
Everybody is going strong
And that is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say

(Burn baby burn) disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) burn that mother down
(Burn baby burn) disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) burn that mother down
