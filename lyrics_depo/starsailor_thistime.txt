In that moment I was frozen out
Of a story that I knew all about
Then I called her in the evening
My depression started lifting

I won't let it kill me
This time
I won't let it kill me 
This time

Up to the surface came a feeling
Left me useless
Left me reeling

I won't let it kill me
This time
I won't let it kill me 
This time
When the beats run dry there's gonna be some blood


I won't let it kill me
This time
I won't let it kill me 
This time
