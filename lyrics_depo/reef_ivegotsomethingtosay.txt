I've got something to say;
We have come a long way.
After all the things that we have been through,
I'm glad still to have you.
I know your hurting, I know your hurting
It will get better every day.

I Love all that you are.
You are what I live for.
After all the things that we have been through,
I still don't have you.
I know your hurting, I know your hurting
It will get better every day.

I know your hurting, I know your hurting
It will get better every day.
