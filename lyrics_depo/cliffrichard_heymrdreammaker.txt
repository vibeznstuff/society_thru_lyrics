Josie's gone now
She cried a lot
Had to go away
And though I miss her
I want to kiss her
Ain't it just the way
But it's no way at all
'Cos if you knew what I'm goin'
Through you'd know
That there's one thing wrong
With the way I'm living
Ain't got no Josie no-more

Hey Mr. Dream Maker send me a dream
This one is over it's not what it seamed
And so tonight when I turn out the light
Send me a new dream tonight, ooh

She didn't say much
Just a little touch
And she was on her way
Ooh I could have cried then
Instead I died then
She left me standing dazed
But it's no use crying
Well that's what everybody
Tells me and they all seem to know
That there's one thing wrong
With the way I'm living
Ain't got no Josie no-more

Hey Mr. Dream Maker send me a dream
This one is over it's not what it seamed
And so tonight when I turn out the light
Send me a new dream tonight

Ooh, hey Mr., ooh, hey Mr.
Hey Mr. Dream Maker

Mr. Dream Maker send me a dream
This one is over it's not what it seamed
And so tonight when I turn out the light
Send me a new dream tonight

Aaahhh, send me a new dream tonight

Hey Mr. Dream Maker send me a dream
This one is over it's not what it seamed
And so tonight when I turn out the light
Send me a new dream tonight

Aah, send me a new dream tonight....
