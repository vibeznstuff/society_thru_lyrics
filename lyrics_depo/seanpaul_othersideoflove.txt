Baby, you don't have to keep looking through my phone
If something's going on, girl, you'd already know
We can't even say two words without a fight anymore
How did we get here? Baby, I gotta know

On the other side of love
You tell me you hate me and I hate you more
On the other side of love
How did we get here? Baby, I gotta know

Hey, baby girl
I'm giving it
Is a thing what you get with love
Trust and good live with it
So listen me and just believe I make stop from war
Like we are enemy
'Cause most definite
Without you in my life, my girl, it would be desperate
Come I can't forget all the times when you had my back
Girl, you get me medicine hundred percent
So I represent and you represent
I'm the president, you're my first lady
Girl, you heaven sent, I'm your first baby

I told you girl when you first met me
It's a crazy world. Nothing comes free

Baby, you don't have to keep looking through my phone
If something's going on, girl, you'd already know
We can't even say two words without a fight anymore
How did we get here? Baby, I gotta know

On the other side of love
You tell me you hate me and I hate you more
On the other side of love
How did we get here? Baby, I gotta know

Girl, I remember when you first gave it up
And we began to first live it up
I steer it up, I gave it up
We came to love with no fear in up
But now you ain't seeing clear enough
Yeah, you look in my phone and tearing up
And tell me you want to swear enough
Me, I tell you what we share is us

I told you girl, when you first met me,
It's a crazy world. Nothing comes free

Baby, you don't have to keep looking through my phone
If something's going on, girl you'd already know
We can't even say two words without a fight anymore
How did we get here? Baby, I gotta know

On the other side of love
You tell me you hate me and I hate you more
On the other side of love
How did we get here? Baby, I gotta know

Oh oh oh oh oh 

Baby, you don't have to keep looking through my phone
If something's going on, girl, you'd already know
