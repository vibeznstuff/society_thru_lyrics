You got me, you got me
Won’t you come over, I see you're alone
Baby Girl, don't need to stand on your own
Don’t be shy, just step into my zone
Me nah gon' diss you girl

Sweet talker just cool with your charm
Don’t bring no drama, don’t raise my alarm
I’m not a trophy to hang on your arm
You not gon' miss mi boy,

You can’t blame a man for trying
So I cannot deny it
For the moment you arrive
Ohhh

You've got my heart drunk and incapable
I beg you please don’t leave me miserable
Drunk and incapable
Nah you've got my heart drunk and incapable
You make my head spin out of control
Drunk &amp; incapable

I love your figure Miss bum digi bum
Skins so clear, just been kissed by the sun
Eyes so bright, so they can stop anyone
Me not gon' diss you girl
Me not gon' diss you

I must admit the way you ride di riddim
Makes my heart go rom-po-po-pom
Just me and you, can’t see anyone
Me not gon' diss you boy,
Me not gon' diss you boy

You can’t blame a man for trying
So i cannot deny it
For the moment you arrive
Ohhh

You've got my heart drunk and incapable
I beg you please don’t leave me miserable
Drunk and incapable
Nah you've got my heart drunk and incapable
You make my head spin out of control
Drunk &amp; incapable
