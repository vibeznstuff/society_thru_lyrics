There’s a half a million sunsets I haven’t got to show you.
Don’t ask me how I know, but I know they steal your breath.
And I can almost feel the feeling that you’re gonna give me,
especially when you kiss me like no one ever has.
It’s so real I can’t explain it, keep me waiting.

You could be in Dallas or L.A., 30,000 feet upon a plane.
You could be the dream that I’ve always chased, every second, every place,
always looking for your face and I know it’s one I’ll never forget.
So I guess I haven’t met you yet.

I saw two people talking in a corner booth cafe,
all looking so in love thinking that could be us someday.
I don’t know what you're doing, I don’t know where you are,
but I swear girl when I meet ya, you already have my heart.

You could be in Dallas or L.A., 30,000 feet up on a plane.
You could be the dream that I’ve always chased, every second, every place,
always looking for your face and I know it’s one I’ll never forget.
So I guess I haven’t met you yet.

Not yet I still haven’t got to hold you.
Not yet I’m still tossing around this bed.
Not yet I want you in my arms and out of my head.

You could be in Dallas or L.A., 30,000 feet up on a plane.
Wherever you are girl I’m on my way, every second, every place,
always looking for your face and I know it’s one I’ll never forget.
So I guess I haven’t met you yet.

I haven’t met you, haven’t met you, haven’t met you.
I haven’t met you, haven’t met you, haven’t met you yet.
