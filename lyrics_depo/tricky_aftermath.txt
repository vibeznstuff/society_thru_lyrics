For world, for someone
For him, for she
For world, for someone
For him, for me

Your eyes resemble mine, you see as no others can
Here inherit my kingdom, speak of our people's plan
I'll be here for my baby, for my baby I'll be near
So many things I need to tell you, things you need to hear

So this is the aftermath

Your eyes resemble mine, you see as no others can
Here inherit my kingdom, speak of our people's plan
I'll be here for my baby, for my baby I'll be near
So many things I need to tell you

For world, for someone
For him, for she
For world, for someone
For him, for me

"Let me tell you about my mother" 

For world, for someone
For him, for she
For world, for someone
For him, for me

Your eyes resemble mine, you see as no others can
Here inherit my kingdom, speak of our people's plan
I'll be here for my baby, for my baby I'll be near
So many things I need to tell you, things you need to hear

How can I be sure
In a world that's constantly changing?
How can I be sure

How can I be sure
In a world that's constantly changing?
How can I
How can I be sure?

Just when I thought I was winning
Just when I thought I could not be stopped
Just when I thought I was winning
Just when I thought I could not be stopped
How can I be sure?
