Last night,
She brought me to,
The state of mind,
In an empty room.

White light,
The kiss of life,
A and E,
On a Saturday night.

You count stars,
In green and blue,
Have dreams,
Stuffed with things you knew.

It's too late,
Can't you see,
You're sweet,
And love's got a hold on me,
So come on!

Don't stop, and don't look back,
Cos your love's like a heart attack,
Come on!

So late,
Hard and cold,
Sweet love, how you suffer so,
Pink moon, colours you,
Shot down but I feel for you,
So come on!

Don't stop, and don't look back,
Cos your love's like a heart attack,
Come on!

I can't stop, no I can't turn back,
Feel your love like a heart attack,
Come on!

Don't stop, and don't look back,
Cos your love's like a heart attack,
Come on!

I can't stop, I can't turn back,
Feel your love like a heart attack,
Come on!
