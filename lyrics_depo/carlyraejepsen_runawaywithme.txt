You're stuck in my head, stuck on my heart, stuck on my body, body
I wanna go, get out of here, I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away
I'd run away with you

This is the part, you've got to say all that you're feeling, feeling
Packing a bag, we're leaving tonight when everyone's sleeping, sleeping
Let's run away
I'll run away with you

Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I found your lips in the street lights
I wanna be there with you

Oh baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner, in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Oh baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero, I'm willing
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me

Up in the clouds, high as a kite, over the city, city
We never sleep, we never tried, when you are with me, with me
I wanna stay
I wanna stay here with you

Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I found your lips in the street lights
I wanna be there with you

Oh baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner, in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Oh baby, every single limit
I'll be your hero, I'm winning
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me

Hold on to me
I'll never want to let you go
(Run away with me, run away with me)
Over the weekend
We can turn the world to gold, oh oh
(Run away with me, run away with me)

(We can turn the world to gold)
Over the weekend we can turn the world to gold
Oh oh, oh

Ooh my baby, take me to the feeling
(Take me to, take me to it)
I'll be your sinner, in secret

When the lights go out
Run away with me
(Just run away)
Run away with me
(With me)
(Oh yeah yeah)
Every single minute
I'll be your hero, I'm willing
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me

Run away with me
Run away with me

Run away with me
Run away with me
