Hey, now I call it a split 'cause I know that you will
Uh, oh, you bite your friends like chocolate
And you said, "We go where nobody knows, we got guns hidden under our petticoats.
No, we're never gonna quit it, no, we're never gonna quit it, no."

Now run, run away from the boys in the blue,
Oh, my car smells like chocolate
Hey, now I think about what to do, I think about what to say, I think about how to think
Pause it, play it, pause it, play it, pause it

Oh, we go where nobody knows, we've guns hidden under our petticoats
We're never gonna quit it, no, we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe,
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats.
No, we're never gonna quit it, no, we're never gonna quit it, no

"Now, you're never gonna quit it, now you're never gonna quit it, now you're never gonna quit it
If you don't stop smoking it," that's what she said.
She said, "We're dressed in black, head to toe.
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats.
And "We're never gonna quit it, no, we're never gonna quit it, no."

Hey, now we're building up speed as we're approaching the hill
Oh, my hair smells like chocolate
Hey, now you say you're gonna quit it but you're never gonna quit it
Go get it, go get it, go get it, go get it, go
And play it cool!

Oh, you said we go where nobody knows, we've guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it, no, we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe,
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats
We're never gonna quit it, no, we're never gonna quit it, no

Well, I think we better go,
Seriously better go
Said the feds are here you know
Seriously better go, oh, oh,

Well, I think we better go
Said the feds are here you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go

We go where nobody knows, we've guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it, no, we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe,
We've guns hidden under our petticoats
We're never gonna quit it, no, we're never gonna quit it, no
No, no, no

Well, I think we better go,
Seriously better go
Said the feds are here you know
Seriously better go, oh, oh,

Well, I think we better go
Said the feds are here you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go
