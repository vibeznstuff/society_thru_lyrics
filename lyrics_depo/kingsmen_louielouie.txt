Louie, Louie, oh no, I said we gotta go
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I said
Louie, Louie, oh baby, I said we gotta go

A fine little girl, she waits for me
Me catch a ship across the sea
Me sail that ship all alone
Me never think how I'll make it home

Louie, Louie, no, no, no, no, no, I said we gotta go
Oh no, I said
Louie, Louie, oh baby, I said we gotta go

Three nights and days I sail the sea
I think of girl constantly
On that ship, I dream she there
I smell the rose in her hair

Louie, Louie, oh no, I said we gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I said 
Louie, Louie, oh baby, I said we gotta go

Okay, let's give it to 'em, right now! 

Me see
Me see Jamaican moon above
It won't be long me see me love
Me take her in my arms and then
I tell her I'll never leave again

Louie, Louie, oh no, I said we gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I said
Louie, Louie, oh baby, I said we gotta go

I said we gotta go now

Let's get on outta here

Let's go!
