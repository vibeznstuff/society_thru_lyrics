Hello, may I have this dance with you? 

How have you been, girl? 
Hold me, and then girl 
Just let me look at you. 
Tell me, now, is it true? 

Oh, did you break up? 
No chance to make up. 
I hate to take up all your time, 
But tell me. 

Oh, no it won't be repeated. 
You mean to tell me he cheated? 
Oh, what a fool he's been 
Though he is, my best friend 

I hate it this way, 
But I've waited for this day. 
I've always wanted 
You to be my girl. 

Be my girl, you're my girl. 
I still don't believe it 
He played around on you. 
When all the time he knew 
I loved you too 

With your big eyes, full lips, 
High cheek bones, 
And ev'rything about you, girl. 
Personality girl, 
Gimme a chance, come on, 
Let's dance,some 
Dance the night away; 

You're my girl.you're my girl, you're my girl. 
Baby doll, baby, baby, hold me tight. 
Be mine tonight, say it's alright. 
And I will never, ever let you go, oh... 
Be my girl, be my girl, 
You're my girl.
You're mine, 
You're my girl.
