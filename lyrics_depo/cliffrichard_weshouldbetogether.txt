We should be together for Christmas
Together with the ones we love
The ones we care for
We should be together for Christmas
And be there with the ones we love
And not be far away
That's why they invented planes
So we could fly away
To the ones we love
And be there for this day

We should be together for Cristmas
It isn't right to be apart
We could be here wild in our wishes
With all the love that's in my heart
I want you to be here
That's why they invented trains
So you could ride away
To the one you love
And be here for this day
We should be together

And it never matters where
Anyplace... we don't care
Long as we both are there

That's why they invented stars

I got no need for Cars
Just a wish and I could be there
Where you are
