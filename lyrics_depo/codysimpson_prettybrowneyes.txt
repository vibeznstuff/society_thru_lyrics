(Go to sleep, wake up
You're pretty with no make-up)
I like this right here
(Go to sleep, wake up
You're pretty with no make-up)

This girl she came 'round
The corner, looking like a model
Magazine figure, she was shaped like a bottle
Long straight hair, she was fly as a bird
First time ever I was lost for words

Felt so right, it just couldn't be wrong
Love at first sight if that exists at all
I couldn't move, felt like I was stuck
And then baby girl looked up

And I said hey there pretty brown eyes
What you doin' later tonight?
Would you mind if I spend time with you?
And I said hey there pretty brown eyes
What you doin' later tonight?
Would you mind if I spend time with you?

(Go to sleep, wake up.
You're pretty with no make-up.
Go to sleep, wake up.
You're pretty with.)

This girl she was a little hottie,
She know she got it
Came from the city so she loves to party
The JT song make her move that body
She dancing all night long

Cause I can tell that she was a wild one
That's why I was shy at first,
But I finally worked up the nerve

And I said hey there pretty brown eyes
What you doin' later tonight?
Would you mind if I spend time with you?
And I said hey there pretty brown eyes
What you doin' later tonight?
Would you mind if I spend time with you?

Spend a little bit, a little bit of time with you
Spend a little bit, a little bit of time with you
Spend a little little bit, a bit of time with you
Spend a little bit, a little bit of time with you

Like hey hey little pretty brown eyes
Don't you ever be looking at them other guys
'Cause ain't never had a surfer like me
Start swimming over here and ride my wave
'Cause I see that you party like there's no tomorrow
Let's leave the party, I'll grab my guitar
I got the keys, so jump in my car
Sit back relax, Australia's kinda far

Hey there pretty brown eyes
What you doin' later tonight?
would you mind if I spend time with you?
And I said hey there pretty brown eyes
What you doin' later tonight?
would you mind if I spend time with you?

Spend a little bit, a little bit of time with you
Spend a little bit, a little bit of time with you
Spend a little little little bit of time with you
Spend a little bit, a little bit of time with you

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
