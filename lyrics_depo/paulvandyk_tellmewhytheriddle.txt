Tell me why, tell me why

If I could open my heart again
(if I could, if I could, if I could)
Must be me why I feel like smile again
If I could open my heart again
(heart again, heart again)
Must be me why I feel like smile again

The morning comes and the snow is falling 

Tell me why, tell me why
Tell me why, tell me why

The morning comes and the snow is falling
The morning comes and the snow is falling

The morning comes
I can understand the reason
And snow the is falling (tell me why)
