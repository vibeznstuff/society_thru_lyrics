The world was on fire, and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd need somebody like you
I never dreamed that I'd miss somebody like you

And I wanna fall in love
And I wanna fall in love with you
with you

What a wicked game you play, you make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do, make me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say, never felt that way
What a wicked thing to do, make me dream of you

And I wanna fall in love
And I wanna fall in love with you
with you

My world was on fire, and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd need somebody like you
I never dreamed that I'd miss somebody like you

And I wanna fall in love
And I wanna fall in love
And I wanna fall in love with you
with you

Nobody loves no one
