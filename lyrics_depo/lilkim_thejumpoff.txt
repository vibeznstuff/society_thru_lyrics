Goons in the club in case somethin jumps off
And back up before the hive let the pump off
In the graveyard is where you get dumped off
All we wanna do is party (Woo!)
And buy everybody at the bar Bacardi (Woo!)
Black Barbie dressed in Bvlgari

Our presence is felt like a Black Panther movement
Seven quarter to eights back to back with 'em (Back to back)
And I'm sittin on chrome seven times platinum


This is for my peeps, with the Bentley's, the Hummers, the Benz
Escalades twenty three inch rims (Oh!)
Jumping out the Jaguar with the Tims, keep it real
And live good, East coast West coast worldwide
All my players in the hood stay fly
And if your balling let me hear you say ride (ride)

How I make a Sprite can disappear in my mouth....HO!!!!
Shake up the dice, throw down your ice (What)
Bet it all player fuck the price
Money ain't a thing throw it out like rice
Been around the world cop the same thing twice
Rub on my tits (Huh!) squeeze on my ass (Oh!)
Gimme some UH!!! step on the gas (Ah)
Pop the cork and roll up the hash (Roll it!)
You know what we about, sex, drugs and cash

Buttnaked dressed in nothing but pearls

Shake your body body, move your body body (Body body)
On the dancefloor don't hurt nobody body (Body body)
