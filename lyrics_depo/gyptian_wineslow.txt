Baby you really look good
I got ask you what you use on your skin
Baby tell me how you skin so smooth

Move cautiously
Baby sometimes on the spot

Move cautiously
Baby sometimes on the spot

Cautiously, baby I love it like dat

Cause when you dress up in you two piece &amp; short shorts
Baby you really look good
I got ask you what you use on your skin
Baby tell me how you skin so smooth

'Cause when you wine slow on me
You tic toc on me
Baby I love it like dat
I want you move hard pon me
Move cautiously
Baby sometimes on the spot
