You never alter
You're always you
Everything's breaking
But I don't care
Smash the rest up
Burn it down
Put us in the corner 'cus we're into ideas

Take these edges
They're inside out
No one will notice
They're looking elsewhere
We can't be honest
We call it off
We got the choice if it all goes wrong

We walk, we walk
We walk, we walk

You see the changes
In things that come
It's how you deal with it
When switching off
Make a decision
A precondition
We got the choice if it all goes wrong

We walk, we walk
We walk, we walk

When nothing makes you feel good
Then nothing makes you feel good
