Oopsy daisy I hurt you again
Crushed your heart in the palm of my hands
If you walk out baby I'll understand
'Cause all I'll do is hurt you again

Yeah, and again, and again, oops, there we go again
We messed up once
I messed up twice
How many times are we gonna try again
Girl it's like round and round we go
 I'd prefer if you left me alone
'Cause I can't take the pain and my heartbeat feels like an 808

I'm a walking disaster
Don't wanna hurt you that's why you got to go
Destruction like fire on the ground
Thats why you got to go, oh oh oh ohhh

Yeah
See the fussin and fightin, lets not
Before I see red, lets stop
This here's really the end of
I'ma find cupid and put him in a headlock
Now why did you pick on me
Why let the pretty bird shit on me
I don't need good luck but I need good love
Thats a girl that will stand by me
Look honey I didn't diss you
Therefore I shouldn't have to miss you
And now I feel like Saturdays are weaker
Me and my heart got crazy issues

And my girl it's like round and round we go, 
 I'll prefer if you left me alone
'Cause I can't take the pain
And my heartbeat feels like an 808

Oopsy daisy I hurt you again
Crushed your heart in the palm of my hands
If you walk out baby I'll understand
'Cause all I'll do is hurt you again

I'm a walking disaster
Don't wanna hurt you thats why you got to go
Destruction like fire on the ground
Thats why you got to go, oh oh oh ohh

Yeah
They say three times a lady
I say three times you're crazy
To done with the messin' around
Baseball love, three strikes you're out
You're too busy tryna' catch me out
But I just wanna get home
The touring, after a while gets boring
I need to come back to your touch
Look it's all too much
I guess now we gotta let go
You see me grow from a boy to a man
So this must really be the end of the road

And girl its like round and round we go, 
 I'd prefer if you left me alone
'Cause I can't take the pain
and my heartbeat feels like an 808

I'm a walking disaster
Don't wanna hurt you that's why you got to go
Destruction like fire on the ground
Thats why you got to go

Oopsy daisy I hurt you again
Crushed your heart in the palm of my hands
If you walk out baby I'll understand
'Cause all I'll do is hurt you again
