Right about now you'll find me on the highway
Pointin' my thumb at all the cars going my way
Right about here you'll see me gettin' weary
I got no one left to keep me warm and cheery


But the thought of comin' home
Keeps me goin' strong
Keeping me holding on
Singin' la la la la dee da 
All the boys in the city were cold, hard and pretty
Singin' la la la la dee da

Right about now I can taste that old home cookin'
Smackin' my lips I see it, not even lookin'
Right about here I hear my baby laughin'
And, I'm losing my mind havin' the thoughts I'm havin'



Right about here a stranger waves "Come with me"
And, I run like a rabbit I can't let him miss me?
The stranger asks me, "Where's my destination?"
So, I tell him and he says "Sorry, wrong direction."



Come on and sing now...
