I make hitz, not the public
I tell the DJs what to play! Understand?

Baa baa black sheep, rock star, rap G
Make enough dough to own a black card, that's deep
I've been getting real fucking friendly with the banks man
And I don't mean Phil, Carlton, Hilary or Ashley.
Papz see me up in the vicinity and flash me
I'm the definition of definitive and catchy
The only thing that's bigger, quicker, slicker
More black and more uppper London is a taxi

Bitch I'm so sick, I need a mother fucking vaccine
Picky ring style like some mother fucking vaseline
Centre of attention like a Bang &amp; Olufsen
HD in vision for a flat screen
The only ever time I see you niggers on kisses is like 2am or when you go to pucker up
Look 60 M4 babe you need to buckle up
All my women so zoo, all my women so nuts

So raw and uncut no fucking edits
She won't even get a hype, she made no fucking effort
And all you silly singers and you ring tone rappers
Like school dinner curries
Don't fucking get it

My car is a unleaded
Got a yard with a terrace
She called me chauvinistic
But she can't even spell it
I don't wanna hear another nigga say you fly
If you ain't never been on business class on the Emirates

I'm a racket, I'm tennis
I'm Dennis, I'm a menace
Call me Rob Pattinson, I got a lot of niggas jealous
I'm a mentos mint in a can of Dr Pepper
That's tick, tick, tick, tick, boom to you fellas

It's so important that your mighty Nigella
A'int lipsin' if her name a'int Remi or stella
Got a big bag of tricks and Mary Poppin's umbrella
Cause we're 'bout to rain on them like London weather
