I don’t know what I should say
To get a woman like you to look my way
All I know is just how I feel
And it’s forever like Texas, stronger than steel

Lead me into your heart
Don’t let this world keep us apart
Don’t leave me alone in the dark
Lead me into your heart

A woman’s heart is a river runnin’ wild
Tougher than a cowboy,
Tender as a child
It’s a mystery a man can’t understand,
So, baby, help me, take my hand

Lead me into your heart
Don’t let this world keep us apart
Don’t leave me alone in the dark
Lead me into your heart

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Girl, I know we got our scars
Beautiful and broken, just the way we are
With a little faith and a whole lot of trust
I’d bet it all on you, bet it all on us

So lead me into your heart
Don’t let this world keep us apart
Don’t leave me alone in the dark
Lead me into your heart
Lead me into your heart
