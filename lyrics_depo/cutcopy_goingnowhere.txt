I can't think straight
Help me now before it's too late
Now what do I care?
'Cause we're going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
I can go there
I can go there

I can't think straight
Help me now before it's too late
Now what do I care?
'Cause we're going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Help me!

Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
I can go there
I can go there
I can go there
