None of your friends come near you
They've given up trying to steer you
Because your turning away
Turning away from love

Lately you look so ragged
The edge of your hearts become jagged
And your turning away
Turning away from love

I say your turning away turning away from love
I say your turning away turning away from love
Well she gives it to you without asking
A piece of her heart ever lasting
But your turning away
Turning away from love

Just when this old world needs all of the love it can get
Your turning away
Turning away from the one who really cares
Your turning away from love

I say your turning away
Turning away from love
Turning away
Turning away from love
Well she gives it to you without asking
A piece of her heart ever lasting
But your turning away
Turning away from love

I say your turning away
Turning away from love
Turning away
Turning away from love
