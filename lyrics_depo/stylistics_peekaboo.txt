Every single day
As you pass this way
I know just what to say
But I can't find
The words to tell you
Each and every day
My love grows and grows
More than before

So maybe, I'll just say

Oh!!!! Oh!!! Peek-A-Boooooo!!!!!
Guess who's watching you
Oh!!!! Oh!!! Peek-A-Booooo!!!!
Guess who's loving you
Oh!!!! Oh!!! Peek-A-Boooooo!!!!!
Guess who's watching you

Can't you realize
As you pass me by
the love that's in my heart
So what's keeping us apart
Even though I know
I will win your heart
I'll wait just one more day
Just to see you

Oh!!!! Oh!!! Peek-A-Boooooo!!!!!
Guess who's watching you
Oh!!!! Oh!!! Peek-A-Booooo!!!!
Guess who's loving you
Oh!!!! Oh!!! Peek-A-Boooooo!!!!!
Guess who's watching you

I'll wait just
One more day
Just to see you!!!!!!

Oh!!!! Oh!!! Peek-A-Boooooo!!!!!
Guess who's watching you
Oh!!!! Oh!!! Peek-A-Booooo!!!!
Guess who's loving you
Oh!!!! Oh!!! Peek-A-Boooooo!!!!!
Guess who's watching you
