Are you ready maybe
Are you willing to run
Are you ready to let yourself drown
Are you holding your breath
Are you ready or not

Are you ready maybe
Do you long to confess
Do you feel that you're already numb
Are you sure of yourself
Would you lie if you're not

You tire me out
Don't wanna let that happen
A secret scream so loud
Why did you let that happen

Ooh ooh so put your arms around me
You let me believe that you are someone else
Ooh ooh cause only time can take you
So let me believe
That I am somewhere else

Maybe, are you ready to break
Do you think that I push you too far
Would you open yourself
Are you reckless or not

You tire me out
Don't wanna let that happen
A secret scream so loud
Why did you let that happen

Ooh ooh so put your arms around me
You let me believe that you are someone else
Ooh ooh cause only time can take you
So let me believe
That I am somewhere else
That I am somewhere else

Sha na na na na
Sha na na na na
Sha na na na na
Sha na na na na

Sha na na na na
Sha na na na na
Sha na na na na
Sha na na na na

Sha na na na na

Ooh ooh so put your arms around me
Ooh ooh so put your arms around me

Make me believe
Take me take me
Somewhere
Somewhere
Let me believe
Cause only time can take you
So stop
