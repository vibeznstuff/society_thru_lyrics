(Outta control)

You're gone, now, I feel fine
17 months, yeah I feel fine
What about you? I betcha been cryin'
I bet ya been goin around town lyin'

I'm drivin' fast, I feel so fine
I got Prince singin' Hot Thing to me
I know every line
So I pulled up to the red light, sittin' here in my car
I look up to my right, and there you are

Sat there with some new girl, what is this?
(Don't panic, panic, Mutya don't drive erratic)
That's who has replaced me, what a diss
(Don't panic, panic, don't act too manic, manic)
It's a sure fine way to ruin my day
Just as soon as I'm on top of my life, there you are again
But don't react now, you can't go back now
Don't panic, panic, Mutya, just look ahead now

(Outta control)

Let's cut to it, my girl for lunch
I was feelin' on top of the world, and I just got a hunch
That you were sat behind my back, didn't need to turn 'round
I felt sick at the thought, you're laughing loud

Sat there with some new girl, what is this?
(Don't panic, panic, Mutya don't drive erratic)
That's who has replaced me, what a diss
(Don't panic, panic, don't act too manic, manic)
It's a sure fine way to ruin my day
Just as soon as I'm on top of my life, there you are again
But don't react now, you can't go back now
Don't panic, panic, Mutya, just look ahead now

(Outta control)

It's a sure fine way to ruin my day
Just as soon as I'm on top of my life, there you are again
But don't react now, you can't go back now
Don't panic, panic, Mutya, just look ahead now ...
