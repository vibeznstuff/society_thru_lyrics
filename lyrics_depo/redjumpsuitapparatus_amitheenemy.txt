In a world that is full of greed and pain
Where the politicians have free reign
To wear you down
This is what I've found

They will never lay a hand on us
They will never understand in what we trust
Is so much stronger, oh
I don't know if I'll make it
I don't know if I'll make it through

Is it all in my head, all in my head?
These memories gone bad
Don't turn away from your past
Am I the enemy
All in my head, all in my head
These memories gone bad
Don't turn away from your past
Am I the enemy

I'm reaching out to you
I have no doubt that you'll pull through
So take your place
This is a game we play

They will never lay a hand on us
They will never understand in what we trust
Is so much stronger, oh
I don't know if I'll make it
I don't know if I'll make it through

Is it all in my head, all in my head?
These memories gone bad
Don't turn away from your past
Am I the enemy
All in my head, all in my head
These memories gone bad
Don't turn away from your past
Am I the enemy
Am I the enemy
Am I the enemy

Sing with me
Sing, sing with me
Sing with me
Sing, sing with me
Sing with me
Sing, sing with me
Am I the enemy
Am I the enemy
Am I the enemy

Is it all in my head, all in my head?
These memories gone bad
Don't turn away from your past
Am I the enemy
Is it all in my head, all in my head?
These memories gone bad
Don't turn away from your past
Am I the enemy
Is it all in my head, all in my head?
These memories gone bad
Don't turn away from your past
Am I the enemy
Is it all in my head, all in my head?
These memories gone bad
Don't turn away from your past
Am I the enemy
Am I the enemy
Am I the enemy
