Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Oh the night, is my world
City light, painted girls,
In the day, nothing matters,
It's the night, time that flatters

In the night, no control
Through the wall, sound that's breaking,
Wearing White, as your walking,
Down the street, of my soul

You take my self; you take my self control,
You got me living only for the night,
Before the morning comes our stories told,
You take my self; you take my self control

Another night, another day goes by,
I never stop myself to wonder why,
You helped my forget to play my roll,
You take my self; you take my self control

I, I live among the creatures of the night,
I haven't got the will to try and fight,
Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it,
That tomorrow never comes

A safe night, I'm living in the forest of my dream 
I know the night is not as it would seem 
I must believe in something, so I'll make myself believe it,
That this night will never go

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Oh the night, is my world
City light, painted girls,
In the day, nothing matters,
It's the night, time that flatters

You take my self; you take my self control,
You got me living only for the night,
Before the morning comes our stories told,
You take my self; you take my self control

I, I live among the creatures of the night,
I haven't got the will to try and fight,
Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it, that tomorrow never knows

A safe night, I'm living in the forest of my dream 
I know the night is not as it would seem 
I must believe in something, so I'll make myself believe it,
That this night will never go

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh

You take my self; you take my self control,
You got me living only for the night,
Before the morning comes our stories told,
You take my self; you take my self control
