
I can`t stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can`t stand the rain
Against my window
Because here`s not here with me

Hey window pane
Do you remember
How sweet it used to be
When we were together
Everything was so grand
Now that we`ve parted
There`s one sound that I just can`t stand
