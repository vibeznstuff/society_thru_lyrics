I might, ooooh
I might just fall in love with you tonight
If your kiss linger still, and my lips sing it well
Then I just might

I could,
I could surrender in your arms tonight
Just hold me close once more, and kiss me like before
Then I just might

Lately I found, my resistance is down
Everytime when I look in your eyes
My head starts to spin, I try not to give in
But if you catch my heart by surprise

I might, ooooh
I might give up my heart without a fight
I never thought I would, but now I think I could
And I just might

What can I do, when a girl sweet as you
Can kiss all my defences away
Tonight you may find, that you made up my mind
Was it’s getting much harder to say

I might, ooooh
I might give up my heart without a fight
I never thought I would, but now I think I could
And I just might

I might, ooooh
I might just fall in love with you tonight
If your kiss linger still, and my lips sing it well
Then I just might

I could,
I could surrender in your arms tonight
Just hold me tight once more, and kiss me like before
Then I just might

I might, just fall in love with you tonight
I never thought I would, but now I think I could
And I just might
