Somebody wants you
Someone out there
Somebody needs you
Somebody cares
Somebody loves you
Someone somewhere
But if nobody's there

Here they come again
Whispers in my head
Same old sad refrain
Wished I'd never said
What I said... yeah
Take me to the top
I need more not less
And don't ever tell me when to stop

Here comes tomorrow
And yesterday's news
Empty and hollow
Broken and bruised
No one to follow, nothing to lose
And only you can choose

Somebody wants you
Someone out there
Somebody needs you
Somebody cares
Somebody loves you
Someone somewhere
But if nobody's there
