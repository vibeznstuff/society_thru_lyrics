The drugs they say make us feel so hollow 
We love in vain narcissistic and so shallow 
The cops and queers to swim you have to swallow 
Hate today, no love for tomorrow 

We're all stars now in the dope show 
We're all stars now in the dope show 


There's a lot of pretty, pretty ones 
That want to get you high 
But all the pretty, pretty ones 
Will leave you low and blow your mind 

We're all stars now in the dope show 
We're all stars now in the dope show 


They love you when you're on all the covers 
When you're not then they love another 

The drugs they say are made in California 
We love your face 
We'd really like to sell you 
The cops and queers make good-looking models 
I hate today 
Who will I wake up with tomorrow? 




They love you when you're on all the covers 
When you're not then they love another 



They'll blow your mind

We're all stars now in the dope show 
We're all stars now in the dope show
