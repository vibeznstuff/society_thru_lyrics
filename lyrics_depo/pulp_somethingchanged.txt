I wrote the song two hours before we met. 
I didn't know your name or what you looked like yet. 
Oh I could have stayed at home and gone to bed. 
I could have gone to see a film instead. 
You might have changed your mind and seen your friends 
Life could have been very different then but something changed. 
Do you believe that there's someone up above?
Does he have a timetable directing acts of love? 
Why did I write this song on that day? 
Why did you touch my hand and softly say. 
Stop asking questions that don't matter anyway. 
Just give us a kiss to celebrate here today something changed. 
When we woke up that morning we had no way of knowing 
That in a matter of hours we'd change the way we were going. 
Where would I be now if we'd never met. 
Would I be singing this song to someone else instead I dunno 
But like you said something changed.
