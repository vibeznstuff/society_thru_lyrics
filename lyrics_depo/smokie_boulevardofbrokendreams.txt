Walking in the rain, I can't believe the way I'm feeling;
Lonely once again, could it be that I'm still dreaming;
I thought I heard you talking,
But deep inside I know, this heart of mine has left me walking

Down the Boulevard of broken dreams,
Down the Boulevard of broken dreams,
You left me broken hearted, before we got things started
Rain keeps falling, or so it seems
Down the boulevard of broken dreams,
Don't leave me broken hearted, I don't wanna be on that
Boulevard of broken dreams

Burning in my heart, tells me now that it's all over;
It's tearing me apart, feeling that I'm sinking over;
I thought I heard you talking,
But deep inside I know, this heart of mine has left me walking

Down the Boulevard of broken dreams,
Down the Boulevard of broken dreams,
You left me broken hearted, I don't wanna be on that
Boulevard of broken dreams.

Walking in the rain, can't believe what I am seeing;
Is it you again, oh tell me baby I'm not dreaming,
'Cause I can hear you talking, no more will I be walking

Down the Boulevard of broken dreams,
Down the Boulevard of broken dreams,
You left me broken hearted, before we got things started
Rain keeps falling, or so it seems
Down the boulevard of broken dreams,
Don't leave me broken hearted, I don't wanna be on that
Boulevard of broken dreams
