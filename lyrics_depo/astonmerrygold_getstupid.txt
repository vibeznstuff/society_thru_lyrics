Take it out for sure.
Take a look at it nine to five,

Wow!

Here's an invitation to the whole wide world,
From your brother to your sister to your best friend's girl,
Can't excuse it,
No excuses,
Everybody get stupid.
Unpredictable and ready,
Never stuck and steady,
Once you get it then you won't let go.
Don't call it foolish,
I say it's coolish,
Everybody get stupid.

But it's not that hard to find,
It's all about you.

If you got money in your pocket,
It don't mean nothing,
If you ain't wearing it
If you ain't where it is.

Let 'em in,
Til it's late let 'em in.
