When you're in love with a beautiful woman 
It's hard 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman 
You know it's hard 

Everybody wants her 
Everybody loves her 
Everybody wants to take your baby home 

When you're in love with a beautiful woman 
You watch your friends 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman 
It never ends 
You know that it's crazy 
You want to trust her 
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman 
You go it alone 

Maybe it's just an ego problem 
Problem is, I've been fooled before 
By fair weathered friends and faint hearted lovers 
And everytime it happens 
It just convinces me more 

When you're in love with a beautiful woman 
You watch her eyes 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman 
You look for lies 
Everybody tempts her 
Everybody tells her 
She's the most beautiful woman they know 

When you're in love with a beautiful woman 
You go it alone 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman 
You watch your friends 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman 
Yeah it never ends 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman 
You watch her eyes 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman 
You keep looking for lies
