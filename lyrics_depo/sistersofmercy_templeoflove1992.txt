With the fire from the fireworks up above me
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain at hand
You run for cover in the temple of love
You run for another but still the same
For the wind will blow my name across this land
In the temple of love you hide together
Believing pain and fear outside
But someone near you rides the weather
And the tears he cried will rain on
Walls as wide as lovers' eyes

In the temple of love - shine like thunder
In the temple of love - cry like rain
In the temple of love - hear my calling
In the temple of love - hear my name

And the devil in a black dress watches over
My guardian angel walks away
Life is short and love is always over in the morning
Black wind come carry me far away
With the sunlight died and the night above me
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain inside
You run for cover in the temple of love
You run for another, it's all the same
For the wind will blow and throw your walls aside

With the fire from the fireworks up above
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain
You run for cover in the temple of love
I shine like thunder, cry like rain
And the temple of love grows old and strong
But the wind blows stronger, cold and long
And the temple of love will fall before this 
Black wind calls my name to you no more

In the black sky thunder sweeping under
Ground and over water, sounds of
Crying, weeping will not save your
Faith for bricks and dreams for mortar
All your prayers must seem as nothing
Ninety-six below the wave when 
Stone is dust and only air remains

In the temple of love - shine like thunder
In the temple of love - cry like rain
In the temple of love - hear the calling
In the temple of love - is falling down

In the temple of love - shine like thunder
In the temple of love - cry like rain
In the temple of love - hear my calling
In the temple of love - hear my name

In the black sky thunder sweeping under
Ground and over water, sounds of
Crying, weeping will not save your
Faith for bricks and dreams for mortar
All your prayers must seem as nothing
Ninety-six below the wave when
Stone is dust and air remains the
Only haven you can trust
And the devil in the black dress watches over
My guardian angel walks away
Life is short and love is always over in the morning
Black wind come carry me far away

With the fire from the fireworks up above
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain
You run for cover in the temple of love
I shine like thunder, cry like rain
And the temple of love grows old and strong
But the wind blows stronger, cold and long
And the temple of love will fall before this
Black wind calls my name to you no more

In the temple of love you hide together
Believing pain and fear outside
But someone near you rides the weather
And the tears he cried will rain on
Walls as wide as lovers' eyes

In the temple of love - shine like thunder
In the temple of love - cry like rain
In the temple of love - near the calling
And the temple of love - is falling down
