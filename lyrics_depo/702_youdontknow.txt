Yeah, 702, come on,
Soulshock, Karlin,
That's right.


Why'd you leave,
I gave you everything,
So why you wanna tell me lies?
You mean so much to me,
You know I can't believe,
That you have got me open like you do.


Now what've I got to do to make you see,
That we should be together you and me,
I want your love.
I get excited, can't fight it,
Baby you just don't know.


You don't know what you do,
Got me loving you,
So please don't go 'cuz,
You don't know what you do,
Got me all over you,
And I don't know what to do about us.



Can't you see,
That you're hurting me,
Build me up and let me down down.
Oh, ain't never felt this way before,
Don't walk out the door,
I can't take no more.




Baby, can't you see,
You're killing me,
You just don't know,
I like your flow,
Come dig me though,
I can't take no more,
Really though, really though, really though.
