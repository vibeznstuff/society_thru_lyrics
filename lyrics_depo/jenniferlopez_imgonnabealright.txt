It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside I could hear voices telling me this ain't right
Don't you know it's not for you
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
Because I love you
I just tried to stay

I used to say I couldn't do it
But I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes
I can feel it
And I know inside I'm gonna be alright
I said I couldn't do it
But I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes
I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

Friends of mine say to me
They say you got control over me
You're not alone
I played a part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you

I used to say I couldn't do it
But I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes
I can feel it
And I know inside I'm gonna be alright
I said I couldn't do it
But I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes
I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

Said I wouldn't walk away
Somedays I want to stay
But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay
Never thought it would be true
Me livin' without you
But now it's time for me to make a move

I used to say I couldn't do it
But I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes
I can feel it
And I know inside I'm gonna be alright
I said I couldn't do it
But I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes
I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright
