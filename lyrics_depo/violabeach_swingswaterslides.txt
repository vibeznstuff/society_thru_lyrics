Feeling a lighter breeze
The sun it shines on all you see
Squint trying to look at me
But can I use your lighter please?
You're not with me tonight
And only you could make it right

You know that we could be
You know that we could be
Eyes wide, bright light
Time flies, feels right
You know that it'll be nice
You know that we could be
Night time, sky high
Eyes like we've cried
But we've not, and all I wanna know is

Won't you come home?
Won't you come home?
Won't you come home?
Won't you come home?
Won't you come home?
Won't you come home?
Won't you come home?
Won't you come home?
Cause I need you home
Yeah I need you, oh, you know I do

It's summer all the time
With you, you make me feel alright
All swings and waterslides
We're summery and pretty high
I like to watch the tide
Come and then go out at night
With you

You know that we could be
You know that we could be
Eyes wide, bright light
Time flies, feels right
You know that it'll be nice
You know that we could be
Night time, sky high
Eyes like we've cried
But we've not, and all I wanna know is

Won't you come home?
Won't you come home?
Won't you come home?
Won't you come home?
Won't you come home?
Won't you come home?
Won't you come home?
Won't you come home?
Cause I need you home
Yeah I need you, oh, you know I do
