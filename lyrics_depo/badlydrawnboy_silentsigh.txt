Come see what we all talk about
People moving to the moon
Stop baby don't go stop here
Never stop living here
Till it eats the heart from your soul
Keeps down the sound of your
Silent sigh (repeats)
Keeps down all move me down
Could we love each other

Ooh yeah
Come see what we all talk about
People moving to the moon
Stop baby don't go stop here
Never stop living here
Till it eats the heart from your soul
Keeps down the sound of your
Silent sigh 
Keeps down all move me down
But don't love each other
Stop, no don't love each other



Silent sigh, silent silent sigh
