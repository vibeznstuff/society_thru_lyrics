I was on a heavy tip
Tryna cross a canyon with a broken limb
You were on the other side
Like always, wondering what to do with life
I'd already had a sip
So I'd reasoned I was drunk enough to deal with it
You were on the other side
Like always, you could never make your mind

And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion
That lasted for twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?

To let me dangle at a cruel angle
Oh my feet don't touch the floor
Sometimes you're half in and then you're half out
But you never close the door

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

You're a holy fool all colored blue
Red feet upon the floor
You do such damage, how do you manage
Tryna crawling back for more?

And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion
That lasted for twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

But I can't beat you
Cause I'm still with you
Oh mercy I implore
How do you do it?
I think I'm through it
Then I'm back against the wall

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
