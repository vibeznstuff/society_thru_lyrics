Don't put your head on my shoulder
Sink me in a river of tears
This could be the best place yet
But you must overcome your fears
In time we could've been so much more
But time is precious I know
In time we could've been so much more
The time has nothing to show
because
Time won't give me time
And time makes lovers feel
Like they've got something real
But you and me we know
We got nothing
but time
And time won't give me time
Won't give me time
Don't make me feel any colder
Time is like a clock in my heart
Touch we touch was the heat too much
I felt I lost you from the start
In time we could've been so much more
But time is precious I know
In time we could've been so much more
The time has nothing to show because
Time won't give me time
And time makes lovers feel
Like they've got something real
But you and me we know
We've got nothing but time
And time won't give me time
Won't give me time
