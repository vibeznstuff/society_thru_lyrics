Standing at the bar tryin' to get a drink
Got one I hadn't touched at the table
Somebody said you're here, but I ain't gonna leave
Maybe I'll just act like you're a stranger

Do you know how hard it is tryin' to hold a conversation?
Knowin' you're right there across the room
So I don't hear a word that they're sayin'
No, I don't hear a word that they're sayin'


You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?
You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?
Who's gonna walk up and say "hi"
Then lean in a little close to whose lips
Say, "What the hell are we doin'?"
You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?


I'm dancing with a girl, got my eyes closed
Actin' like I'm lost in the music
All I'm thinkin' 'bout is holdin' you close
I don't know how much longer I can do this


Do you know how hard it is bein' in this situation?
Knowing you were everything
And now havin' to act like we're nothing
And pretendin' that I don't still love you

You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?
You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?
Who's gonna walk up and say "hi"
Then lean in a little close to whose lips
Say, "What the hell are we doin'?"
You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?

Who's gonna say, "What were we thinkin'?"
Who's gonna cut like we're detention
Who's gonna admit that they miss who worse?
Who's gonna tell who how bad it hurts?

You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?
You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?
Who's gonna walk up and say "hi"
Then lean in a little too close to whose lips
Say, "What the hell are we doin'?"
You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?

You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?
Who's gonna break?
You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?
You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?
