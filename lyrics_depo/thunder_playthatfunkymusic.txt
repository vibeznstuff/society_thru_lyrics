Hey, do it now, yeah hey

Yeah, once I was a boogie singer, playin' in a rock &amp; roll band
I never had no problems, yeah, burnin' down the one night stands
And everything around me, yeah, got to start to feelin' so low
And I decided quickly (yes, I did), to disco down and check out the show

Yeah, they were dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me, somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down that boogie and play that funky music 'til you die…
'Til you die

At first, it wasn't easy, changin' rock &amp; roll and minds
And things were getting shaky, I thought I'd have to leave it behind
Oh, but now it's so much better (It's so much better), I'm funkin out in ev-er-y way
But I'll never lose that feelin' (No I won't), of how I learned my lesson that day

When they were dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me, somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down that boogie and play that funky music 'til you die…
'Til you die, oh, 'til you die

They shouted (Play that funky music)
Play that funky music
(Play that funky music) Hmm got to keep on playing funky music
(Play that funky music) Play that funky music
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die
'Til you die, Lord, 'til you die

They shouted (Play that funky music)
Play that funky music
(Play that funky music) Hmm got to keep on playing funky music
(Play that funky music) Play that funky music
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die
'Til you die, Lord, 'til you die
