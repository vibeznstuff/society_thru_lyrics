Ooh

Hey, kid, rock 'n' roll, rock on
Ooh, my soul
Hey kid, boogie, too, did ya?
Hey, shout, summertime blues
Jump up and down in my blue suede shoes
Hey, kid, rock 'n' roll, rock on

And where do we go from here?
Which is a way that's clear?
Still looking for that blue jean baby queen
Prettiest girl I've ever seen
See her shake on the movie screen, Jimmy Dean
(James Dean)
