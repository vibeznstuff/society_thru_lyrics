When your time runs out
And you're looking for a place to land
I'll step from the shadow
Into the palm of your hand

When you're out of luck
I'll be what you're looking for
Even if it's not who I am

When you're out of luck
I'll be what you're looking for
Even if it's not who I am

I can change
I can change for you
I can change
I can change for you

I can bend
I can break
I can shift
I can shape
Blaze a trail through the driving rain
Girl, I can change for you
I can change for you

When your time runs out
And you don't know where to stand
I'll step from the shadow
I'm at your command

 And when you're looking for a change...

...I'll be what you're looking for
Even if it's not who I am

I can change
I can change for you
I can change
I can change for you

I can bend
I can break
I can shift
I can shape
Blaze a trail through the driving rain
Girl, I can change for you

I can slip
I can slide
I can run
I can hide
Blaze a trail through the driving rain
Girl, I can change for you

I'll be what you're looking for
I'll be what you're looking for

I can change
I can change for you
I'll be what you're looking for
I can change
I can change for you

I can change
I can change

I can bend
I can break
I can shift
I can shape
Blaze a trail through the driving rain

I can slip
I can slide
I can run
I can hide
Blaze a trail through the driving rain
Girl, I can change for you
I can change for you
I can change

I'll be what you're looking for
