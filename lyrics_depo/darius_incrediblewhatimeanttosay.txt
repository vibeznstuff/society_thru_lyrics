You said its over 
I said "that's ok 
I wasn't in to you anyway" 
I told you "lately 
you irritate me your laugh is too loud 
you're the last girl I'd look at 
if you were in a crowd" 

Could you tell? 
I was lying and hiding the truth away 
and what I really wanted to say 


is you are incredible you are amazing 
you blow my mind one of a kind 
I'm having a meltdown 
you are incredible you are amazing 
but sometimes telling the truth 
is easier said than done, 
"don't leave baby" - 
now that's what I meant to say 

"My worlds not ending I'll be just fine" 
That's what my mouth said 
but not what I felt inside 
I told you "baby, 
your not the answer to all of my prayers 
cos I like my girlfriends in short skirts with longer hair" 

could you tell? 
I was lying and hiding the truth away 
and what I really wanted to say 



Well I said I didn't care about what you felt about me 
couldn't care less about what I said or done 
I didn't mean it - its not what I meant to say 
you know the truth is that I care 
about what you think about me 
maybe too much, I've been puttin' on a front 
I didn't mean it - and what I meant to say 

is you are incredible you are amazing 
you blow my mind one of a kind 
I'm having a meltdown 
you are incredible you are amazing 
but sometimes telling the truth 
is easier said than done, yeah yeah 
telling the truth is easier said than done. 
Can't you see 
telling the truth is easier said than done. 
"Don't leave baby" now that's what I meant to say
