You're the boy who murdered love

You're the boy who murdered love
Cold hands and a heart of stone
You're a midas in reverse
You're the king of pain and hurt
And the stars turn into fire
And the roses change from red to black
You encourage my desire, then you put the arrow in my back, and I'm


Shot, shot, shot, shot, shot like a bullet
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop oh you love it
No, no, no, no, no now you've done it oh
You're the boy who murdered love, love, love, love, love, love
You're the boy who murdered love

You're the thief of innocence
You're a tainted cherry tree
There's a mark upon your skin
Where your heart once used to be
You're a sinner with no soul
You're the nearly was I never had
You're an angel I was told, then you put the arrow in my back, and I'm


Shot, shot, shot, shot, shot like a bullet
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop oh you love it
No, no, no, no, no now you've done it oh
You're the boy who murdered love, love, love, love, love, love
You're the boy who murdered love, love, love, love, love, love
You're the boy who murdered love

Oh ah ah oh, oh ohh ohh
Oh oh oh ah ah oh


Shot, shot, shot, shot, shot like a bullet
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop oh you love it
No, no, no, no, no now you've done it oh
You're the boy who murdered love, love, love, love, love, love
You're the boy who murdered love, love, love, love, love, love
You're the boy who murdered love, love, love, love, love, love
You're the boy who murdered love
