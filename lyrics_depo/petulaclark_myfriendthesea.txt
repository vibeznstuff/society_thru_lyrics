Oh you great ocean so deep, Oh you ocean so wide
I feel you are my friend so in you I confide
You know the world, every land, every shore
There's not a place you don't explore

Send every wave as it rolls on it's way
Searchin' high, searchin' low, searchin' each little bay
Send out a plea to the whole of seven seas
Where is the one I adore?

My friend the sea, be true to me
My love, one day sailed far away
My friend the sea, please ask the tide
To bring my love home to my side

Oh you great ocean so deep, Oh you ocean so wide
There are hearts you unite, There are hearts you divide
You know the world; Every river, mountain, stream
Look everywhere you've ever been

Ask all the fish as they swim out to sea
Would they pass on the word as a favor to me
Maybe they'll look out some little brook
And find the one I adore

My friend the sea, be true to me
My love, one day sailed far away
My friend the sea, please ask the tide
To bring my love home to my side
