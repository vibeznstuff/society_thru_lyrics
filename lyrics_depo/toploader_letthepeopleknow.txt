Running high, 
Leave behind the shadows in your mind 
Into the beginning of your life 
Society breeds hatred in your heart, but baby 
It's time to make a brand new start 
Life's everchanging in your eyes 
But the time for rearranging will arise 

Through the rain and snow 
Let the people know, let the people know the way 
And when it's time to go let the people show, 
Let the people show the way 

Living high, 
Pushing back the boundaries with a smile 
Effortless but only for a while, 
A deity comes to you in the night 
Lightens up your day without a fight 
And life's still everchanging in your eyes 
But the time for rearranging will arise 

Through the rain and snow 
Let the people know, let the people know the way 
And when it's time to go let the people show, 
Let the people show the way 

If the people want to know - show them the way 
If the people got to know - show them the way 

Living high, 
You left behind the shadows in your mind, 
The sun came out and put them out of time 
The rhythm you can feel's in time with mine 
So come on baby let's go for a ride 
And life still keeps on changing in your eyes 
But changes come and go - and so do I 

Through the rain and snow 
Let the people know, let the people know the way 
And when it's time to go let the people show, 
Let the people show the way
