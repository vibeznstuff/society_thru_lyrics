Mother doesn't know where love has gone
She says it must be youth that keeps us feeling strong
I see it in her face that's turned to ice
And when she smiles she shows the lines of sacrifice

And now I know what they're saying
As our sun begins to fade
And we made our love on wasteland
And through the barricades

Father made my history
He fought for what he thought would set us somehow free
He taught me what to say in school
I learned it off by heart but now that's torn in two

And now I know what they're saying
In the music of the parade
And we made our love on wasteland
And through the barricades

Born on different sides of life
But we feel the same and feel all of this strife
So come to me when I'm asleep
And we'll cross the line and dance upon the streets

And now I know what they're saying
As the drums begin to fade
And we made our love on wasteland
And through the barricades

Oh, turn around and I'll be there
Well there's a scar right through my heart but I'll bare it again
Oh, I thought we were the human race
But we were just another borderline case
And the stars reach down and tell us
That there's always one escape

Oh, I don't know where love has gone
And in this troubled land desperation keeps us strong
Friday's child is full of soul
With nothing left to lose, there's everything to go

And now I know what they're saying
It's a terrible beauty we've made
So we make our love on wasteland
And through the barricades

And now I know what they're saying
As our hearts go to their graves
And we made our love on wasteland
And through the barricades
