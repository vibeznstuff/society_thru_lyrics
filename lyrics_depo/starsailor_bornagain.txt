But for the grace of God, she cries herself to sleep
Because the grace of God is something she can't keep.
Oh, it won't be long
Before their hold is broken
No, it won't be long
Until we find our home.

It's for the good of you I write sweet melodies
They'll cast the first stone when the last one's out of reach
Oh, it won't be long
Before their hold is broken
No, it won't be long
Until we've found our home.

Forget where to begin
Mother, I have not sinned
I have not sinned

But for the grace of God, she cries herself to sleep
But now the grace of God's the reason why she weeps
Oh, it won't be long
Before their hold is broken
No, it won't be long
Until we find our home.

When summer comes
Light my life
Snow will melt away


I was born again, I was born again
Not into the world they put me in
She was born again, she was born again
Not into the world they put her in


The hope and the spirit
I'd rather not feel it
The hope and the spirit
I'd rather not fear it
