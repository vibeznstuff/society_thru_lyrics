Come inside boy - they call this fun! 
(Music to please the adolescent) 
Taking the easy way out again 
Part of the process - same old story 
Follow the leaders 
(look at the leaders) 

You just condone all that you mean 
Play time doesn't last forever 
Shouting about it taking the bait 
Walking again in the same direction 
Follow the leaders 
(look at the leaders) 

Time moves on and then you notice 
The ground starts to tremble beneath your feet 
Man killed man and blood was shed (yawn!) 
And the gasps of relief at human nature like 
Follow the leaders
