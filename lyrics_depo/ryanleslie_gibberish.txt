Time is runnin' out 
Please don't make me wait 
I'm all alone 
I'll stab a day 
Lost and love a ghost 
Lost all alone 
It's another lost one 
You stay gone 
Pissed on a wall 
Hit it in the face 
I don't wanna go 
I'll stab a day 
Lost and love a ghost 
I'll stab a lay  
Let's boogaloo la  
It's all day

Lovely date 
And I'll date you 
I'll take you on a day date 
And it's a lovely day

I see your body lighting up in the moonlight 
As a ghost story you jump in the moonlight 
I wanna feel you in the dark when I do right 
Do right right there, yeah 
As a ghost story you jump in the morning, 
I signal, I want that by all means 
I signal you, and you got where I want that 
Want that right there, right there
