Show me your company, come and tell me who you'll be
I'll try and take things easy, I'll be loose, I'll be carefree
I'm living for tomorrow not today, gotta make my plans so in case
I'll be prepared when I see you smiling

'Cause I feel so high away, I'm reaching out for your sky
I've boundless energies, I feel I could run a million miles
I'm riding on the wheel of fortune, taking me to places far and free
I feel so high when I approach your sky

When I touch your sky, I, I want my joy to be discreet
Can't seem to hide the feeling that you knock me from my seat
When I'm talking with my friends, you're the subject every time
I know I bore them but they do it to me sometimes

'Cause I feel so high away, I'm reaching out for your sky
I've boundless energies, I feel I could run a million miles
I'm riding on the wheel of fortune, taking me to places far and free
I feel so high when I approach your sky

I've seen you exposed, your thoughts are nude
Come on, take off your pride baby, you should wash your attittude
I'm sitting here watching you baby, trying to pretend you're cool and calm
Come on now, you can tell me baby, did the gypsy read your palm?

Show me your company, come and tell me who you'll be
I'll try and take things easy, I'll be loose, I'll be carefree
I'm living for tomorrow not today, gotta make my plans so in case
I'll be prepared when I see you smiling

'Cause I feel so high away, I'm reaching out for your sky
I've boundless energies, I feel I could run a million miles
I'm riding on the wheel of fortune, taking me to places far and free
I feel so high when I approach your sky

I feel so high, when I'm touching your sky baby
I feel so high
I feel so high, when I'm touching your sky baby
I feel so high yeah, yeah
I feel so high, when I'm touching your sky baby
I feel so high
I feel so high, when I'm touching your sky baby
I feel so high yeah, yeah
