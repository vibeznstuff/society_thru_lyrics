Now I don't have to question
Where you were last night
Cause I already know what you will say
I already know you'll lie
But I can't be mad at ya
For there's something that you don't know
When you're gone I do my own thing
And I catch a bone while you're doggin' me


When you're out in the club
Don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love
Don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good
In somebody's spot
Getting hot
Don't stop
Just don't think I'm not
'Cause I'm out getting mine




When I tried to get your attention
You ignored me every time
You were so caught up doin' your dirt that
You didn't notice mine
Couldn't put up with your schemin'
I couldn't put up with your lies
They say two wrongs don't make a right but
It's suiting me just fine


Don't look so surprised to know that
Sometimes women play the field
You may not believe it, but it's real...
The game is so real
