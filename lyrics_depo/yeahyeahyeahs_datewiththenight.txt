I got a date with the night
putting out my finger 
gonna catch the kids dry
gonna walk on water
buying out the fight 
we're sweating in the winter 
both thighs squeeze tight
choke choke choke choke choke choke choke choke choke choke
don't tell me to fix her 
don't tell me to fix her 
just take a bite 
no hanging no picture 
blind out my sight 
dropping brides at the altar 
both thighs squeeze tight
choke choke choke choke choke choke choke choke choke choke

I'll send it to you
I'll set it off
I'll send it to you
I'll set it off
I'll send it to you
I'll set it off
I'll send it to you
I'll set it off, uh huh!

I'll send it to you
I'll set it off
I'll send it to you
I'll set it off
I'll send it to you
I'll set it off
I'll send it to you
I'll set it off, uh uh!

Buying out the fight
gonna walk on water 
gonna catch the kids dry
gonna bend my finger
blind out my sight
we're sweating in the winter 
both thighs squeeze tight
both thighs squeeze tight
