Oh, hold on 
You risk exciting me 
Once in Germany someone said nein 
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9 

Oh, hold back 
Oh, don't invite me 
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9 
Once in Germany someone said nein 

I'm a wheel 
I will 
Turn on you 

Oh, I invented a sister 
Populated with knives 
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh 
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh 
I'm a wheel 
I will 
Turn on you 

Um... 

I'm a wheel 
I will 

I'm a wheel 
I will 

I'm a wheel 
I will 
Turn on you 

I'm gonna turn on you, turn on you 
Turn on you, turn on you, turn on you 

I'm gonna turn on you, turn on you 
Turn on you, turn on you, turn on you 

I'm gonna turn on you, turn on you, turn on you
