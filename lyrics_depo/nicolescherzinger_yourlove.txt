Boy you don't know how much I like it
It's so hard, not to bite it
Just a little, know you like it
I'll do whatever you want

Something 'bout you so enticing
Even when I try to fight it
Knock me out like Michael Tyson
I'll do whatever you want

And I, I'm never letting you go baby
I love you so baby
Love me the most baby
Ain't going nowhere like froze baby
Do whatever you want, baby
And everything you don't baby
Be whatever you need

Cause your love makes me feel like

Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do
Boy your love makes me feel like
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do
Boy your touch makes me feel like
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do
Boy your love makes me feel like
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do
Cause your love makes me feel like

Yeah baby you got me
Yeah my body's like Bugatti
You know everybody wants one
You got everything they don't
You get all my love and all my kisses when we huggin'
MC Hammer girls can't touch this
I got everything they don't

And I, I'm never letting you go baby
I love you so baby
Love me the most baby
Ain't going nowhere like froze baby
Do whatever you want, baby
And everything you don't baby
Be whatever you need

Cause your love makes me feel like

Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do

I need you in the daytime
Especially in the night time
I'm never in my right mind
When I'm with you baby, oh
I need your body on me
Whenever you're gone I get lonely
Can't believe how much I'm missing you

Your love makes me feel like
Your love makes me feel like
Your love makes me feel like (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Your love makes me feel like
Your love makes me feel like

Cause your love makes me feel like
