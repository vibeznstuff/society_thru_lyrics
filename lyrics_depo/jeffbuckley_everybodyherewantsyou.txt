Twenty-nine pearls in your kiss 
A singing smile 
Coffee smell and lilac skin 
Your flame in me 

Twenty-nine pearls in your kiss 
A singing smile 
Coffee smell and lilac skin 
Your flame in me 

I'm only here for this moment 

I know everybody here wants you 
I know everybody here thinks he needs you 
I'll be waiting right here just to show you 
How our love will blow it all away 

Hmm, such a thing of wonder in this crowd
I'm a stranger in this town 
You're free with me 
And our eyes locked in downcast love 
I sit here proud 
Even now you're undressed in your dreams with me 

Oh, I'm only here for this moment 

I know everybody here wants you 
I know everybody here thinks he needs you 
I'll be waiting right here just to show you 
How our love will blow it all away 

I know the tears we cried 
Have dried on yesterday 
The sea of fools has parted for us 
There's nothing in our way 
My love 

Don't you see, don't you see? 
You're just the torch to put the flame to all our guilt and shame 
And I'll rise like an ember in your name 

I know I, I know I 
I know everybody here wants you 
I know everybody here thinks he needs you 
I'll be waiting right here just to show you 
Oh let me show you 
That love can rise, rise just like embers 

Love can taste like the wine of the ages, oh babe, 
And I know they all looks so good from a distance 
But I tell you I'm the one 

I know everybody here, well, thinks he needs you
Think he needs you 
And I'll be waiting right here just to show you.
