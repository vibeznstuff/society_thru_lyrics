see you around as a friend
eight days the same you'd bore me just leave it
we prefer lies after rain
she said leave it i can't leave it 


say what you wanted to ask me
while you were sitting down
say what you wanted to ask me
so you open up now

fake plastic smiles to play games
please call my name ignore me and feel it
i thought that i had won gold
she said leave it i can't leave this



take it or leave it
