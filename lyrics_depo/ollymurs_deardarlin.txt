Dear darlin’, please excuse my writing.
I can’t stop my hands from shaking
'Cause I’m cold and alone tonight.

I miss you and nothing hurts like no you.
And no one understands what we went through.
It was short. It was sweet. We tried.

And if my words break through the wall
And meet you at your door,
All I can say is “Girl, I mean them all.”

 I understand where he's coming from.

Been thinking about the bar we drank in.
Feeling like the sofa was sinking.
I was warm in the hold of your eyes.

So if my words break through the wall
To meet you at your door,
All I can say is “Girl, I mean them all.”

Oh I can't cope. These arms are yours to hold.
