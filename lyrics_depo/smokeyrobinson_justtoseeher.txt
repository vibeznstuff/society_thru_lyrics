Just to see her, just to touch her
Just to hold her in my arms again one more time
If I could feel her warm embrace see her smiling face
Can't find anyone to take her place I've got to see her again

I would do anything, I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do just to see her again

I can't hide it, I can't fight it
It's so hard to live without the love she gave to me
Doesn't she know it, I tried hard not to show it
Can't I make her realize that she really needs me again

I would do anything, I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do just to see her again
She brightened up my everyday made me feel so good in every way
If I could have her back to stay, I've got to see her again
