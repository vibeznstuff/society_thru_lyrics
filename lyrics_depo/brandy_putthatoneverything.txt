If you're looking to find 
A love that will stand till the end of time 
Baby relax your mind my love is here 
I'll do anything I swear 
I'd take the pain and the hurt 
You won't know it's there 
Your wants would be nothing 
I put that on everything 

I will pull a star out of the sky for you 
Yes I would 
To the edge of the earth 
I'll go to see you 
Yes it's true 
If you go anywhere 
And I'm not there 
Just think on thoughts of love 
And I'll appear 

Before I dream 
I lay and think of you every night 
Honest to god 
I'm telling you the truth 
I wish you could see 
How much your presence means to me 
You would love me so much 
More each day 

I'll walk for you 
Through the desert heat 
I'll climb the mountains highest peak 
I'll swim forever in the deepest sea 
Just for you this song I sing 
For all the love and joy you bring 
For you I'll try 
To do the impossible things
