I remember all the early days
Trying to think of the right things to say
I didn't want you to think I was like the rest
Who think they own you just because you've laid with them
It didn't matter - really didn't matter
It didn't matter now we are together

There are crystal hearts just waiting to be smashed
And out to break them are the ones who never last
To soon today and gone tomorrow
And taking with them just another little piece of you

There are those who think its smart
Thinking that they've stole your love and broke your heart
Too much too soon and gone tomorrow
Well my love doesn't need to lend or steal or borrow
