Dreaming of the queen
Visiting for tea
You and her and I
And lady Di

The queen said: "I'm aghast"
Love never seem to last
However hard you try
And Di replied

That there are no more lovers left alive
No one has survived
So there are no more lovers left alive
And that's why my love has died

Yes, it's true
Look, it's happened
To me and you

The carriages arrived
We stood and said goodbye
Diana dried her eyes
And looked surprised

For I was in the nude
The old queen disapproved
But people laughed and asked
For autographs

That there are no more lovers left alive
No one has survived
So there are no more lovers left alive
And that's why my love has died

Yes, it's true
Look, it's happened
To me and you

I woke up in a sweat
Desolate

That there are no more lovers left alive
No one has survived
So there are no more lovers left alive
And that's why my love has died

Yes, it's true
Look, it's happened
To me and you
