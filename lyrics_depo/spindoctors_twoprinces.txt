One, two princes kneel before you 
That what I said now 
Princes, princes who adore you 
Just go ahead now 
One has diamonds in his pockets 
That's some bread, now 
This one said he wants to buy you rockets 
Ain't in his head, now 

This one he got a princely racket 
That's what I said now 
Got some Big Seal upon his jacket 
Ain't in his head now 
You marry him, your father will condone you 
How 'bout that now 
You marry me, your father will disown you 
He'll eat his hat, now 

Marry him, marry me 
I'm the one that loved you baby can't you see? 
Ain't got no future or family tree 
But I know what a prince and lover ought to be 
I know what a prince and lover ought be 

Said if you want to call me baby 
Just go ahead now 
And if you like to tell me maybe 
Just go ahead now 
And if you wanted to buy me flowers 
Just go ahead now 
And if you like to talk for hours 
Just go ahead now
