I thought you were just bein' a girl
The kind that just wants to change me
And likes to fight all night long
Thought I had you figured out
I told myself she's crazy
Man, was I ever wrong
The whole time you were just tryin' to love me

I pushed, you pulled, should've just fell into you
But I did what I always do, I always do
You wanted to talk but I walked away
Didn't want to hear what you had to say
Stupid me I can't believe I never knew
The whole time you were just tryin' to love me

I didn't think those tears were real
I thought you were just tryin' to play me
I just stood there and let 'em fall, ohh
You were just lovin' me after all, ohhh

I pushed, you pulled, should've just fell into you
But I did what I always do, I always do
You wanted to talk but I walked away
Didn't want to hear what you had to say
Stupid me I can't believe I never knew
The whole time you were just tryin' to love me

You wanted to talk but I walked away
Didn't want to hear what you had to say
Stupid me I can't believe I never knew, I never knew
The whole time you were just tryin'
The whole time you were just tryin' to love me
Tryin' to love me
