About as subtle as an earthquake, I know,
My mistakes were made for you.
And in the backroom of the bad dream, she came,
And whisked me away, enthused.

And it's as solid as a rock rolling down a hill,
The fact is that it probably will hit something,
On the hazardous terrain.

And we're just following the flock,
Around and in-between,
Before we're smashed to smithereens
Like they were, then we scramble from the blame
And it's the fame that put words in her mouth,
She couldn't help, but spit them out.
Innocence and arrogance entwined,
In the filthiest of minds.

She was bitten on her birthday,
And now a face in the crowd, she's not.
And I suspected now forever the shape
She came to escape, is forgot.

And it's a lot to ask her not to sting.
And give her less than everything;
Around your crooked conscious she will wind.

And we're just following the flock,
Around and in-between,
Before we're smashed to smithereens
Like they were, and we scrambled from the blame.
And it's the fame that put words in her mouth,
She couldn't help but spit them out
Around your crooked conscious she will wind.

And it's a lot to ask her not to sting,
And give her less than everything
Innocence and arrogance entwined.
