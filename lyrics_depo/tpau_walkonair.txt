It was an ordinary day
Not very special anyway
Who could have thought so much could change
Sometimes it's outside of our hand
You never dreamed it could be you
To safe to ever feel so blue
No warning signal to beware
Or faint suspicion of the fear

No rhyme or reason
More like a snap of someone's fingers
Like you were in somebody's game
Then thrown away

We walk on air, we take our share
Of what we want, but when it's gone
We stumble on
And walk into that wilderness
Nothing to show, no matter how
We steel our selves to live alone
It hurts you so
To walk into that wilderness

Before your eyes could face the dawn
Before you knew what had begun
And still the voice inside your head
Keeps asking when he will return

No explanation
Or opportunity to question
No chance to even say good-bye
No wonder why

We walk on air, we take our share
Of what we want, but when it's gone
We stumble on
And walk into that wilderness

No rhyme or reason
Just like a snap of someone's fingers
Like you got in somebody's way
And had to pay

We walk on air, we take our share
Of what we want, but when it's gone
We stumble on
And walk into that wilderness
Nothing to show, no matter how
We steel our selves to live alone
It hurts you so
To walk into that wilderness
If we walk on air
