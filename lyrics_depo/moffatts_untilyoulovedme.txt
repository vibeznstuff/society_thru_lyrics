Monday morning came too soon 
I think about you now 
Lay'n in my room 
Hearing everything you said 
I play it back 
A hundred times in my head 
Then I slip into a dream 
The feelin' inside 
Is ten stories high

 
Never knew what love was 
Until you loved me 
Never knew what love was 
Oh yeah 
'Cause it feels so good sometimes 
And it feels so bad sometimes 
The way you loved me, loved me 
The way you loved me, loved me 
Friday's always on my mind 
I watch the rain come down 
Think of how you shine 
Let it go or hang on tight 
Stay forever 
Or stay for one more night 
Either way I feel the same thing for ya 
The feelin' inside 
Is ten stories high 

Never knew what love was 
Until you loved me 
Never knew what love was 
Oh yeah 
'Cause it feels so good sometimes 
Don't ya know it feels so bad sometimes 
The way you loved me, loved me 
Oh yeah 
You know that I want you 
You know that I need you
