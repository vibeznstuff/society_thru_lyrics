I can honestly understand why it's over
I can go through the motions of walking away
I can give you the key and take my things back
I can find plenty things to fill my days

But I don't know how not to think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who is strong and just moves on
But I probably turn down your road, knock knock on your door
Fall back in your arms, wake up in the morning
Hating myself for the way that I can't help the way I still want you

I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to 

You're like second nature baby, you're just like breathin'
A melody that you hear and you can't forget
The time goes by and I still need you
Yeah, you were at the heartbreak of no regret

But I don't know how not to think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who is strong and just moves on
But I probably turn down your road, knock knock on your door
Fall back in your arms, wake up in the morning
Hating myself for the way that I can't help the way I still want you

I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to 

I don't know how not to think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
But I know that I ought to be the one who's strong and just moves on
But I probably turn down your road, knock knock on your door
Fall back in your arms, wake up in the morning
Hating myself for the way that I can't help the way I still want you

I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to
