I met a roach in America
his family had a massive tree

they live just about everywhere -
he was big in America
he was big in America.

I met a vet in America
he was alive
he was in overdrive

he'd just been around everywhere -
he was big in America
he was big in America.

And when you're big in America you like to live in America -
you won't be on your own -
and since you're big in America
you might as well make America your home.
Big in America!

I met a girl in America
she wore the pants
cross the big expanse

she was whipping men everywhere -
she was big in America
she was big in America.

And when you're big in America you like to live in America -
big in America!
Big in America!
Big in America!
