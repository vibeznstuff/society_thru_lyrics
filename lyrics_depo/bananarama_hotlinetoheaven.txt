With your smile you're making plans 
You've got the world right in the palm of your hands 
Everything you touch is gold 
But your future life is bought and sold 
It seems to me that you've got it made 
But you never show that you're afraid 
Now the voices in your head 
They make you scream and drive you mad 

You're on a hotline to heaven 
Now you're all alone 
Riding on a hotline to heaven 
Standing on your own 

Staring eyes as cold as stone 
A wandering figure that stands alone 
Reaching out you cry for help 
Once a man but now you're just a shell 
You make a deal, you make a grade 
But you're heading for an early grave 
You got to find it, got to try 
Something special to get you high 

You're on a hotline to heaven 
Now you're all alone 
Riding on a hotline to heaven 
Standing on your own 

You're on a hotline to heaven 
(Going up without me baby, I won't let you drive me crazy) 
Now you're all alone 
Riding on a hotline to heaven 
(Going up without me baby, I won't let you drive me crazy) 
Standing on your own 

It seems to me that you've got it made 
But you're heading for an early grave 
A thousand voices in your head 
Make you scream and drive you mad 

You're on a hotline to heaven 
Now you're all alone 
Riding on a hotline to heaven 
Standing on your own 

You're on a hotline to heaven 
(Going up without me baby, I won't let you drive me crazy) 
Now you're all alone 
Riding on a hotline to heaven 
(Going up without me baby, I won't let you drive me crazy) 
Standing on your own
