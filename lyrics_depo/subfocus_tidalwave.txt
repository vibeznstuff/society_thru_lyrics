You can't just give it away
Like it means nothing
Love isn't this game where
You win something

I'm tired of being 
On the outside 
I wanna know 
What it's like 
I'm tired of seeing 
All the sights
I wanna feel
Us collide

Your love washes over 
Like a tidal wave
I feel the impact
As we collide 
Your love washes over 
Like a tidal wave
I feel the impact
As we collide 

All the games we play
You're fooling nobody 
If it makes you feel good
When you're hurting somebody 

I'm tired of being 
On the outside
I wanna know 
What it's like
I'm tired of seeing 
All the sights
I wanna feel 
Us collide

Your love washes over
Like a tidal wave
I feel the impact
As we collide
Your love washes over
Like a tidal wave
I feel the impact
As we collide

I feel the impact
As we collide
