The sun still hangin' in the sky
And the world is wide awake outside
And I know there's things we need to do
But I just wanna draw the blinds and...

Say goodnight
Oh won't you let me pull you into me
Go wherever all these kisses lead
Turn down the bed
Turn out the lights
And say goodnight

What's the point of trying to pretend
That we don't wanna just give in
Why are we holdin' onto this day
Let's just let it fade away and...

Say goodnight
Oh won't you let me pull you into me
Go wherever all these kisses lead
Turn down the bed
Turn out the lights
And say goodnight

Baby I don't want to wait
I just wanna hear you say
Goodnight
Oh won't you let me pull you into me
Go wherever all these kisses lead
Turn down the bed
Turn out the lights
And say goodnight
Say goodnight
