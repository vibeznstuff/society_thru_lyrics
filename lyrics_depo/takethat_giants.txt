We're all giants, I can't believe it
We were giants all along
On the surface and all around us
We are giants, we are strong
I see you standing, see you dancing
On the pavement, in the park
We are giants, can you feel it?
So much bigger than we thought

I think I might be heading out of body
I've gotta love, you gotta love somebody

When I look in your eyes
I'm bigger than the night sky
As high as the sun, hard as a stone
We are giants, we are giants
We are giants

There are giants across the water
There are giants heading home
In the middle of the madness
There are giants being born

I feel us breaking out of empty glory
I've gotta love, you gotta love somebody like you

When I look in your eyes
I'm bigger than the night sky
As high as the sun, hard as a stone
We are giants, we are giants
When I look in your eyes
I'm bigger than the night sky
As high as the sun, hard as a stone
We are giants, we are giants

We are giants in our hearts
We are giants, every one of us
We are giants in our hearts
We are giants, we are giants

When I look in your eyes
I'm bigger than the night sky
As high as the sun, hard as a stone
We are giants, we are giants
We are giants
We are giants
As high as the sun, hard as a stone
We are giants, we are giants
We are giants
