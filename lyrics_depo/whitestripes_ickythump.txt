Iiiiiiiieeeeeee
Icky thump
Who'da thunk?
Sittin' drunk on a wagon to Mexico.

Ah well,
What a chump
Well my head got a bump
When I hit it on the radio.

Redhead señorita
Looking dead
Came and said
"need a bed?"
En Español.

I said
"gimme a drink a water,
I'm gonna 'sing around the collar'
And I don't need a microphone."




Icky thump
with a lump in my throat
Grabbed my coat
And I was freaking
I was ready to go!

And I swear
Besides the hair
She had one white eye,
One black(nk) stare
Lookin' up
Lyin' there.

On the stand
near her hand
Was a candy cane
Black rum, sugar cane,
Dry ice (and) something strange.

La la, la la la la la la la la la laaa laaa laaa



White Americans, what?
Nothing better to do?
Why don't you kick yourself out?
You're an immigrant too?

Who's usin' who?
What should we do?
Well you can't be a pimp
And a prostitute too

Icky thump, handcuffed to a bunk
Robbed blind
Looked around
And there was nobody else

Left alone
I hit myself with a stone
Went home
And learned how to clean up after myself
