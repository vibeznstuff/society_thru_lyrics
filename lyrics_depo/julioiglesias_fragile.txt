If blood will flow
When flesh and steel are one
Drying in the colour
Of the evening sun
Tomorrow's rain
Will wash the stains away
But something in our minds
Will always stay

Perhaps this final act was meant
To clinch a lifetime's argument
That nothing comes from violence
And nothing ever could
For all those born beneath an angry star
Lest we forget how fragile we are

On and on
The rain will fall
Like tears from a star...
Like tears from a star

On and on
The rain will say
How fragile we are...
How fragile we are

On and on
The rain will fall
Like tears from a star...
Like tears from a star

On and on
The rain will say
How fragile we are...
How fragile we are

If blood will flow
When flesh and steel are one
Drying in the colour
Of the evening sun
Tomorrow's rain
Will wash the stains away
But something in our minds
Will always stay

On and on
The rain will fall
Like tears from a star...
Like tears from a star

On and on
The rain will say
How fragile we are...
How fragile we are

On and on
The rain will fall
Like tears from a star...
Like tears from a star

On and on
The rain will say
How fragile we are...
How fragile we are
