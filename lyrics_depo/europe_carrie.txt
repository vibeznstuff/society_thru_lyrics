When lights go down, I see no reason
For you to cry. We've been through this before
In every time, in every season,
God knows I've tried
So please don't ask for more.

Can't you see it in my eyes
This might be our last goodbye

Carrie, Carrie, things they change my friend
Carrie, Carrie, maybe we'll meet again,
Somewhere again

I read your mind, with no intentions
Of being unkind, I wish I could explain
It all takes time, whole lot of patience
If it's a crime, how come I feel no pain.

Can't you see it in my eyes
This might be our last goodbye

Carrie, Carrie, oh things they change my friend
Carrie, Carrie, maybe we'll meet again

Can't you see it in my eyes
This might be our last goodbye

Carrie, Carrie, oh things they change Carrie Carrie Carrie
Carrie, Carrie, maybe we'll meet again
Oh somewhere, again

When lights go down
