What you can't see can't hurt you they say
But I've been blind too many times before
Never see it coming your way
Shadows and secrets hide
Give me the bright lights of the dance floor
To shine inside this broken heart of mine
The way you move I'm forgetting all the ghosts in my mind
Just say your mine and stay by my side
Don't say you're leaving
Don't turn out the lights
I scream I scream I scream

Don't let the the darkness come and hold me
I need someone cause I can't be lonely tonight
Come on baby come and take me in your arms
I'll never be scared of the dark
And when the shadows creep up on me
If I shiver keep your body close to mine
Come on baby come and take me in your arms
I'll never be scared of the dark

I'm the kind who's always falling
Into trouble and into paradise
I don't love by half I'm all in I wanna be yours
Just say you're mine and stay by my side
Don't say you're leaving
Don't turn out the lights
I scream I scream I scream

Don't let the the darkness come and hold me
I need someone cause I can't be lonely tonight
Come on baby come and take me in your arms
I'll never be scared of the dark
And when the shadows creep up on me
If I shiver keep your body close to mine
Come on baby come and take me in your arms
I'll never be scared of the dark
Never be scared of the dark
Never be scared of the dark
Come on baby come and take me in your arms
I'll never be scared of the dark

In your arms 
I'll never be scared of the dark

Don't let the the darkness come and hold me
I need someone cause I can't be lonely tonight
Come on baby come and take me in your arms
I'll never be scared of the dark
And when the shadows creep up on me
If I shiver keep your body close to mine
Come on baby come and take me in your arms
I'll never be scared of the dark
