I come from Bed-Stuy, niggas either do or they gon' die
Gotta keep the ratchet close by
Someone murdered, nobody seen, nobody heard it
Just another funeral service
Niggas will get at you, come through shinin' they yap you
In broad day light kidnap you
Feds get clapped too, police stay on us like tattoos
Niggas only grind cause we have to
Money is power, sling crack, weed and powder
Fiends come through every hour
S'all about that dollar and we nuh deal with cowards
Weak lambs get devoured by the lion
In the concrete jungle, the strong stand and rumble
The weak fold and crumble, it's the land of trouble
Brooklyn, home of the greatest rappers
BIG comes first, then the Queen comes after


Now put ya lighters up
Bed Stuy put ya lighters up
New York put ya lighters up
DC keep puttin' ya lighters up
Philadelphia put ya lighters up
Detroit put ya lighters up
Chi-Town keep puttin' dem lighters up
No matter where you from put ya lighters up


Now lemme give you a walk through
Show ya what to do and ya don't do
Where it's not safe to go to
Dem boys approach you
Better say quick who you close to
Don't come through if niggas don't know you
Cuz people is talkin', the streets is watchin'
The thieves is lurkin' stash da nine in the garbage
The life of a hustla, the life of a gambler
Dice games kill' mo' niggas than cancer
Ya know who ya fuck with
Brooklyn don't run we run shit
Roll up and just bum rush shit
We don't play that out in B.K not at all
4 pound leave ya face on the wall
R.I.P in memory of
Never show thy enemies love
We get it on where we live
Better have a pass when you cross that bridge

Damn homie I'm so to'

And I don't think I'm ever gon' drink no mo'
But fuck it, bartender you can gimmie one mo'
(We in the club like) Damn homie I'm so to'

(Passin' the cup like) And I don't think I'm ever gon' drink no mo'
(Back at the bar like) But fuck it baretender, you can gimmie one mo'


See BIG done told you
I'm the hottest bitch on the planet
Biggest sex symbol since Janet
The Zanotti bandit
Layin' in the cut like a bandage
Come through Fulton St. in a Vanquish
Doin' dem damage
And if you don't understand it
Then lemme give it to you in Spanish
Soy la senorita mas linda del barrio
Y lo hago afuera del espacio
Still over in Brazil sippin' Mascoto
You must have forgot though
So, I'ma take it back to the block yo
Put u on to how we rock yo
Some are boostin 12 year olds prostitutin'
Hitmen hired for execution there's no solution
Niggas still piss in the hallways
Fiends get high in 'em all day
The yute, dem bang at the cops off the roof
You don't know my town is the truth
