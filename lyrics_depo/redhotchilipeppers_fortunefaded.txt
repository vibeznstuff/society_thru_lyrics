They say in chess you've got to kill the queen and then you made it.
Oh, I, do you?
A funny thing, a king that gets himself assassinated.
Hey now, every time I lose altitude.

You took a town by storm
The mess you made was nominated.
Oh, I, do you?
Now put away your welcome,
Soon you'll find you've overstayed it
Hey now, every time I lose altitude.

So divine, hell of an elevator,
All the while my fortune faded,
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded.

The medicated state of mind, you've found is overrated.
Oh, I, do you?
You saw it all come down and now it's time to imitate it.
Hey now, every time I lose altitude.

So divine, hell of an elevator,
All the while my fortune faded,
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded.

Come on, God, do I seem bulletproof?

So divine, hell of an elevator,
All the while my fortune faded,
Never mind the consequences of the crime the
This time my fortune faded.

So divine, hell of an elevator,
All the while, my fortune faded,
Never mind the consequences of the crime the
This time my fortune faded.
