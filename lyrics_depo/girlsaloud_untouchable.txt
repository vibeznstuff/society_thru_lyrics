Through wind and rain we got here
Now we're flying babe with no fear
We've been doing pain for so long
When I stare in your eyes it's all gone
Through wind and rain we burn bright
Learn to fly through flames and hold tight
With so many ways to go wrong
But when I look in your eyes they're all gone


And in my dreams it feels like we are forty stories tall
When you're around, oooh, we're untouchable
And in my dreams it feels like we aren't ever gonna fall
We're safe and sound and we're untouchable

It's only real when you're not around
I'm walking in the rain, the sun goes down (oh oh)
And only love can save us now
I need you hear again to show me how (oh oh)

I know that love shouldn't be so hard
And sometimes we're standing in the dark
But you light up everywhere I go
And I know a heart shouldn't beat so hard
And sometimes we're swimming with the sharks
But you light up and keep me out the cold



It's only real when you're not around
The candle in my head is burning out (oh oh)

I know that love shouldn't be so hard
And sometimes we're standing in the dark
But you light up everywhere I go
And I know a heart shouldn't beat so hard
And sometimes we're swimming with the sharks
But you light up and keep me out the cold



Whenever you're gone (gone) they wait at the door
And everything's hurting like before
Without any meaning, we're just skin and bone
Like beautiful robots dancing alone
Whenever you're gone (gone) they wait at the door
And everything's hurting like before
Without any meaning, we're just skin and bone
Like beautiful robots dancing alone
