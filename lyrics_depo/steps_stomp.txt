Thank God for the weekend,
Now is the time,
For feeling alright,
Come and taste the spice of life,

Tonight nothing matters,
Come and feel the groove,
Let it into you,
You know what you've gotta do,

Every Friday when my work is done now,
I get my party on,
I call a few friends of mine,
Make sure I'm looking fine,
I know we're gonna have a real good time, yeah,

Everybody clap your hands,
Get up and dance,
We're gonna stomp all night now,
Everybody move your feet,
Get up and feel the beat,
We're gonna stomp all night now,

All I need is the music,
To get me high,
Feeling so alive,
Leaving all my cares behind,
Keep doing your own thing,
And I'll keep doing mine,
Dancing through the night,
This where I feel alright,

Every Friday when my work is done now,
I get my party on,
I call a few friends of mine,
Make sure I'm looking fine,
I know we're gonna have a real good time, yeah,

Everybody clap your hands,
Get up and dance,
We're gonna stomp all night now,
Everybody move your feet,
Get up and feel the beat,
We're gonna stomp all night now,

Thank God for the weekend,
Cos now is the time,
All I need is the music,
To get me high,

Everybody, everybody,
We're gonna, we're gonna,
Stomp all night now,

Everybody clap your hands and get up and dance 
We're gonna stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp all night now!
