You lay so easy on my mind oh so easy on my mind
Whenever I need you all I have to do is close my eyes
You lay so easy on my mind oh so easy on my mind
Wrap me in your warmness and let me feel your body close to mine
Everything you say and do finds me wanting more of you
And each moment brings to life a million dreams
Heaven's something real yes it's something I can feel
When I feel your angel touch all over me
You lay so easy on my mind oh so easy on my mind
Oh there's not a thought of me your sweet love don't reach to satisfy
Every day I need you more you're the one I'm living for
And the best you'll ever give you've given me
You completely satisfy every need I have inside
And I pray you'll never take your love from me
You lay so easy on my mind oh so easy on my mind
Oh there's not a thought of me that your sweet love don't reach to satisfy
Oh there's not a thought of me that your sweet love don't reach to satisfy
