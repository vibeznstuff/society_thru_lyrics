Let's go again
This time I'm gonna make it, oh baby
Oh baby

I seemed to have woken up too early this morning
I stop and wonder, why?
Sweet visions of you, awoken me from my slumber
I ask my self is it really true? Yeah

Is this the girl I desire?
I wanna know, I gotta know
I wanna know for sure, oh girl

If your dreams are without me
Let me know, oh, oh girl
If your dreams are without me
Let me know, oh, oh girl

It's not every day I wake up, that I'm happy
It's not every day I'm sad
This vibe, this vibe, this vibe, that I'm feeling
I wanna know if you really feel it too, yeah

Sometimes when I'm lonely
This blue feeling takes a hold of me
I need your loving close to me
I need your loving desperately
So tell me, 'cause I really got to know

If your dreams are without me
Let me know, oh, oh girl
If your dreams are without me
Let me know, oh, oh girl

See sometimes when I'm lonely
This blue feeling takes a hold of me
I need your loving close to me
I need your loving desperately

So, if your dreams are without me
Let me know, oh, oh girl
If your dreams are without me
Let me know, oh, oh girl

If your dreams are without me
Really gotta know
If your dreams are without me
