Not until the next time
Will I cry all night for you
Yes, I'll stop loving you
Until the next time.

Here I am the way you left me
With a heart so full of pain
As I look into the past
I see the picture once again.

Each time I let it happen
I vow this is the end
And I stopped loving you
Until the next time.

Not until the next time
Will I cry all night for you
And listen when you beg me
For a chance when your untrue.

Not until the next time
Will my heart let me forgive
Yes, I'll stop loving you
Until the next time.

Once again I take your picture
And place it out of sight
And I put away the record
We listen to each night.

I rearrange each little thing thing
As I've done so many times
And I won't put them back
Until the next time.

Not until the next time
Will I cry all night for you
And listen when you beg me
For a chance when your untrue.

Not until the next time
Will my heart let me forgive
Yes, I'll stop loving you
Until the next time...
