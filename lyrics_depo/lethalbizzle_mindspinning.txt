Guess I got caught up in the moment
Never meant for it to go this far
Now it feels like I'm falling in deeper
I'm thinking when she's gonna show me her cards
Guess I got caught up in the moment
Never meant for it to go this far
Like the Devil in disguise she was a creeper, she had me down on my knees praying hard
And I spend all of my time thinking about you
Nowhere to turn and I can see through, my mind keeps spinning
My mind keeps spinning, my mind keeps spinning
Around, around, around, around

It's the thin line between love and hate, we started off as mates yeah everything was great
Talk on the phone for hours
She used to tell me all the guys she meets are cowards
She wants to settle down and plan baby showers 
I'm like we (we we we) no rush
I know you had bad luck but don't paint us all with that same brush
You can't predict the timing I'm maybe not the guy your looking for
But I can give you  until you find him
She said I'm so cocky, I'm too cool for school
She said she wants a Superman to catch her when she falls
I said I could be him, but maybe not now
We just basically met, chill (chill chill) for a while
I guess love's blind, love's an illusion
Love causes pain, love cause confusion
Love can make you think the wrong move's the right solution
Let's prepare for the conclusion

Guess I got caught up in the moment
Never meant for it to go this far
Now it feels like I'm falling in deeper
I'm thinking when she's gonna show me her cards
Guess I got caught up in the moment
Never meant for it to go this far
Like the Devil in disguise she was a creeper, she had me down on my knees praying hard
And I spend all of my time thinking about you
Nowhere to turn and I can see through, my mind keeps spinning
My mind keeps spinning, my mind keeps spinning
Around, around, around, around

I can feel the table turning, no pretender
For this the last, more than one night wasn't the agenda
She got me gassed up, car crash, never saw it coming
How I got here fam I don't remember
Now she don't want that shoulder that I used to lend her
Now I'm calling her phone, now it's ringing out
It's kinda funny how the situations panning out
I'm addicted to the game, I'm used to the lime light
Addicted to the pain, I know that doesn't sound right
Used to the brain, I take you on the king
Sometimes you gotta loose if you wanna win but
Love's blind, love is an illusion
Love causes pain, love cause confusion
Love will make you think the wrong move's the right solution
Let's prepare for the conclusion

Guess I got caught up in the moment
Never meant for it to go this far
Now it feels like I'm falling in deeper
I'm thinking when she's gonna show me her cards
Guess I got caught up in the moment
Never meant for it to go this far
Like the Devil in disguise she was a creeper, she had me down on my knees praying hard
And I spend all of my time thinking about you
Nowhere to turn and I can see through, my mind keeps spinning
My mind keeps spinning, my mind keeps spinning
Around, around, around, around, around
Mind keeps spinning around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around
Mind keeps spinning around, around, around, around
