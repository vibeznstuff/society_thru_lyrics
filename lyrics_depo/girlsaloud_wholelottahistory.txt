I can't talk, I've got the wrong way
Looking up what's falling down, yeah
I can't talk I've gone back the wrong way
What is the use in what I say?

I hear myself complain so I can do it again
Do it again
I give myself the blame so I get back up again
Get out of the rain

Baby, I miss you, so tell me
Is she really that beautiful? Woah
Each time she's kissed you, tell me
Is it that really that good for you?

Does she love you like I never could?
Hold you tender tell you everything's good? Woah
Would she hurt you? Cos I never could
Does she hold your body tight all night baby?

I'm talking bout a whole lotta history
I can't find a way to show what you mean to me
I've fallen all around when you miss me
I don't know what to do so tell me baby

Hello, did you call me?
I thought it didn't matter that you're gone
And I know, end of story
Now there's nothing but a shadow where my heart shone

I'm dammed if I do and I'm dammed and if I don't
But you cost me so much love, yeah
So finally I just decided to go
I know I've had enough, so tell me that you're not alone

I'm talking bout a whole lotta history
I can't find a way to show what you mean to me
I've fallen all around when you miss me
I don't know what to do so tell me baby

I'm talking bout a whole lotta history
I can't find a way to show what you mean to me
I've fallen all around when you miss me
I don't know what to do so tell me baby

And it keeps me spinning
And controls what happens to Monday, to Monday
And it might sound crazy 
But your voice still leaves me all funky, all funky

And it keeps me spinning
And controls what happens to Monday, to Monday
And it might sound crazy 
But your voice still leaves me all funky, all funky
