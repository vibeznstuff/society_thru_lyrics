I met a guy at the club
I let him know I'm alone
I let him know I'm in love
I met a girl at the bar
I let her know where you are

I told her you are the love of my life and
One day you gonna be my wife and
We are gonna have some babies together

I told him you are the man of my dreams
You saved me from drowning in the streams
I know we're really gonna last forever and ever

It was those, three words that saved my life
It wasn't complicated
Wasn't premeditated
It wasn't underrated
Boy I'm so glad you stayed and
It was those three words that saved my life
It wasn't complicated
Wasn't premeditated
To you I'm dedicated
So just go ahead and say it

I love you I love you
You are the love of my life my life
I love you I love you I love you
You are the love of my life my life

You know you're holding my heart
Can't nothing tear us apart
You know I'm so in love with you
Can't nothing tear us apart no

I said, i-l-o-v-e-y-o-u
I'm so into you girl
She said m-e-t-o-o
It's obvious I'm so into you boy
So why don't we (we) hold (hold) on (on) for (to) love (love)
Through the ups and downs never let go
Holding on forever never let go

It all started with three words that saved my life
It wasn't complicated
It wasn't complicated
It wasn't complicated
It wasn't complicated
Baby those three words that saved my life

I love you I love you
You are the love of my life my life
I love you I love you I love you
You are the love of my life my life
