Yo, sometimes you have to just be a man and apologize to your woman, ya star

The amount of ting whe you put her through
Rock this! 

When a girl cry cause of you 
Not one ting you can say or do
Make any man go change his mind
No matter what you wanna do
First you find it hard to speak (true)
Girl straight out make a brother weak
Killing me softly every time 
And all that I can be 


On the street just ballin
Girls have been callin 
Drop top fallin
Brothers keep rollin
Livin nothing but a street life (street life)
 

For all the troubles I brought ya
For all the time that you cried
Baby for that I apologize (apologize)
For all the time that I've hurt ya 
For bringing tears to your eye
Baby for that I apologize (apologize)
Well I can see it in your eyes 
No telling you no lies
Girl I did you wrong
You'll never find another guy
So this is what we got to do 
Make a family cause it's true
Girl you are a part of me
My heart belongs to you
Cause I can see it in your eyes 
No telling you no lies
Girl I did you wrong 
You'll never find another guy
This is what we got to do 
Make a family cause it's true
Girl you are a part of me 
My heart belongs to you now


On the street just ballin
Girls have been callin 
Drop top fallin
Brothers keep rollin
Livin nothing but a street life (street life)
 

Do you understand the feeling when I'm feeling 
When I tell you how I'm feeling 
When I'm feeling that way
Can't get over how you make everything better girl 
When you are around me you bring joy to my day
Don't know what I will do without you in my life 
I don't give a damn about what people wanna say
All I'm saying that (what) 
This is where I'm at (at) 
And I'd do anything to make you stay 


On the street just ballin
Girls have been callin 
Drop top fallin
Brothers keep rollin
Livin nothing but a street life (street life)
