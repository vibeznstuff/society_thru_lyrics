And oh I want to touch you
Over and over and over again

We've got two strong hearts
We stick together like the honey and the bee
You and me
We've got two strong hearts
Reaching out forever like a river to the sea
Running free

We've got two strong hearts
We stick together like the honey and the bee
You and me
We've got two strong hearts
Reaching out forever like a river to the sea

You and me
We've got two strong hearts
Reaching out forever like a river to the sea (River to the sea)
You and me

We've got two strong hearts
We stick together like the honey and the bee
You and me
We've got two strong hearts
Reaching out forever like a river to the sea

We've got
