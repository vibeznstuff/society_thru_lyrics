There's something beating here inside my body
And it's called a heart
You know how easy it is
To tear it apart
If I lend it to you
Will you keep it safe for me
I'll lend it to you
If you treat it tenderly
There's something beating here inside my body
And it's called a heart

There's a sun shining in the sky
But that's not the reason why
I'm feeling warm inside
The answer isn't classified, it's my heart
From the moment I started
I tried to be goodhearted
Yes I tried my best
And more or less
I spoke from my heart

There's a lot to be learnt
And you learn when you heart gets burnt

Hearts could never be owned
Hearts only come on loan
If I want it back
I will take it back, I'll take my heart
But I will try my best and more or less
I will speak from my heart
Yes I will speak from my heart
Speak from my heart
