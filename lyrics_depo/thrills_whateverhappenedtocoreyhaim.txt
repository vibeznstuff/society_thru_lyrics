Now don't you believe me
Oh can't you see I'm full of lies
Oh something
Oh something once pure
I came to the city
To build a mountain of envy
And to marry a Kennedy

So let's stay out tonight
I just can't stop it
I just can't stop it
Ooh, girl I say ooh
Whatever happened my friend
Ooh, girl I say ooh
Whatever happened my friend
Corey Haim

So if I betray you
I won't be the first
You won't be the last
Oh something
Oh something once pure

On Paramount Pictures
I'm Andy Warhol with other ....
Hey ...
I'm the American dream

So let's stay out tonight
You see, I just can't stop it
I just can't stop it
Ooh, girl I say ooh
Whatever happened my friend
Ooh, girl I say ooh
Whatever happened my friend
Yeah Corey Haim Haim Haim Haim

So put on that dress tonight
You see, we just can't stop it
We just can't stop it
Ooh, hey girl I said ooh
Whatever happened my friend
Corey Haim

Alright, alright... alllright
