You're home all alone, there's a buzz on your phone
Friends say she's out at the bar with her friends so you go
Show up, look around, but you don't see her face
They tell you she probably went back to her place so you go
Then you knock on the door, but she won't let you in
She ain't ready to do this again...

So you go all kinds of crazy just thinking that she might be gone
You go out of your mind at the thought that she finally moved on
She tells you it's over, this time she means it. She doesn't love you but you don't believe it

The beach where you met is a five hour drive
You know that you won't be sleeping tonight so you go
The ocean's just water, the beach is just sand. None of it matters, she ain't holding your hand so you go

So you go all kinds of crazy just thinking that she might be gone
You go out of your mind at the thought that she finally moved on
She tells you it's over, this time she means it. She doesn't love you but you don't believe it
So you go all out and try to fix everything that you did wrong

She tells you it's over, this time she means it. She doesn't love you but you don't believe it
So you go all out and try to fix everything that you did wrong

You're home all alone, there's a buzz on your phone, it's her and she asks if you wanna come over
