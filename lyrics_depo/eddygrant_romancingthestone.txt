I'm romancing the stone
Never leaving your poor heart alone
Every night and every day 
Gonna love the hurting away

I'm romancing the stone
Never leaving your poor heart alone
Every night and every day 
Gonna love the heartache away

Tonight, tonight I'm falling where the peaceful waters flow
Where the unicorn's the last one at the water hole
I have found a love so precious like an emerald so bold
It's a firelight escaping from the jeweller's hold.

I'm romancing the stone
Never leaving your poor heart alone
Every night and every day 
Gonna love the hurting away

I'm romancing the stone
Never leaving your poor heart alone
Every night and every day 
Gonna love the heartache away

I'm romancing the stone
Never leaving your poor heart alone
Every night and every day 
Gonna love the hurting away

I'm romancing the stone
Never leaving your poor heart alone
Every night and every day 
Gonna love the heartache away

Oh and in the heat of rapture when I feel the cold winds blow
Through the broken glass I'll see at last the sweet desire in you
I will climb up on my pulpit and I'll preach a sermon you
On the mountain roads in Harlem feel my jeweller's hold.

I'm romancing the stone
Never leaving your poor heart alone
Every night and every day 
Gonna love the hurting away

I'm romancing the stone
Never leaving your poor heart alone
Every night and every day 
Gonna love the heartache away
