You need a man that satisfies
Someone that cares for you
Someone to hold all through the night
Make your dreams come true
You need a man to treat you right
Who knows just what to do
Heart to heart or else you'll pass him by
Break his heart it two
Don't you know
Pretty baby
You drive me crazy
Fallin' for your love
Life is so good when I'm with you
Just bein' friends is not enough
Say, could one day, maybe
You be my lady
Together we'd be one
I thought you would realize 
That I'm savin' all my love
24/7
I'll be right here waitin' for you
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Thinkin' 'bout lovin' you
Kissin' and lovin' you
Can't get you off my mind
So take my hand
Girl don't be shy
I promise I'll be true
Follow on, just you and I
Share our love that's new
Hold me
Love me
Never let me go
Anything, girl, I'll sacrifice
Just to be with you
Don't you know
Pretty baby
You drive me crazy
Drive me crazy
I'm fallin' for your love
If it's too good to be with you
That's why bein' friends is not enough
Say, could one day, maybe 
You be my lady
Be my lady
Together we'd be one
One day, girl, you'll realize
That I'm savin' all my love
24/7
I'll be right here waitin' for you
Can't get you off my mind

Can't get you off my mind
Thinkin' 'bout lovin' you
Kissin' and huggin' you
Can't get you off my mind
I think about you all the time
24/7
24/7
I'll be right here waitin' for you 
Can't get you off mymind
Thinkin' 'bout lovin' you
Kissin' and huggin' you
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
24/7
I'll be right here waitin' for you
Oh baby
Can't get you off my mind
Oh baby
Can't get you off my mind
Baby, I'm waitin', I'm waitin', I'm waitin', I'm waitin' for you
24/7

Can't get you off my mind
Baby
Thinkin' 'bout loving you
Kissin' and huggin' you
Can't get you off my mind

I'll be right here waitin' for you
'Cause I want you
Can't get you off my mind
And I need you
Thinkin' 'bout lovin' you
