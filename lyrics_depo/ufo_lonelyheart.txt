Sarah has her dreams and makes her plans
To get what she wants when she can
A little bit of heaven was all she asked for
In the silent moments deep in the night
She'd find herself make it feel all right
Hungers for the bright light and something more

With her young heart so gently beating
A secret rendezvous love was meeting
Out in the night, out in the night night night night
Played on the radio, heard on the news
Baby's gone lost they found her shoes
You can turn out the light
You better turn out the light

 You go walking on the wild side
Learn how to run 'cause you can't hide
Better steel yourself away
Another page, another day
In your lonely heart
Beating out in the dark
Lonely heart

And beneath the lights the rock 'n' roll band
Electric guitars, one night stands
Are you giving away, giving away
With hungry and oh so desperate eyes
The souls who get hurt believe in their lies
You only betray only betray



And now you cry yourself to sleep
Against the odds you wanted to beat
You never say no, never say no no no no
Left with the promises that you swore
The price you pay is the love you tore
Now where did it go, where did it go
