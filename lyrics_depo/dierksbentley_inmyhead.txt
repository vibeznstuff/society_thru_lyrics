You completely disappeared,
You could be a million miles from here,
You’re doin’ fine from what I hear, lately.
I guess you found your destiny,
If this is really how it’s meant to be,
Then movin’ on sounds good to me, baby

But you’re still in my arms, in my head
You’re still in my car, in my head
You’re still in that t-shirt on my bed
You’re every song that’s on, you’re gone but you never left
In my head...
Yeah, you’re still in my head

I sit and watch the sun go down.
Guess that’s the way our love is now,
Just a flame burnin’ out, slowly.
But I don’t hang my head to cry,
I don’t have to be alone tonight,
Don’t worry ‘bout me baby, I’m not lonely

You’re still in my arms, in my head
You’re still in my car, in my head
You’re still in that t-shirt on my bed
You’re every song that’s on, you’re gone but you never left
In my head...
Yeah, you’re still in my head
You’re still in my head

You’re still in that t-shirt on my bed
You’re every song that’s on, you’re gone
But you’re in my arms, in my head
You’re still in my car, in my head
Yeah, you’re still in my head, my head
Girl, you’re still in my head, my head
