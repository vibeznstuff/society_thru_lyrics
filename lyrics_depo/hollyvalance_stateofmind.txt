You dont need to hang around 
you dont need to talk right now 
got a feeling its the same mistake 
got a feeling its gonna break 


Somedays, sometimes, this dont feel right 

 
Too hard to touch, its getting to much 
you know its just a state of mind 
driving you wild get caught up inside
you know its just a state of mind 


All i need is to breathe 
all i need is to believe 
can i have it now i know 
gotta have it take it slow 


Somedays, sometimes, it just goes right 


Too hard to touch, its getting to much 
you know its just a state of mind 
driving you wild get caught up inside
you know its just a state of mind 

state of mind 
state of mind 


Too hard to touch, its getting to much 
you know its just a state of mind 
driving you wild get caught up inside
you know its just a state of mind 

Too hard to touch, its getting to much 
you know its just a state of mind 
driving you wild get caught up inside
you know its just a state of mind 

you know its just a state if mind
