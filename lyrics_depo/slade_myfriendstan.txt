My friend Stan’s got a funny old man
Oh yeah, oh yeah 
He makes him work all night 'til he can’t do it right
Oh yeah, aha 
And from the way you blacked my eye, 
I know that you’re the reason why 
And from the way you fix his tie 
I see you're gettin’ to him, gettin’ to him 

My friend Jack’s got an ache in his back 
Oooooh  oh yeah 
The doc said he’d be fine if he’d just take his time 
Ohh oh, ooh 
And from the way you blacked my eye 
I know that you’re the reason why 
And from the way you fix his tie 
I see you're gettin’ to him, you've been gettin’ to him - kinky! 

And from the way you blacked my eye 
I know that you’re the reason why 
And from the way you fix his tie 
I see you're gettin’ to him, you've been gettin’ to him 

My friend Pete says his body is weak
Oh yeah, aha 
He told me he can’t sleep and his temperature’s steep
Oh yeah, woho 
And from the way you blacked my eye, 
I know that you’re the reason why 
And from the way you fix his tie 
I see you're gettin’ to him, you've been gettin’ to him, 
You've been gettin’ to him, you've been gettin’ to him
Oh yeah!
