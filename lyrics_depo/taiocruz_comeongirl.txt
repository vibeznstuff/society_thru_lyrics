Baby girl you know that I just want to
take you to the spot,
Do things to you that are definitely go'n
get you hot,
I love how you shake that little booty
around the club,
I just wanna turn you, me, into an us,
Only wanna party with you nobody else
can do,
We can do whatever, keep it public or if
you,
Wanna keep it private and undercover
that's cool,
I just wanna stay under the covers with
you


Now I know that you want me, you've
indicated, It's obvious I need to just
make a decision
Bout what I'm gonna say, Tell, me what I
gotta say
Tell me what I gotta say,
To take you away, with me
To take you away, with me
To take you away, with me
To take you away


Come on girl, Come on girl,Come on
girl, Hey ... 

I can see the look inside you eyes and I
know that you want it,
You're flirty, flirty with me and I love the
way you flaunt it,
You know that you're the shit, and that
you, own the club,
I just wanna turn you, me, into an us,
Only wanna party with you nobody else
can do,
We can do whatever, keep it public or if
you,
Wanna keep it private and undercover
that's cool,
I just wanna stay under the covers with
you




You wanna take a bite, come whet my
appetite, Plug, plug me in, do your thing,
make my head spin,
So come and take me away, you better
take me away,
You better hit the spot, if you want I can
make you pop,
So let go, electro, take it nice and slow,
Come on boy, come on boy, come on
boy...
