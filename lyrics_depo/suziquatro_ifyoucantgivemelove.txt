Well I've seen you before on that discotheque floor
You were driving me out of my mind
But I could have swore that I saw something more in your eyes
Although you were surrounded by beauty unbounded
Your glance was intended for me
And though I tried to hide it I found myself looking to see you
So then you took your chances, you made your advances
Your touch took my breath away
But when you said hello, are you ready to go
Well I had just one thing to say

If you can't give me love honey, that aint enough
Let me go look for somebody else
If you can't give me feelings with old fashioned meanings
You're just in love with yourself

If you can't give me love (Love)
If you can't give me love (Love)
If you can't give me love (Love) 
If you can't give me love (Love)
If you can't give me love (Love)

Well you may be the king of this discotheque scene
But honey I ain't looking for that
What I need is a man, not Some so-called aristocrat

Oh if only you'd waited, just hesitated, or maybe just asked me to dance
But you really don't know why I don't want to go
And baby that's why we Don't stand a chance

So if you can't give me love honey, that aint enough
Let me go look for somebody else
If you can't give me feelings with old fashioned meanings
You're just in love with yourself
If you can't give me love (Love)
If you can't give me love (Love)
If you can't give me love (Love)
If you can't give me love (Love)
If you can't give me love (Love)
Oh if you can't give me love

Honey, that aint enough
Let me go look for   Somebody else
If you can't give me feelings with old fashioned meanings
You're just in love with yourself

If you can't give me love honey, that aint enough
Let me go look for somebody else
If you can't give me feelings with old fashioned meanings
You're just in love with yourself

If you can't give me love (Love)
If you can't give me love (Love)
If you can't give me love (Love)
If you can't give me love (Love)
If you can't give me love (Love)
If you can't give me love (Love)
If you can't give me love (Love)
If you can't give me love (Love)
Give me love (Love)
Give me love (Love)
Give me love (Love)
Give me love (Love)
Give me love (Love)
