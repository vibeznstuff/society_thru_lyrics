How long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?

Well your friends and their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme,
but I can't help but have my suspictions,
'cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem.

Well you said you was never intending
to break up our scene in this way,
but there ain't any use in pretending
it could happen to us any day,

How long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?
How long and how long has this been going on?
How long and how long has this been going on?
How long baby?

Oh, your friends and their gentle persuation
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme,
but I can't help but have my suspictions,
'cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem.

Well you said you was never intending
to break up our scene in this way,
but there ain't any use in pretending
it could happen to us any day,

Tell me honey
How long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?
How long and how long has this been going on,
going on, going on?
how long has this been going on?

how long has this been going on,
going on, going on, going on?
How long, honey, oh, has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?
how long has this been going on, going on, going on, going on?
how long has this been going on, going on, going on?

You been treaten me mad you been treaten me bad
and it's been going on, going on, going on
I ain't quite as dumb as I seem.
I ain't quite the fool you mean
but it's been going on, going on, going on, going on.
