You swept me off my feet from the moment I met you
Thought I was so lucky baby I let you
Into my heart, into my heart
When you started messing 'round
Boy I was blind sighted 
Never saw the real you
You were just hiding
Your lies in the dark
But now I see who you are

Boy I'm gonna stop you
Before you get a chance to
Break another heart

I'm gonna make you famous
Tell 'em all about you
Gonna all know what your name is
All over this town
I'm gonna make you famous
Tell 'em all the whole truth
Don't you know what goes around comes around

Yeah I'm gonna make you famous, famous
oh oh oh oh
Yeah I'm gonna make you famous, famous
oh oh oh oh

When you walk in the bar
Everyone'll stop talking
Know who you are
You can hear a pin dropping
They're gonna stare
They'll know you everywhere

Boy I'm gonna stop you
Before you get a chance to 
Break another heart

Yeah I'm gonna make you famous
Tell 'em all about you
Gonna all know what your name is
All over this town
I'm gonna make you famous
Tell 'em all the whole truth
Don't you know what goes around comes around
Yeah I'm gonna make you famous, famous
oh oh oh oh
I'm gonna make you famous, famous
oh oh oh oh

I'm gonna make you wish you never lied to me
Wish you never tried to be somebody that you ain't
I'm gonna make you think before you cheat again
On anyone like me again

I'm gonna make you famous
Tell 'em all about you
Gonna all know what your name is
All over this town
I'm gonna make you famous
Tell 'em all the whole truth
Don't you know what goes around comes around

Yeah I'm gonna make you famous
Tell 'em all about you
Gonna all know what your name is
All over this town
I'm gonna make you famous
Tell 'em all the whole truth
Don't you know what goes around comes around

Yeah I'm gonna make you famous, famous
oh oh oh oh
I'm gonna make you famous, famous
