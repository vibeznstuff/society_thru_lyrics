I never knew there was a love like this before 
Never had someone.. to show me, a love, 
Love like this before 

Now that, we have, come to be 
A brand new light, I can't see 
Never thought you'd be a special, part of me, no baby 
The reasons, are, because of you 
I can go on, and make it through 
I can't even take my mind off loving you 
And I wanna say 

I never knew there was a love like this before 
Never had someone.. to show me, a love, 
Love like this before 

I know you, can't see, 
all the things you mean to me 
I'm so amazed, that you, are mine, 
yeah yeah, yeah yeah 
If we can work together, 
maybe this can last forever 
This is something, 
that I want to hold on to...ooh ooh ooh ooh 
So baby try to understand 

Baby try to understand 
I'll be crazy if you leave (crayzay) 
cause you compliment my style(ooh, ooh ooh oooh ooh) 
And I like the way you walk 
(the way you walk,the way you talk) 
And the sexy things you talk 
You don't know just what you do to me, 
you see(oh ooh oh ooh oh) 

(never, never, no no) 
I never knew, there was a love like this before 
(a love like this before, no) 
Never had someone to show me a love, 
(oh, I never had a, love like this before) 
Love like this before
