Fight for your right to exist


Fight for your right to exist

He called me a dyke,
I called him an ambulance
I can make you famous too, but you tremble at the thought of that
I've seen more spine in jellyfish
That's an invertebrate, Google that
I've been in the shadows long enough
I got nothing to lose so I'm playing rough
So humdrum, so dumb
You picked a fight with the wrong one
You brought a butter knife to a tank fight
I put you on blast then fucked your wife
Weapon systems activated
Your ego's been deflated
All choked up you need a ventilator
She seemed so sweet I had to taste her
Let's get one thing straight, I'm not
Sex is art, I'm Basquiat
Love is love it can't be stopped
So go fuck yourself 'cause it's all you got
Go fuck yourself 'cause it's all you got

Fight for your right to exist


Coming out swinging...

I am a pariah to every religion
It isn't a choice, but it is a decision
Come out of the closet
Break out of the prison
Love who you are
Let no one inhibit
Don't get in your way, or make a mistake of living in fear for the rest of your days
So tighten your fists, and firmly say the follow the phrase

He called me a dyke
I called him an ambulance
I can make you famous too, but you tremble at the thought of that


So go fuck yourself, this is all you got

Last but not least let me finish the story how I met your girl,
And we fucked till the morning
Then she found religion in every position screaming "OH God! ", and singing in hymnals
"Gay for a day", that's what she claimed, but that's what these chicks always say
She's calling my home, texting my phone, sending me snaps, and begging for more
So say what you say, do what you do, but I'll always get more pussy than you
I'll always get more pussy than you
