I'm working in a retail store,
It's not what I'm cut out for.
I live for my breaks, I know there's something more,
So much to explore, but it feels so far away.

I'm not lost, I'm just finding
My own way in the world
I'm not lost, I'm just finding
My own way in the world
In the big old world

Do you ever, do you ever, do you wonder
Wonder where your dreams go?
Do you fell like you're going under,
Under it all?


I don't know if it's bad or good
Walking down this street without you
I don't know quite what I want, one thing I've got
Is a good idea of what I'm not

I'm not lost, I'm just finding
My own way in the world
I'm not lost, I'm just finding
My own way in the world
In the big old world

Do you ever, do you ever, do you wonder
Wonder where your dreams go?
Do you fell like you're going under,
Under it all?


And I storm out of work and I take my seat
At the front of the bus and my headphones bleed
And right there in a flash, with tears on my cheeks
I can suddenly see

We're not lost, we're just finding
Our own way in the world
We're not lost, we're just finding
Our own way in the world
In the big old world

Do you ever, do you ever, do you wonder
Wonder where your dreams go?
Do you fell like you're going under,
Under it all?


I'm not lost, I'm just finding
My own way in the world
In the big old world
