Put a spell on you, 'cause you're mine
Better stop the things you do
Oh I ain't lying, no, I'm not lying

You know I can't stand it
You're running around, you know better daddy
You're putting me down and you know I can't stand it
Your running around, you know better daddy

Put a spell on you, 'cause you're mine
Better stop the things you do
Oh I ain't lying, no, I'm not lying, no

I don't care if you don't want me
I'm yours right now
You know I can't stand it baby
You don't want me, I'm yours right now

Put a spell on you, 'cause you're mine
You better stop the things you do
'Cause I ain't lying, oh, I'm not lying, no

Put a spell on you, 'cause you're mine
Better stop the things you do
I ain't lying

Put a spell on you, 'cause you're mine
You better stop the things you do
You better stop the things
Stop the things that you do

Put a spell on you, 'cause you're mine
You better stop the things you do
No, I'm not lying
Put a spell on you
