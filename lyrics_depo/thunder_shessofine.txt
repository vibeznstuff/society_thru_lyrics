It was early in the evening, I was waiting for a train
I was thinking to myself as I watched the pouring rain
I need love, but I don't know where to get it
Then underneath this big umbrella she walked in the waiting room
I just had to tell her though it might have been too soon
I need love and I think I might have found it

She was some kind of priestess with a black dress on
With her film star kind of features, she really turned me on

And if it takes until forever and a day, I've gotta make that woman mine
If I don't tell her then I'll wish my life away, she's so fine, she's so fine

I said don't misunderstand me, I didn't mean to make you blush
But when I got this feeling, I knew I had to rush
I need love, and you know I want to give it

I've been waiting for a lifetime for a woman like you
I know I'm walking on a fine line, but I've got to see it through

If I should pass away tonight while I'm asleep
At least I'll know I spoke my mind
I'm being driven by some other force that won't be denied, she's so fine

She's so fine

I've been waiting for a lifetime for a woman like you
I know I'm walking on a fine line, but I've got to see it through, through

She's so fine, she's so fine, she's so fine
Ooh, I took one look at you baby, babe it feels so good inside
She's so fine, makes me feel good...
