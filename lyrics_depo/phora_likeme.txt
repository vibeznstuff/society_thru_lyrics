Girl if I was him
Id never make you feel like that
Hate to be blunt
But I just gotta keep it real like that
Ill never know why
He wanna make you feel like that
But if you were mine babe
Yea if you were mine babe
If you were mine 
I would give you all the love 
That you need from me
Treat you like you're royalty 
You're a queen to me
Ima show you what you're worth
What you mean to me
Probably make you fall in love
Make you fiend for me
Fuck you so good till you dream of me
Ain't no question I got you
Girl its just something about you
I don't know no one 
That's good enough for you
But baby that nigga
Ain't nothing with out you
She just wanna roll in the benzo
Roll one up
Blow the smoke out the window
Said she only gets high
When she feel low
And she tryna hide her feelings
But her friends know
Her friends know
That she better off alone
Should've left that nigga
Momma even said 
She don't respect that nigga
Wish she never met that nigga
Babygirl you should move on
And forget that nigga

For a nigga like me
Cause I can guarantee 
He ain't never did it like me
I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can tell you ain't happy
Where you at right now
Way to good to take him back 
Right now
So where you at right now...

He got nothing to say
He just wanna fuck around
He just stuck in his ways
Hes no different from these niggas
They all one in the same
And everytime he fucks you over
You're the one that he blames
Look 
To be honest girl
You better off alone
Always worried bout who sending
Them messages to his phone
You don't need him baby
You deserve better
You should've known
You was better off on your own
But these things take time
Girl he wasn't loyal 
He was fucking with your mind
Not saying I'm better
But that wont happen if you're mine
Baby not ever
He did you wrong so many times
You looking for something
You ain't never gonna find
Cause you way to good 
For a nigga not to give you
What you need 
You deserve better
You need someone like me (like me)
No telling what that might be...

I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can guarantee
He ain't never did it like me
I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can tell 
You ain't happy where you at right now
Way to good to take him back right now
So where you at right now 

I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can tell you ain't happy
Were you at right now
You way to good 
To take him back right now
So where you at right now...
So where you at right now...
So where you at right now...
I can tell you ain't happy 
Where you at right now
You way to good 
To take him back right now
So where you at right now...

I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can guarantee
He ain't never did it like me
I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can tell 
You ain't happy where you at right now
Way to good to take him back right now
So where you at right now
