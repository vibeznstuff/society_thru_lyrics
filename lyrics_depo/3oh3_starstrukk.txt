Nice legs, Daisy Dukes,
Makes a man go ,
That's the way they all come through like ,
Low-cut, see-through shirts that make ya ,
That's the way she come through like ,

'Cause I just set them up,
Just set them up,
Just set them up tonight (to knock them down),
'Cause I just set them up,
Just set them up,
Just set them up tonight,
to knock them down

I think I should know how to make love to something innocent without leaving my fingerprints
Out,
Now,
L-o-v-e's just another word I never learned to pronounce,
How do I say I'm sorry 'cause the word is never gonna come out,
Now,
L-o-v-e's just another word I never learned to pronounce

Tight jeans, double D's makin' me go ,
All the people on the street know ,
Iced out, lit-up make the kids go ,
All the people on the street know ,

'Cause I just set them up,
Just set them up,
Just set them up tonight (to knock them down),
'Cause I just set them up,
Just set them up,
Just set them up tonight,
to knock them down

I think I should know how to make love to something innocent without leaving my fingerprints
Out,
Now,
L-o-v-e's just another word I never learned to pronounce,
How do I say I'm sorry 'cause the word is never gonna come out,
Now,
L-o-v-e's just another word I never learned to pronounce

Push it baby, push it baby,
Out of control,
I got my gun cocked tight and I'm ready to blow,
Push it baby, push it baby,
Out of control,
This is the same old dance that you already know,
Push it baby, push it baby,
Out of control,
I got my gun cocked tight and I'm ready to blow,
Push it baby, push it baby,
Out of control,
This is the same old dance that you already know
