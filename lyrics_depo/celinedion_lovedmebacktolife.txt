I was walking dead
Stuck inside my head
I couldn't get out
Turned the lights down
The voices inside were so loud

Needed a jump start
Catatonia
I couldn't feel
I wished that I could disappear
The voices inside were so real

But you stood by my side
Night after night, night after night

You loved me back to life, life
From the coma
The wait is over
You loved me back to life, life
From the coma
We're lovers again tonight

Back to life, back to life, back to life, back to life, yeah, yeah

You woke me up, one touch and I felt alive
You loved me back to life
Back to life, thought I'd die
The voices inside were so quiet

But you stood by my side
Night after night, night after night

You loved me back to life, life
From the coma
The wait is over
You loved me back to life, life
From the coma.
We're lovers again tonight

Strong hands, thick skin and an open heart
You saw through the pain, saw through the mask
You never gave up on me, yeah

Life, life
From the coma
The wait is over
You loved me back to life, life
From the coma
We're lovers again tonight

Back to life, back to life, back to life, back to life
Back to life, back to life, back to life, back to life
Yeah, yeah...
