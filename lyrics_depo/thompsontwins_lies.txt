You told me you loved me
So I don't understand
Why promises are snapped in two
And words are made to bend
(The bigger, the better)
Some stolen from Japan
Collected from around the world
They'll catch you if they can

Lies lies lies yeah
Lies lies lies yeah
Lies lies lies yeah
Lies lies lies yeah

Do I have to catch you out
To know what's on your mind?
Well, Cleopatra died for Egypt
What a waste of time

White ones and red ones
And some you can't disguise
Twisted truth and half the news
Can't hide it in your eyes

Lies lies lies yeah
Lies lies lies yeah
Lies lies lies yeah
Lies lies lies yeah

You say you'll try harder
But I think it's just too late
Well the car is revving in the drive
And I'm not the sort to wait

(The bigger, the better)
Some nicked from old saigon
Collected from around the world
Love lies on and an and on and on and on and

Lies lies lies yeah (they're gonna get you)
Lies lies lies yeah (they won't forget you)
Lies lies lies yeah (they're gonna get you)
Lies lies lies yeah

Oh you know I know

Lies lies lies yeah
