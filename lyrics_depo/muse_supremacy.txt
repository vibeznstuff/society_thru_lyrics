Wake to see
Your true emancipation is a fantasy
Policies
Have risen up and overcome the brave

Greatness dies
Unsung and lost, invisible to history
Embedded spies
Brainwashing our children to be mean

You don't have long
I am on to you
The time, it has come to destroy

Your supremacy
Supremacy

You don't have long
I am on to you
The time, it has come to destroy

Your supremacy
Supremacy
