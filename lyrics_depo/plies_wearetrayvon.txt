I never thought that wearing no hoodie, could cause your life.
And I never thought you could just kill somebody and go out the same night.
Every dog that you see that bark, don't mean that he bite.
And everything thats black ain't evil, everything that's pure ain't white
Cause you think that I'm doin wrong don't mean that you right.
Cause the ones that you think that won't, them the ones that might.
Certain people in this world the system don't like.
When you living what you worth is how they value your life.
I can do all things through christ, who strengthen me.
And even when I pray I pray for my enemies.
And Pac said it best "only God can judge me."
Trayvon lil homie, I want you to know you really touched me.

Sometimes trying to live right, sometimes it seems so wrong,
Sometimes you tryin to get justice, sometimes it take so long.
But the ones they supposed to keep in, be the ones they let go home.
But the ones that hustle and survive, be the ones they hold  with no bond.
My son supposed to burry me, but I ain't posed to burry my son.
You can call me nigga all you want, but you ain't pose to treat me like one,
Pose to be able to express my self, and be able to dress how I want.
Pose to be able to go where I please, and be able to leave when I'm done.
Should I think that you sell dope, just cause you drive a benz.
Should I think that zack in a gang, just cause he sag his pants.
Whats right is right, whats wrong is wrong,
Trayvon martin, you'll forever live on.
