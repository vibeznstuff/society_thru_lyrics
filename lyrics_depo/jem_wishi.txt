Baby, you're sailing today
Baby, you're sailing away
Sugar, wish I could go too
But honey you know
I'm happy for you

Wish I, I wish I, I wish I
Wish I was going too

Baby, your ship has come in
Baby, adventures will begin
Sugar, don't you worry 'bout me
Coz honey you know
Want you to be happy

Wish I, I wish I, I wish I
Wish I was going too

But if you find that you don't like it
That the people there aren't inviting
Or that city life is too frightening
Won't you come home
But if you find that you don't like it
That the people there aren't inviting
Or that city life is too frightening
Won't you come home
Please come home

Wish I, I wish I, I wish I
Wish I was going too
Wish I, I wish I, I wish I
Wish I was going too
