I'll tell you what I think, I think she's a cow
She's let you down too many times now
Let's go for a drink, forget it for now
Put It behind you, I think it's your round

Cause you're my mate and I will stand by you
You're my mate and I will stand by you
And in the face of things that could hurt you
You're my mate and I will stand by you
Cause you're my mate and I will stand by you
You're my mate and I will stand by you
And in the face of things that could hurt you
You're my mate and I will stand by you
Cause you're my mate

I'll tell you what I think, I think he's a pain
He ain't got a car, but he drives you insane
Let's go for a drink and sink a few
Enough about him let's talk about you

Cause you're my mate and I will stand by you
You're my mate and I will stand by you
Cause you're my mate and I will stand by you

You're my mate and I will stand by you
And in the face of things that could hurt you
You're my mate and I will stand by you
Cause you're my mate

All I wanna do is get drunk here with you
All I wanna do is get drunk here with you
All I wanna do is get drunk here with you
All I wanna do is get drunk here with you

Cause you're my mate and I will stand by you
You're my mate and I will stand by you
And in the face of things that could hurt you
You're my mate and I will stand by you
Cause you're my mate and I will stand by you
You're my mate and I will stand by you
And in the face of things that could hurt you
You're my mate and I will stand by you

Cause you're my mate
Cause you're my mate
Cause you're my mate
Cause you're my mate
Cause you're my mate
