Everyday when I'm away
I'm thinking of you
Everyone can carry on
Except for we two.

And you know that our love
And you know that I
And you know that our love won't die.

And it won't even show
And no-one will know
One little wave
To say you'll behave
It won't even show
How far love can go.

Everyday when I'm away
And there's been a few
Every land I need a hand
To help me come through.

And you know that our love
And you know that I
And you know that our love won't die.

And it won't even show
And no-one will know
One little wave
To say you'll behave
It won't even show
How far love can go.

And you know that our love
And you know that I
And you know that our love won't die.

And it won't even show
And no-one will know
One little wave
To say you'll behave
It won't even show
How far love can go.
