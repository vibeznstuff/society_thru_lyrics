Going over to susan's house
Walking south down baxter street 
Nothing hiding behind this picket fence
There's a crazy old woman smashing bottles 
On the sidewalk where her house burnt down two years ago
People say that back then she really wasn't that crazy 

Going over to susan's house
Going over to susan's house
She's gonna make it right 

Down by the donut prince 
A fifteen year old boy lies on the sidewalk 
With a bullet in his forehead
In a final act of indignity 
The paramedics take off all his clothes 
For the whole world to see 
While they put him in the bag
Meanwhile an old couple argues inside the queen bee
The sick fluorescent light shimmering on their skin

Going over to susan's house
Going over to susan's house
I can't be alone tonight

Take a left down echo park
A kid asks do i want some crack
Tv sets are spewing baywatch 
Through the windows into black 

Here comes a girl with long brown hair
Who can't be more than seventeen
She sucks on a red popsicle while she pushes a baby girl
In a pink carriage 
And i'm thinking that must be her sister
That must be her sister, right?
They go into the 7-11
And i keep walking 

Going over to susan's house
