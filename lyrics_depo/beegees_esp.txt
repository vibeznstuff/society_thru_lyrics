Dark is the night
High is the fire
Touches the sky
Love with no shape or form
I am in your mind's eye
Just let your dreams run wild

Somewhere, out across the nation
Someone, waiting in the shadows
Listen, I don't wanna hear
Return to, sender
Calling, I can see the future
Someday, signal with a single motion
Show me you believe in someone, somewhere

Oh baby you, you give, me
You give me the runaround
Just another night, with, you
You're on my mind
And we got love
And love'll take you higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher


E.S.P
I communicate with you
Tell me what it means to feel
What am I supposed to do
E.S.P
Nothing any words can say
Nothing that we know is real
But it'll take your breath away
Your breath away

Danger, suddenly an early warning
Suddenly the soul is burning
But I still believe in someone, somewhere

Baby you, give, me
You give me the runaround
Just another night with you
I'm in your mind
And we got love
And love'll take you higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher

E.S.P
I communicate with you
Tell me what it means to feel
What am I supposed to do
E.S.P
And love'll take you higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher

Be prepared to make your sacrifice, tonight
Far beyond the point of no return, oh no

And we got love
And love'll take you higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher, higher and higher
