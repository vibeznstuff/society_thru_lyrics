It doesn't really matter now you're gone 
You never were around that much to speak of 
Didn't think that I could live without you, baby 
It couldn't be that hard to live alone 

But I'm all, all alone again 
Thinking you will never say 
that you'll be home again 

And it's gonna be a long night 
And it's gonna be cold without your arms 
And I`m gonna get stage fright caught 
in the headlights 
It's gonna be a long night 
And I know I'm gonna lose this fight 

Once upon a time we fell in love 
And I thought that I would be the only one 

But now I'm on, I'm on my own again 
Thinking you will never show 
you won't be home again 

And it's gonna be a long night 
And it's gonna be cold without your arms 
And I`m gonna get stage fright caught 
in the headlights 
It's gonna be a long night 
And I know I'm gonna lose this fight 

Lost in you arms baby 
Lost in your arms 

Now I'm on my own again 
Thinking you will never show 
you won't be home again 

And it's gonna be a long night 
And it's gonna be cold without your arms 
And I`m gonna get stage fright caught 
in the headlights 
It's gonna be a long night 
And I know I'm gonna lose this fight 
I'm gonna get stage fright caught in the headlights 

It's gonna be a long night 
And I know I'm gonna lose this fight 
I'm lost in your arms baby 
Lost in your arms
