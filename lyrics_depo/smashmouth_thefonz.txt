I wanna try your shoes on
And wear them for a day
Learn to talk like you do
And say what I see
I'd talk like I knew something
That everyone wanted to hear 

But you're the fonz 

The definition of icy
The measure of what's up
You could play the tuba
And everyone would clap
Well I can play the tuba
And they all just shake their heads 

Cause you're the fonz 

I know its over for me
I know its over 

Drove my car to the floor
And stood at the edge
When I woke up in heaven
Looked down and no one cared
But when you pulled your own trigger
They all gathered around to watch 

Cause you're the fonz
