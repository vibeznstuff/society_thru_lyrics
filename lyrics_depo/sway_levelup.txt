We level up, up, up, up, we level up
Yeah, we level up
We gonna climb up the levels, go harder
Like splash every time we go past
I'll never loose the game, I'm gonna last
So let's start, we level up

All over the radio and back up in the raves again
We got the crowd on the wave like it's a stadium
Call me the weather man it's about to be a break weekend
I'm on the cloud, let's make it rain again
Yeah, we level up
Life's but nothing, shirts and dressed looking saucy
Living in our minuses, cause life begins at 40 level up
Call me Bond, James Bond
How I maintain, I tell them winter stays on
My brain racing like I'm trying to win the gold for Britain, yes!
I'm an one track man, let's go the distance
We're only stopping when we pose for pictures
And now we move so wavy, we get motion sickness

Yeah, we level up
We gonna climb up the levels, go harder
Like splash every time we go past
I'll never loose the game, I'm gonna last
So let's start, we level up

Feeling like a just won the lotto
Pop a bottle and I make them say A
Like I'm your dentist
Keys to the sweet, you can call me Alan Sugar
Well we're firing tonight, and I might need an apprentice
Reunion, old school and uni friends
It's your excuse to act like hooligans
Bend and break the rules again
Parties just getting started at 2 am
Waking up at noon next to
Who are you again?

Looking in the mirror and I feel like I'm famous
I got that glimmer in my eye like I ain't afraid of danger
Today could be the day that everything changes
I'm trying to move up to the hills where idols become neighbors
One moment, your whole world rearranges
You feeling like you graduating Oxford or Cambridge
Forever roll the dice and have it looking like Vegas
You win some you loose some, but only winners take risks

I start getting calls I've been waiting on for ages
Phone starts popping and I'm gossiping with strangers
In and out a lot and I'm out getting wasted
All of these flashing lights popping out in places
Always forgetting names, especially with neighbors
Names ladies
What's your name again
My house, like talk
Wake up in the tea, saying touch me I'm famous
Hey stranger, where you been? Long time no see
Time to level up
I'm in the game, play to win
Another round on me

Yeah, we level up
We gonna climb up the levels, go harder
Like splash every time we go past
I'll never loose the game, I'm gonna last
So let's start, we level up
