I ... I will learn to live before I die
Will learn to love and learn to try
Not to give it all away (give it all away)
She ... she may be
The one that's meant for me
Or for the man that I used to be (used to be)
Til' I gave it all away (gave it all away )

Why hy hy I lay my heart down on the floor
I showed you love, you wanted more re re
But I gave it all away (cry ry ry ry cry ry ry ry)

You taught me to see the better truth
About yourself but about me too (about me too)
I was stupid over you
What could I do

Why hy hy I lay my heart down on the floor
I showed you love, you wanted more re re
But I gave it all away (cry ry ry ry cry ry ry ry)

Some people wait a lifetime for a chance like this
I've waited enough
Baby, no, I won't let you go
I'm sick of tears and bitter fears

(ohh no woah a woah )

Why hy hy I lay my heart down on the floor
I showed you love, you wanted more re re
But I gave it all away (cry ry ry ry cry ry ry ry)

Why hy hy I lay my heart down on the floor
I showed you love, you wanted more re re
But I gave it all away (cry ry ry ry cry ry ry ry)

There's nothing left to take (cry ry ry ry cry ry ry ry ry)

I gave it all away
