When you can look at her picture and not wanna kiss her no more,
When you don't feel like you've been hit by a train at the sound of someone saying her name anymore
When you can drive down the road and not be afraid of what's playing on the radio…

That's when you know it's over
That's when you know you've made it over to the other side,
Ready for another ride
That's when you know it's over

When the time of the year don't stir up the tears anymore
When it don't feel like the past is a gun and there's nowhere to run anymore
When it don't take every bone to not dial her number just leave her alone

That's when you know it's over
That's when you know you've made it over to the other side,
Ready for another ride
That's when you know it's over

When you wouldn't go back even if you could
When hearing she's happy finally feels good

That's when you know it's over
That's when you know you've made it over to the other side,
Ready for another ride
That's when you know it's over

That's when you know it's over
