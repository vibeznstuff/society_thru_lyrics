Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here don't put out the glow

Hold me now, don't bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man that I've become

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part,
Kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful, loneliness is tragical
So, help me, I can't win this war, oh no

Touch me now, don't bother
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man I've become

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part,
Kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

I'm lookin' back on things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
Or keep you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part,
Kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part,
Kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of...
Show you the shape of my heart
