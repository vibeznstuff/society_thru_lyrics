Somebody better give me a sting
Somebody better make me bleed
Fill this vacancy underneath my skin
Cos i'm fighting with a thorn in my side
I never meant to fall this far
I have grown the soul of an enemy
But i hold and element of surprise
God knows its gonna make you smile

Breathin' immortality
I'm falling down one thousand feet

So lets gather with the gods tonight
And play truant for the final time
I've been strung from hell
Give me birth again
Cos i never meant to fall this far
My guts are gonna drop like flies
Take these promises with a fist of salt
Cos i hold an element of surprise
And god know its gonna make you smile

Breathin' immortality
I'm falling down one thousand feet
And oh my god one hundred floors
Flash faster than my eyes can meet

Give me something sacred
So deep so high so long so far so good so much pressure building

They won't break me they won't ground me

Breathin' immortality
I'm falling down one thousand feet
And oh my god one hundred floors
Flash faster than my eyes can meet
