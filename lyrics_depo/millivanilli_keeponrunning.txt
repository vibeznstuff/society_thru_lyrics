(Ah, look out, get funky)

Keep on running, baby (baby)
(look out, get funky)

(Ah, keep busting)

Elaborate on the microphone
Pumping some knowledge 'cause my brain ain't stoned
At least not in ignorance, contempt or arrogance
I started '82 and I'm fresh ever since
On the microphone I like to talk about what's happened
It's getting all the ladies, it's really not repellent
Wake up back to reality
I'm not into bragging, strutting or bigotry
(Or bigotry, or bigotry, or bigotry, or bigotry)

I get this, you will get dissed
My sister ain't get nothing 'less the woman was pissed
The material thing is what people are looking for
Once they had a taste they want more and more and more (more, more, more)
I tell the truth, yo, sometimes it's sad
But take it light, my brother, beez like dat

Listen to what he says
It's all about today
Time is right

Keep on running, baby (baby)
Keep on running, ba-ba-baby (baby)
(ah, look out, get funky)
Ba ba-ba, ba ba-ba ba-ba (look out, get funky)
Ba ba-ba, ba ba-ba ba-ba...

Listen to what I got to say
Don't go closing your mind, come on, be honest today
Brothers and sisters, aliens or white girl
Believe in yourself so we can make this a nice world
For us to live in so start giving peace and love
Hurry up, the clock is ticking
I tell the truth, yo, sometimes it's sad
Take it light, my brother, beez like dat

Listen to what he says
Time is right

Keep on running, baby (baby)
Keep on running, ba-ba-baby (baby)
(ah, keep busting)
Ba ba-ba, ba ba-ba ba-ba...

(Beez like, be-beez like dat)
(I'm in love with you, girl)
(Be-be-beez like dat)

Keep on, ke-keep on, ke-keep on running, baby (baby)
Keep on running, ba-ba-baby (ba-ba-baby)
Keep on running, ba-ba-baby (baby)
