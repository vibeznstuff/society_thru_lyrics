You got out the wrong side of bed and liked it
The only love you get is unrequited
Morning monday, all week long's not healthy
But being healthy's only for the wealthy

You can't see past the worst case scenario
You'd be happy at this stage if you'd stayed in bed
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile

Wallow in your miserable mess as you tend to
You must stood looking unimpressed, do I offend you?
Morning monday, all week long's not healthy
But being healthy's only for the wealthy

You can't see past the worst case scenario
You'd be happy at this stage if you'd stayed in bed
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile

You can't see past the worst case scenario
You'd be happy at this stage if you'd stayed in bed
You can't see past the worst case scenario
You'd be happy at this stage if you'd stayed in bed

I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile
I pray one day I'll live to see you break a smile
