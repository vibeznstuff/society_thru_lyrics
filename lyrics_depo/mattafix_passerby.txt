She said no words when I chose to stand away...
In the background of my mind when the sun rose I chose the shade...
Never wanted, never needed all the priceless things to say...
But I know that time alone was overdue...I know time alone was overdue, overdue...

At times rock stone is the only bed that's made
So I have the faith come what will,
Come what may...
Passer by in pain

She read those words that I chose to throw her way...
And the times they were laden with hesitation that I made...
And if you're ever my endeavour once again then I'll be changed...
But I know that it ain't so my hope refrains...My hope refrains, rafrains.

At times rock stone is the only bed that's made
So I have the faith come what will,
Come what may...
Passer by in pain

At times rock stone is the only bed that's made
So I have the faith come what will,
Come what may...
And when I rise alone
It don't feel the same
So I have the faith come what will,
Come what may...
Passer by in pain
