I hear your accusations darling,
And my reply is hard to find.
Oh, I wanna know you better.
Won't you consider one more time.
River flow to shining sea,
Mountain nectar blue.
Children flow like waterfalls,
Sweeter love renew.
Peace then war, then peace again.
Trial and error true.
Oh, if you were to visit there,
You would love her too' ooooo!

She's so beautiful.
She's so kind and free.
She's so beautiful.
She's all there is to me.


Tiny planet spins through space,
Gives my life to me.
Fifteen billion human beings,
Where's our destiny?
Peace then war, then peace again.
Trial and error true.
Oh, if you were to come down there,
You would love her too' like I do!

She's so beautiful.
She's so kind and free'yeah!
She's so beautiful.
She's all there is to me.
