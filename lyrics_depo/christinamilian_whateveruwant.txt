Once again it's on
And we gonna ride out
Once again till dawn
Cut the lights out
Once again till morn
Keep the lights out
Till the end of the song


You're feelin' me,
And it's got you all fired up,
Tryin' to walk away
'cause you don't want your heart tied up


But I can feel the proof when you're holdin' me
Like to let you think you're controllin' me,
Even thought that ain't the deal,
When I want I take the wheel, and I know
Can't hide that you're really into me,
Hold is so tight I can barely breathe
'cause you know I keep it real
Giving you what you can feel


Whatever you want I got it,
Whatever you need that's me
Feelin' the flow, don't stop it
Whatever you need I'll be
Whatever you want I got it,
Whatever you need that's me
Feelin' the flow, don't stop it
Whatever you need I'll be


You're frontin' like,
You don't want no one to know
But it's in your eyes
That you don't want me to go






We're gonna get it started, OK
Now go get the party jumpin' like me,
Who crunk it like me,
Lotta of guys here but none is like me
Though some could try to be
With two or three chains up under the white tee
And I got two or three dames that's comin' tonight,

See 'em, done tonight leave,
Like one, aight peace
Only Mike puts up numbers like these,
And he's no longer playing,
But neither am I, so
What I'm saying is hop in the deuce seater with I
'cause you know with them boots
And that beater you fly,
Other dudes act to cheap with the pie,
Won't drop a few pennies,
Or cop you a guinea, but I'll cop you as many,
Toast till the bottles all empty,
Like pardon the Bravado in me
Us two that's a plan somehow,
Get to know each other later,
Let's dance for now, c'mon



Whatever you want I got it,
Whatever you need that's me

Whatever you want I got it,
Whatever you need that... that's me
