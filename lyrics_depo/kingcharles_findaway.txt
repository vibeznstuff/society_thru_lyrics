I know you wanted something fine
I wanted to give you
I know you wanted somewhere
Somewhere you can dream

An I've been thinking bout a time
When you'll be with me you'll be mine
And we will go where we will go
Until there's nothing left to follow

I know we'll find a way
A way to be together
Don't let my love away
This is a storm to weather
If its not fate my baby
Then we will fade away
Come on and lay my lady
I know we'll find a way

Tell me what you know
I can't tell what's on my mind
We've wandered through the city
Let me wander through the wild

Oh, my darling, is there any further to fall?
Time will tell and take away the point of it all

An I've been thinking bout a time
When you'll be with me you'll be mine
And we will go where we will go
Until there's nothing left to follow

I know we'll find a way
A way to be together
Don't let my love away
This is a storm to weather
If its not fate my baby
Then we will fade away
Come on and lay my lady
I know we'll find a way
(Find a way
Find a way
A way to be together)

Where I go
Is where I want my love to follow
I take my time about tomorrow
(Where I go)
Where I wander where I flounder
Will I ever find forever?
(Where I go)
Is where I want my love to follow
(Where I go)
I take my time about tomorrow
(Where I go)
Where I wander where I flounder
Will I ever find forever?

(I know we'll find a way
A way to be together
Don't let my love away
This is a storm to weather
If its not fate my baby
Then we will fade away
Come on and lay my lady
I know we'll find a way)

I know we'll find a way
A way to be together
Don't let my love away
This is a storm to weather
If its not fate my baby
Then we will fade away
Come on and lay my lady
I know we'll find a way

I know we'll find a way

A way to be together

A way to be together

(Find a way
Find a way
A way to be together)
