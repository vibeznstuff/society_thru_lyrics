You aren't allowed to say that you're better
You aren't allowed to say that cause you're the hipster type, the type (whoa oh)
You've got a lot to say, but don't mention
The mirror kissing ways of the hipster type, the type (whoa oh)

You aren't allowed to say anything
We kicked around down water lane
But you're not all, all there
You aren't allowed to say anything
You left me on the street, talking to drains
Cause you're not all, all there

You like to tell yourself that I'm nobody
I think you must have known I'd make you sorry
