You know you've got that thing
That makes the girls all swing
You know exactly what you do
You like the hit and run
You say it's all for fun
You think that I'm the one for you


Boy if you wanna go I would not mind
But I'm not the kind of drum you play one time
Boy if you wanna go I would not mind
But I'm not the kind of drum you play one time
One time, one time, one time
Boy I'm not the kind of drum you play one time
One time, one time, one time
Boy I'm not the kind of drum you play one time

I know I've got that sway
That makes the boys all stay
I know the way that men can be
I like it smooth and slow
Give it some time to grow
That's something you should know about me


Boy if you wanna go I would not mind
But I'm not the kind of drum you play one time
Boy if you wanna go I would not mind
But I'm not the kind of drum you play one time
One time, one time, one time
Boy I'm not the kind of drum you play one time
One time, one time, one time
Boy I'm not the kind of drum you play one time

One more time
Play play the drum

One more time
Play play the drum

One more time
Play play play the drum

One more time


Boy if you wanna go I would not mind
But I'm not the kind of drum you play one time
Boy if you wanna go I would not mind
But I'm not the kind of drum you play one time
One time, one time, one time
Boy I'm not the kind of drum you play one time
One time, one time, one time
Boy I'm not the kind of drum you play one time

One one, one one, one one, one time
One one, one time, one one one, one time
One 
One time
One 
One 
One time

But I'm not the kind of drum you play one time
