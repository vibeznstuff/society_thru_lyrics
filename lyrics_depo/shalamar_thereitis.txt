There it is, there it is
What took us so long to find each other, baby?
There it is, there it is
This time I'm not wrong

But I knew the answer to why people fall in love
But then I found I knew nothing about it
Till I met you, girl, I thought that I had had enough
Now I'm sure I've always been without it

And it feels so good that you and I can go together
Ooh baby, we won't find what we've been looking for
And this time I know we're gonna make it better
Our heart is a key to pump it at the door
Don't have to search no more

There it is, there it is
What took us so long, ooh, to find each other, baby?
There it is, there it is
This time I'm not wrong

In the sea of love we set our sails when waters were up
Two in search of love with no direction
Fish were biting at the time when catching wasn't enough
We couldn't make a sport of our affection

And who could change that we would sail into each other
Ooh girl, I never felt the wave of love so strong
And this love I never felt in any other
I trust it like the light, how this guides the ship to land
I found it when you touched my hand

There it is
What took us so long for a love so strong?
There it is, there it is
This time I'm not wrong

And it's about time
For love to find its way back home
Girl, you're mine
Now that we've found love we've got to get it on

There it is, baby
There it is, this time I'm not wrong
Got a love that's so strong

Like the light, how this guides the ship to land
I found it when you touched my hand

There it is, there it is
What took us so long to find each other, baby?
There it is, there it is
This time I'm not wrong

There it is, hey, what took us so long
To find the sweet, sweet love?
There it is
This time I'm not wrong
This time I'm not wrong
We got a love that's so strong
