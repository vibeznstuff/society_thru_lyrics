We run in circles
That never connect at the same time
Heaven help the lonely ones
As another day older we get, and here we go
Spending our money
Filling the house with things we hope
Will bring us happiness again
And then we cover empty hearts up
With a full smile that has no joy
Lying for love, were dying for more
Well you can have anything these days I'm sure

Making your mind up
It never did anyone no good
For how do you touch what you cant have
You cover the hurt
Pretend you don't care
Its living I guess but it hardly compares

Gimme some time
Lend me a hand
Reach into the dark and you'll understand
Only the lonely know
Would you go anywhere
Do anything
Falling so low that you see
What the lonely know

Hiding your poor heart
You wouldn't think could be so hard
From the roaring giant of love
Oh but he wont leave
And so you keep silently screaming
Filling your head with a love song
That no-one will ever want
And yes we are keeping up resistance
To a good time in case we fall
Put up a wall you cant overcome
Well I believe every home should have one

Fortunes, persistence
It never did anyone no good
When a taste is worse than none at all
It opens the hurt
Makes you so scared
I see a world that is empty out there

Gimme some time
Lend me a hand
Reach into the dark and you'll understand
Only the lonely know
Would you go anywhere
Do anything
Falling so low that you see
What the lonely know

We cover our empty hearts up
With a full smile
But it has no joy
Put up a wall you cant overcome
To cover the hurt
Pretend you don't care
I see a world that is empty out there

Gimme some time
Lend me a hand
Reach into the dark and you'll understand
Only the lonely know
Would you go anywhere
Do anything
Falling so low that you see
What the lonely know
Only the lonely know
