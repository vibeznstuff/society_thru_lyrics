Looking at me through the eye of a needle
is a scary thing to do
I feel a mole hill lies in front of me to climb
Is your primary purpose in life
to scrutinize every move I make
cos if it is I think your wasting precious time

Well I know that I have got a job to do
And I know, that my job is pleasing you, but

I am what I am
The way god made me
I am what I am
Don't try and change me

Well I know I have my weaknessess
as you point them out to me
but our confont the spots of doubt as they arise
Never born to be a leader
but I'll take my role with pride
cos a soldier with his honours lies inside

Well I know that I have got a job to do
As you say, that my job revolves around you
I am what I am
The way god made me
I am what I am
Don't try and change me

Well I know that I have got a job to do
But my life, wasn't made:for you

I am what I am
The way god made me
I am what I am
Don't try and change me

I am what I am
The way god made me
