We're giving up on all the emptiness
I fill it up with your sweet love beside me
Ain't no fun to be a rolling stone inside
You buy the feeling and then you pay with tears
For what it matters you go with the motion
Then out of nowhere there's a full moon rising
And it's mine
And every, every moment is the history we make and more
We got a legacy of understanding, I
Can love you better but don't let your
Heart stop beating in time
Don't take me below the danger level
Caught up in the middle of a misery
Don't let me die
And I warn you if you let your
Heart stop beating in time
Don't make it a fatal combination
I won't ever find another your love like yours, no, no
Got to get closer, got to be in sight
You make it heaven to breathe with you woman
Don't you get lonely in the midnight hour like me
And there's an angel that I follow on the wind, and more
Within a universe of undiscovered eyes
We found each other so don't let your
Heart stop beating in time
Don't take me below the danger level
Caught up in the middle of a misery
Oh baby don't let it be
Save my soul
I don't wanna be no chains that hold
Gotta be a wild new world out
There is a plan
I don't wanna be no one night stand
Gonna be alive for you
Now here is the love
I can hold it in my hand
Can you feel it
I'm nothing if you let your
Heart stop beating in time
Don't take me below the danger level
Caught up in the middle of this misery
Don't let me down
If you let your heart stop beating in time
You're making a fatal combination
I wont' ever find another love like yours
Don't let me down
Don't let your heart stop beating in time
Don't take me below the danger level
Living in the middle of this misery
Don't let it die
