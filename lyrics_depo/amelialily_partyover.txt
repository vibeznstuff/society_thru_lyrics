Tell me is the party over, over over, yeah
Is the party over, over over, yeah

It's not enough, tell me is the party over, over over, yeah
Is the party over, over over, yeah

So it's over, wishing the stars wont fade tonight
Hold me closer, tomorrow's another day to find

I said it once, and ill say it again
Oh you know, you know
I got a feeling that this is the end
Oh nooo

Tell me is the party over, over over, yeah
Is the party over, over over, yeah
Tell me is the party over, over over, yeah
Is the party over, over over, yeah
Are we getting colder, colder, yeah

If you wanna love me sometime
I'm not gonna give my love
If you're gonna give me nothing
Then maybe this love is better off lost
If you wanna love me sometime
I'm not gonna give my love
If you're gonna give me nothing
Then maybe this love is better off lost

So it's over, wishing the stars wont fade tonight
So much stronger, but memories of you still survive

Nothing lasts
Nothing lasts

I said it once, and ill say it again
Oh you know, you know
I got a feeling that this is the end
Oh nooo

Tell me is the party over, over over, yeah
Is the party over, over over, yeah
Tell me is the party over, over over, yeah
Is the party over, over over, yeah
Are we getting colder, colder, yeah

Is it over, nothing lasts
Is it over, nothing lasts
Nothing lasts
