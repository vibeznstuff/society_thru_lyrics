No matter gay or grim, it's those tiny little sparks
Daily life that makes me forget my wounded heart
It doesn't matter when, it may rain or it may shine
blurry memories of us come back from time to time


No matter gay or grim, it's those tiny little sparks
Daily life that makes me forget my sulky heart
It doesn't matter when, it may rain or it may shine
You will always be here stored inside my mind

Come I'll give you all my love
Suck some air
Tell you what I'm dreaming of
Oh, whoa, oh....

Maybe within a thousand years
You'll be here
Maybe within a thousand tears
Oh, whoa, oh.....

Whoa, whoa....oh, oh

Can I be so alone?
Can I be so alone?

Hmm....

Oh, oh....whoa, oh, oh......

La la la la la la...hmm.....
