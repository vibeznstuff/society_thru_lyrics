Oh my heart is spinning like a wheel,
Only she can see the way that I fell,
Eyes are holding right across the room,
High explosion coming out of the blue;

Well here we go again,
Living in a world that others cannot share,
Yea here we go again,
We are moving from a spark to a flame;

I am high on emotion, high again,
High on emotion, your love will find the way;

Oh my heart is burning like a fire,
Closer now and she is breathing desire,
Take my hand and give it all your light,
Take command I am your rhythm tonight;

Well here we go again,
Living in a world that others cannot share,
Yea here we go again,
We are moving from a spark to a flame;

I am high on emotion, high again,
High on emotion, your love will find the way;

I am high on emotion, high again,
High on emotion, your love will find the way;
High on emotion, high again,
High on emotion, your love will find the way.
