This is for my future baby mama
Hope your skin as black as midnight
I'll take you out that Honda
I can put you in a Benz, I can balance out your chakras
Fornication is a sin, we can fuck all night regardless
Oh father, oh the heavens, as I pray for new McLarens
Pray the police don't blow me down cause of my complexion
Everybody think they know me now
Cause I'm chicken-checkin'
Negro, you are not my homie
How dare you thinks it's different
Boy, you trippin'

Gas break, I dipped
The cash came, I flipped
I stack that, yeah I stack that past the ceiling
So sacrilegious, don't ask to chat
And don't ask for bitches, bagbak I'm trippin'
Bag-bagbak, bagbak you don't know me better
Bag-bagbak, bagbak you don't know me better
Bag-bagbak, bagbak you don't know me homie

Boy oh boy and we are
Floating on the Dions
Go until they take my bro and em out them city CRs
Prison system broken
Racial war commercin'
Until the president get that, shit Vincent won't be votin'
We need Tomika's and Shaniqua's in that Oval Office
Obama ain't enough for me, we only getting started
The next Bill Gates can be on Section 8 up in the projects
So today, love my dark skin
Bitch I'm goin' all in

Gas break, I dipped
The cash came, I flipped
I stack that, yeah I stack that past the ceiling
So sacrilegious, don't ask to chat
And don't ask for bitches, bagbak I'm trippin'
Bag-bagbak, bagbak you don't know me better
Bag-bagbak, bagbak you don't know me better
Bag-bagbak, bagbak you don't know me homie

They found it
Death close to 3, 230 feet
A deep dive, but within acceptable range

Clap your hands if the police ever profile
You don't gotta worry, don't be scared because we own ya
Ain't no gentrifying us, we finna buy the whole town
Tell the one percent to suck a dick, because we on now
We on now, we on now
Tell the one percent to suck a dick, because we on now
Tell the government to suck a dick, because we on now
Tell the president to suck a dick, because we on now
We on now
We on now
We on now
We on now
