I feel the tremors, rumors of war
Upon the surface of my door
And I got no place to call my country
I got no place to call my country, anymore

I don't have the tools to deal with this
I don't have the drugs
And I got no place to call my country
I got no place to have my love, anymore

Yeah, when the bomb went off
We were dancing in the kitchen with a neon cross
Yeah, baby I'm lost
Never saw it coming, never thought I'd wake up
With no place to call my country
I got no place to call my country, my country

I know everyone of us are hypocrites
But still I never thought that it would come to this
No place to love, no place to exist
I got no place to raise my kids
All of my reserves are compromised
And you can punch a hole in all my alibis
I know that I'm wrong, but you don't know you're blind
Do you see me? Do you see me at night?

And yeah when the bomb went off
We were dancing in our kitchen with a neon cross
Yeah, baby I'm lost
Never saw it coming, never thought I'd wake up
With no place to call my country
I got no place to call my country, my country
No place to call my country

I feel the tremors and rumors of war
Up on the surface of my door
(No place to call my home)
(No place to call my home)

And yeah when the bomb went off
We were dancing in our kitchen with a neon cross
Yeah when the call came back
I was standing in the shadow of a panic attack
Yeah, I don't know where I'm at
I never saw it coming, never thought I'd wake up
With no place to call my country
I got no place to call my country
(No place to call my home)
My country
No place to call my country, my home
(No place to call my home)
My home
(No place to call my home)
(No place to call my home)
(No place to call my home)
(No place to call my home)
