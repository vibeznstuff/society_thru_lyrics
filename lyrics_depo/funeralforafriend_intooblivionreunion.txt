The days I've felt alone
And the sea, it brings me back again
So that I can see my wife
And I can see my child
Home, I'm home, it never changes
Same old faces, same old places

I stared into oblivion
And found my own
I stared into oblivion
Into oblivion

Find in me the hope
That you have never known
Find in us the faith
The faith to bring you home

I stared into oblivion
And found my own
I stared into oblivion
And found my own
I stared into oblivion
And found my own reflection there (reflection there)

Home, now that I'm coming home
Will you be the same as when I saw you last?
Tell me how much time has passed
Home, now that I'm coming home
Will you be the same as when I saw you last?
Tell me how much time has passed
Home, now that I'm coming home
Will you be the same as when I saw you last?
Tell me how much time has passed

I stared into oblivion
(And found my own)
I stared into oblivion
(And found my own)
I stared into oblivion
(And found my own)
I stared into oblivion
And found my own reflection there
