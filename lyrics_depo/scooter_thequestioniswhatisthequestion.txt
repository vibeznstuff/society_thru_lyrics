Just me and you

Start the danger
Rearranger
Not so cool
Mercy
I'm the vapour
On the radar
Get up on the mic and shout it

I spit bricks got the kicks in the mix
My pricks long out the rigs
Party of bricks like Jackie X
No diggedy diggedy HP
I'm the bad boy, roll MC, so sexy

How do you do, uh huh
I thought why not na na, na na
Just me and you
And then we can na na, na na
Just like before
And you will say na na, na na
Please give me more and you

Won't let you go
Me got the flow
Mash up the show
Shalak
K nami nama
Like a hammer
A burning candle
Fixed up with the spanner
Move it
I slip chips
Rapping in da mix
Wanna see your xxxx
Spit, kicks
For da hits
With the lyrical tricks
No diggedy diggedy diggedy, listen
Got a late night - early morning mission
