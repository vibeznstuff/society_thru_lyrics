Don't forget to remember me
Don't forget (get get) to remember me 
Please keep me in your heart

Don't forget (get get) to remember me


Ey the king modern day Martin Luther, Malcom X
I'm officially the freshest don't dare forget
I'm gone, momentarily don't bury me yet
Like Ali got I got title back prepare for that
When the world needed tip
Ask where he was it
But where he need something back
*** fade to black
Talking *** behind his back
You a hater for that
I'm don't expect nothing less
In the game with chess you think 5 moves ahead and not behind
Niggas jumped up cheered when I got my time
Like yeah, one whole year I got in the grind
But get me losing off your mind
Shorty may I remind you
That there ain't another *** who done been through what I been through
Time after time again you better get some ? in you
When you said it was over for him and you thought he couldn't continue to floss
Here's to your memory loss
Sucker


Don't forget (get get) to remember me 
Please keep me in your heart
If we ever have to part
Don't forget forget to remember me


They say out of sight is out of mind
And 9 times out of 10 me and out of pocket out of line
You do it big everybody that you out shined
Then your old lady fate talk about how she got fine
She say she trying to get away
He say about time
Right now we all thinking damn hope it not mine
But when its lights out for you and you locked down
Ain't not telling whether or not your lady when and got down
With that nigga cross town? Town cause he hot now
Ripping up your love letters, lifting up her night gown
Right now somebody baby momma gettin piped down
Kids in the next room listening, I'm gonna pipe down
The thought hurt don't it
But maybe she strong enough for ain't get that lonely cause you wasn't gone long enough
True
Its just a temporarily setback
Its on when I get back
Please don't forget that


Don't forget to remember me
Don't forget (please don't) to remember me
Please keep me in your heart
If we ever have to part
Don't forget (get get) to remember me


I don't mean to feel like this
Don't mean to think like this
My heart just has to be shown
That the love that I give to you
That's the love that I get from you
I need to be safe and secure
Don't forget don't forget to remember me
Please remember me
Everything I bring to this love love
Please keep me in your heart
If we ever have to part
Don't forget (get) to remember me

Don't you... forget about me
