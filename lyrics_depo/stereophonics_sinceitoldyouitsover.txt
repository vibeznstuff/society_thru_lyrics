Black and blue from the wind and the rain 
Said I'm sorry for the lies and the pain 
I never ever meant to make you cry 
If I could take you back, you know, I would, 
I wanna burn up and die 

So take a look at me now 
Since I told you it's over 
You got a hole in your heart 
I'll find a four leaf clover 
You can't tell me this now 
This far down the line 
That you're never, ever gonna get over me 

You've seen a cross, it's a cross I bear 
You're drinking, hard up, living without a hope or a care 
You're making do to please, see what makes you smile 
You're not around for long, you gotta see what's gonna move your life right along 

So take a look at me now 
Since I told you it's over 
You got a hole in your heart 
I'll find a four leaf clover 
You can't tell me this now 
This far down the line 
That you're never, ever gonna get over me 

I'm lost 
I'm cold 
I'm getting old 
My head is filled with lies I told 

I've been down 
I've been around 
But I've fallen on my own two feet 
And I've left you out to drown 
I never meant for that 

I look around, sometimes I stare 
I think back now and then, I hope you know I care 
I walked away that day, trying to treat you right 
But you were on your track, it was me turning back, I left you freezing outside 

So take a look at me now 
Since I told you it's over 
You got a hole in your heart 
I'll find a four leaf clover 
You can't tell me this now 
This far down the line 
That you're never, ever gonna get over me 
Never get over me 
Never get over me 

But you were on your track, it was me turning back, I left you freezing outside 

So take a look at me now 
Since I told you it's over 
You got a hole in your heart 
I'll find a four leaf clover 
You can't tell me this now 
This far down the line
