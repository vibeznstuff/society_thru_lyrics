You got me tied down with battleship chains  
fifty foot long and a two ton anchor
tied down with battleship chains
fifty foot long with a two ton anchor

I can't move my arms 
to hold nobody
hold nobody but you 
I can't move my legs s
to chase nobody
to kick nobody but you

You got me tied down with battleship chains
fifty foot long and a two ton anchor
tied down with battleship chains
fifty foot long and a two ton anchor

I can't move eyes
to see nobody
see nobody but you
I can't move my tongue
to taste nobody
to lick nobody but you

You got me tied down with battleship chains
fifty foot long and a two ton anchor
tied down with battleship chains
fifty foot long and a two ton anchor

I can't move my lips
to kiss nobody
kiss nobody but you
I can't move my heart 
to love nobody
to love nobody but you

You got me tied down with battleship chains
fifty foot long and a two ton anchor
tied down with battleship chains    
fifty foot long and a two ton anchor  
You got me tied, tied,   
whoo hoo, tied tied
don't you know you got me 
tied tied, whoo hoo  
baby don't you know you got me 
tied tied, whoo hoo
