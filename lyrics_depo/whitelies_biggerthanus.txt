You took the tunnel route home.
You'd never taken that way with me before.
Did you feel a need for change?
Apologies on your fingernails,
Love flickered in the city of lights
Like intermittent radio waves.

I don't need your tears
I don't want your love
I've just got to get home.

And I feel like I'm breaking up
But I wanted to stay.
Headlights on the hillside
Don't take me this way.
I don't want you to hold me
I want you to pray,
'cause it's bigger than us.

You went where the horses cry
You'd never taken that way with me before.
Did you feel a need for a change?
Guilt smeared across your lips
I was tired and cold from the window.
You're tired nothing has changed.

I don't need your tears
I don't want your love
I've just got to get home.

And I feel like I'm breaking up
But I wanted to stay.
Headlights on the hillside
Don't take me this way.
I don't want you to hold me
I want you to pray,
'cause it's bigger than us.
