I owe you one
You made my day with the way you gave love
I owe you one (I owe you one)
I'll stay deep in debt 'cos I'll never get enough

But when it's time to collect
Girl, you can bet I'll remember
The way you made me feel
(Late at night) you showed me love was real (oh, so real)
(Hey! I wanna do for you what you did for me)
You gave me your love ever so (tenderly)

I owe you one
You've only to ask me there's nothing I wouldn't do-oo
I owe you one (I owe you one)
Just when I needed you girl you came through

And baby you never asked if my credit was good
You just gave me love like you understood
(I returned the love) and you knew I would
(I can't help myself)

I wanna do for you what you did for me
You gave me your love ever so (tenderly)
And easy (ooh ooh)

I owe you one - ooh ooh
I owe you one - aaah aah
Aaah aah aah I'll pay you back baby aaah aah aah
Aaah aah aah I'll pay you back baby
(I owe you one)
I owe you one
I owe you one
(I owe you one)

I-I owe you one

And when it's time to collect
Girl, you can bet I'll remember
The way you made me feel
(Late at night) you showed me love was real (oh, so real)
(Hey! I wanna do for you what you did for me)

I owe you one
I owe you one
