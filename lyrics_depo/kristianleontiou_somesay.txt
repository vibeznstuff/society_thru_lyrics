No more trouble in my soul
No more time to make me whole
So today I try to tell you 
I'll be on my way

Show me where the answers lives
Show me where the truth forgives
In my head I've tried to reason
I'll be on my way

Some say, the road is clear
Some say, confront your fears
Some say, but can you feel the love that do?

Why do people always change?
When memories aways stay the same
In my head I've tryed to reason
I'll be on my way

Some say, the road is clear
Some say, confront your fears
Some say, but can you feel the love that do?

One day we will be free, under the summer sun
And you will see
One day we will be free, under the summer sun
And you will see

Some say, the road is clear
Some say, confront your fears
Some say, but can you feel the love that do?

Can you feel the love
Can you feel the love
Can you feel the love
Can you feel the love that I do?

Can you feel the love
Can you feel the love
Can you feel the love
Can you feel the love that I do?

Can you feel the love that I do?
