Cold and lonely, tired and bored
Just like the day before
Missing out on life's reward
Of that you can be sure

So bring on the dancing girls
Take off the cold night and the sad day
Bring on the dancing girls
Take off the twilight and the skies so grey

And they dance for him inside his head

Soul destroyed by life's demands
With nothing to believe
Our hero sits with head in hands
And heart upon his sleeve

So bring on the dancing girls
Take off the cold night and the sad day
Bring on the dancing girls
Bring on the girls to dance his blues away

And they danced for him inside his head

Dancing girls
Take off the cold night and the sad day
Bring on the dancing girls
Bring on the girls to dance his blues away
