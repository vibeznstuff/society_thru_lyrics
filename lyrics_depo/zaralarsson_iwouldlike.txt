I didn't know that I could want you so deep
Until I saw you with someone who's not me
You've got me playing in a game that ain't fair
But you're taking me there, yeah you're taking me there

Oh, I can't help myself, it's human nature, human nature
Who's to say what's meant to be?
Oh, why can't we be on our worst behaviour, worst behaviour
When it comes so naturally

I would like, to get, to know you baby
Like to get, under your sexy body
I would like, to get, to know you baby
Like to get, under your sexy body

Woah, woah-oah-oah
(Under your sexy body)
Oh
Under your sexy body
Oh
Under your sexy body

Know what you're doing when you hold her like that (like that)
Looking at me to see if I'm looking back
But me and you both know where tonight is gon' lead (gon' lead)
Cause you're leaving with me (leaving with me)
You're leaving with me, yeah yeah

Oh, I can't help myself, it's human nature, human nature
Who's to say what's meant to be?
(Who's to say what's meant to be?)
Why can't we be on our worst behaviour, worst behaviour
When it all comes so naturally

I would like to get, to know you baby
Like to get, under your sexy body
I would like to get, to know you baby
Like to get, under your sexy body

(Under your sexy body), na na na, na na na
Under your sexy body
I would like to get, to know you baby
Like to get, under your sexy body

Come take me under now, na na na, na na na
Don't want to go without, na na na, na na na (don't wanna go)
Come take me under now, na na na, na na na
Don't want to go without, na na na, na na na

I would like, to get, to know you baby
Like to get, under your sexy body
I would like, to get, to know you baby
Like to get, under your sexy body
