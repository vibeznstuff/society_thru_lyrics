I don't know where I crossed the line 
Was it something that I said 
Or didn't say this time 
And I don't know if it's me or you 
But I can see the skies are changing 
In all the shades of blue 
And I don't know which way it's gonna go 

If it's gonna be a rainy day 
There's nothing we can do to make it change 
We can pray for sunny weather 
But that won't stop the rain 
Feeling like you got no place to run 
I can be your shelter 'til it's done 
We can make this last forever 
So please don't stop the rain 

(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall) 
Please don't stop the rain 
(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall) 
Please don't stop the rain 

I thought that time was on our side 
I've put in far too many years 
To let this pass us by 
You see live is a crazy thing 
There'll be good time and there'll be bad times 
And everything in between 
And I don't know which way it's gonna go 

If it's gonna be a rainy day 
There's nothing we can do to make it change 
We can pray for sunny weather 
But that won't stop the rain 
Feeling like you got no place to run 
I can be your shelter 'til it's done 
We can make this last forever 
So please don't stop the rain 

(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall) 
Please don't stop the rain 
(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall) 
Please don't stop the rain 

Oh we'rea little closer now 
And finally what life's it's all about 
Yeah I know you just can't stand it 
If things don't go your way 
But we've got no control over what happens anyway 

If it's gonna be a rainy day 
There's nothing we can do to make it change 
We can pray for sunny weather 
But that won't stop the rain 
Feeling like you got no place to run 
I can be your shelter 'til it's done 
We can make this last forever 
So please don't stop the rain 

(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall) 
Please don't stop the rain 
(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall) 
Please don't stop the rain 

(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall) 
Can't stop it, can't stop it, just can't stop the rain 
(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall) 
Let it fall, please don't stop the rain
