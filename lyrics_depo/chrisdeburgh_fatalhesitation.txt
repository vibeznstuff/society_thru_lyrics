The cafe's are all deserted
The streets are wet again
There's nothing quite like
An out of season holiday town in the rain
When the tourists go
And the cold winds blow
And my girl is on a plane
Home

I'm never gonna love another
The way I have loved you
It's taken me a little time to discover
Now I know it's true
But fatal hesitation
Made me miss the show

Ooooooh, Romeo is standing in the rain
And I know that I have let her slip away
Fatal hesitation, fatal hesitation

I saw you again this morning
Walking down the beach
And though you are a thousand miles away
You were only just out of reach
When I got up close and I saw her face
I knew it couldn't be so
No, nooooooo

Ooooooh, Romeo is standing in the rain
And I know that I have let her slip away
Fatal hesitation, fatal hesitation

I'm gonna get on my boat and sail away

Ooooooh, Romeo is standing in the rain
And I know that I have let her slip away
Fatal hesitation, fatal hesitation

I'm gonna read a little Shakespeare
And get her outta my head
It doesn't matter anymore

Gonna miss her just a little bit
Just a little bit
