Na na niiiii
Morning star
Your my morning star, star, star, star
Your my morning star your the one that I love shine so far
The one that I'm waiting for
Woah woah


You got me wishing on a star
When I can be where you are
I'm hoping that I'll see you soon
Before you travel to far
Don't go, don't go I just got a chance to know you
Don't go, don't go there's still so much more I could show you

Your my morning star
I wanna be wherever ever that you are
Cause you shine shine your light straight through my heart
Straight through the dark
Straight through the dark
Your my morning star


You got me wishing on a star
When I can be where you are
I'm hoping that I'll see you soon
Before you travel to far
Don't go, don't go I just got a chance to know you
Don't go, don't go there's still so much more I could show you

Ah you go me wishing on a star
Thought we never be apart
From down here your way too far
Want you with me on my journey
Like you've been here from the start
We don't wanna be anywhere without you
This ent like the other times you've been lied to
Where would I be if I was without you
I couldn't be able to if I tried to


You got me wishing on a star
When I can be where you are
I'm hoping that I'll see you soon
Before you travel to far
Don't go, don't go I just got a chance to know you
Don't go, don't go there's still so much more I could show you

Don't go, don't go I just got a chance to know you
Don't go, don't go there's still so much more I could show you
