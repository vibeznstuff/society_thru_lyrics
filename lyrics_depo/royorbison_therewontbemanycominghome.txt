Listen all you people 
Try and understand 
You may be a soldier 
Woman, child or man 

But there won't be many coming home 
No, there won't be many coming home 
Oh, there won't be many 
Maybe ten out of twenty 
But there won't be many coming home 

Now the old folks will remember 
On that dark and dismal day 
How their hearts were choked with pride 
As their children marched away 
Now the glory is all gone 
They are left alone 

And there won't be many coming home 
No, there won't be many coming home 
Oh, there won't be many 
Maybe five out of twenty 
But there won't be many coming home 

Look real closely at the soldier 
Coming at you through the haze 
He may be the younger brother who ran away 
And before you kill another 
Listen to what I say 

Oh, there won't be many coming home 
Oh, there won't be many coming home 
Oh, there won't be many 
There may not be any 
But there won't be many coming home 

If they all came back but one 
He was still some mother's son 
And there won't be many coming home 

Oh, there won't be many coming home 
Oh, there won't be many coming home 
Oh, there won't be many coming home...
