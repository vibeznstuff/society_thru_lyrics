We don't need no bed
I know we can touch the pictures for it
Many places in my head
I'm gonna make sure that you never forget
You know you've been chosen
There's a privilege deep inside the moment
And you don't have to stress up baby
Just follow me cos you know

At the end of the night (the night)
You know I'mma show up because I wanna show up
I'mma take you away from here
No need for discussions, girl no interruptions

Cos I know we gonna take it there tonight (there tonight)
Cos I know we gonna take it there tonight (there tonight)
I know we gonna take it there tonight (there tonight)
Cos I know we gonna take it there tonight (there tonight)

I know you wanna look your best baby
But really it don't matter what you're wearing
Cos I'm already impressed
You can do no wrong that's what I'm yelling
You know you've been chosen
There's a privilege deep inside the moment
So baby open up to me
The world is yours come get it

At the end of the night (the night)
You know I'mma show up because I wanna show up
I'mma take you away from here
No need for discussions, girl no interruptions

Cos I know we gonna take it there tonight (there tonight)
Cos I know we gonna take it there tonight (there tonight)
I know we gonna take it there tonight (there tonight)
Cos I know we gonna take it there tonight (there tonight)

You know at the end (end, end, end)
You know I will show up because I wanna show up
I'mma take (take, take, take)
No need for discussions, girl no interruptions
I know we gonna take it there tonight (there tonight)
Cos I know we gonna take it there tonight (there tonight)
