Old man
Your race is run
You think it's over
It's only begun
Child is born
Who has to face
The world you're leaving
A dangerous place

Listen To The Voices
Crying to be free
Can we be the promise that we promised to be
Love and understanding
Are better than a war
People just laughing 'cause they've heard it before

Night chills
In Plenty town
Cardboard hotels
They sleep on the ground
Hard choices
How to respond
Red or rosé
With the Duck à l'orange

Listen To The Voices
So easy to ignore
Choruses of old folk scared to open the door
Living in the shadows
And dying in the cold
Inner city jungle ain't no place to grow old

Helpless
We'll never be
Though justice
Is so hard to see
Kindness, yes
That same old song
But don't stop singing
There's so much strength in kindness

Listen To The Voices - Crying to be free
Crying to be free - Can we be the promise
Can we be the promise - That we promised to be
Love and understanding - Better than a war
Are better than a war - People just laughing
People just laughing 'cause they've heard it before

Listen To The Voices
Crying to be free
Can we be the promise that we promised to be

Listen To The Voices - Listen To The Voices
Crying to be free - Crying to be free
Can we be the promise - Can we be the promise
That we promised to be
Love and understanding - Love and understanding
Are better than a war - Better than a war
People just laughing
People just laughing 'cause they've heard it before
