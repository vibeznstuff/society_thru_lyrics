When I'm with you baby
I go out of my head

(I just can't get enough,)
(I just can't get enough)

All the things you do to me 
And everything you said

(I just can't get enough,
Just can't get enough)

We slip and slide as we fall in love,
And I just can't seem to get enough oohh



We walk together,
We're walking down the street

(I just can't get enough,)
(I just can't get enough)

Everytime I think of you 
I know we have to meet

(I just can't get enough,)
(I just can't get enough}
