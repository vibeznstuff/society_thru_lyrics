Boy this evening was it only me
Feeling completly down to be open
Down to be open for some satisfaction
Didn't want to say yes, afraid of your reaction
I knew it was wrong, for feeling this way
Especially the thought of givin' in on the first date
Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night I had to decide, I was thinkin'...

I should make a move but I won't
I know your probly thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

I should make a move but I won't
I know your probly thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night


We were chillin' watching your T.V.
I felt it was comin' the closer that you got to me
Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you
And some how in one night, discover I love you
Felt so right, but it felt so wrong
And look how we're carryin' on
Tryin' to say things to get me to stay
But my watch is telling me it's getting to late, I'm thinkin'...

I should make a move but I won't
I know your probly thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

If you, want me, you got to know me
And if you want my love (My love) you gotta wait my love
Ba Baby that's the way its got to be
Get to know me (Get to know me) so we can do this, Oooohhh

I should 
I know your probably thinkin' 
(I want I want babe)
Knowin' if I do  (I want I want babe)
I don't get down, on the first night

I should make a move, but I won't
I know your probably thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night
