You got the socket
And I got the plug
I am the floor
And you are the rug

I got the rhythm
You got the beat
We feel it shake us 
From our souls to our feet

And you know I love you
You know I love you... don't you

You got the metal
And I got the die
We make a structure
That no one can deny

I need you
And you need me
I need your honey
Like a flower needs a bee

And you know I love you
You know I love you... don't you

No one is an island
On that you can depend 
A vessel on his own
Is a sinking ship
It will be that way
'Til the time will end

Now don't you worry
When the thing get tough
We'll stick together
Through the smooth and the rough

You're the steam engine
And I am the tracks
Roll over me 
I'll be rolling right back 'cause

You know I love you
You know I love you... don't you
