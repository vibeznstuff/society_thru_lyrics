I've had a bad day, yeah.
My hometown is falling down, I'm mad about that.
And people there don't seem to care, I'm mad about that.

Good god, all my tears
There's no denying life
Would be better if I never ever had to live with you,
Blue - it's a colour so cruel


Government has got me wrong, I'm mad about that.
And it makes me feel like I don't belong, I'm mad about that.
It's making life a misery, you would have taken the liberty
Government has got me wrong, I'm mad about that.

Good god, all my tears
There's no denying life
Would be better if I never ever had to live with you,
Blue - it's a colour so cruel


There you go telling lies, it's no surprise
I say a prayer, to make you care,
You wouldn't listen
It's been too long, it's time you're gone
Get away from here
I've had too much - but not enough
It's time you left

Good god, all my tears
There's no denying life
Would be better if I never ever had to live with you,
Blue - it's a colour so cruel
