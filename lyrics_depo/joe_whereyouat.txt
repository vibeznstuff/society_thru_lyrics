Where you at
Where you at
Where you at
Baby where you at
Baby where you at
Baby where you at
Baby where you at


Every word I cut you down is playing in my head
Like a scar face crime scene ain't no bringing it back
Those tears didn't mean much to bun now I know
That you said you didn't feel it to the wind starts to get cold


Only she's the woman like the car I replaced it
No sleep I wonder if she saw this bullet coming like this
Only words that I can hear in my ear is the gesture your gon' the seeds
You planted in the fields
Baby where you at when you sitting on my pillow case no more
Baby where you at I just recognized I'm living life alone
Baby where you at I just wish just wish you'd call me
Damn this phone baby where you at
Doc said I only got four weeks my whole life just flashed before me


Oh, oh, ohhhaaa (how foolish could I be)
Wild as can be
Never (never) fear be humble (humble)
Got me out to face my fate
May never have a choice to be honest (honest) with the one that was loyal to me
God really has his ways of taken you off that stage




Yea Papoose, Pap, Papoose
They say you never know what you have till you lose it
You promise your girl something you better do it
You can't tell a woman you love her are you stupid
Words don't express you love you got to prove it
Back then our relationship wasn't the truest
Grown man slow dance to Joe music
As the time went on I become foolish
Now your gone everything ruined
But girl this is Papoose I'm on your favorite track
I know your friends are in your ear
But baby come back and I never let you down so later for that
I told you I was gonna make it I was the savior of rap
And I work hard you don't got to cater to Pap
I tie my own do-rag
Lay back and relax
You don't even got to accept my apology
But I'm man enough to admit it acknowledge me


Awhooo babe
If anyone up in here wasn't just like me
Awhooo babe
Treat her like this wasn't last week
Wont you call babe (wont you call)
No this song babe
Girl you know this song is hearing me
Damn I regret when I almost pass me


Baby where you at when you sitting on my pillow case no more
Baby where you at I just recognized I'm living life alone
Baby where you at I just wish just wish you'd call me
Damn this phone baby where you at
Doc said I only got four weeks my whole life just past before me
