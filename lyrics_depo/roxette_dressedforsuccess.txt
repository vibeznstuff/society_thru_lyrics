Tried to make it little by little,
tried to make it bit by bit on my own.
Quit the job, the grey believers,
another town where I get close to the bone.
Whatcha gonna tell your brother? - oh oh oh
whatcha gonna tell your father? - I don't know!
Whatcha gonna tell your mother? - Let me go...

I'm gonna get dressed for success
shaping me up for the big time, baby.
Get dressed for success
shaping it up for your love yea yea yea.

I'm not afraid, a trembling flower,
I'll feed your heart and blow the dust from your eyes
and in the dark things happen faster.
I love the way you sway your hips next to mine.
Whatcha gonna tell your brother? - oh oh oh
whatcha gonna tell your father? - I don't know!
Whatcha gonna tell your mother? - Let me go...

I'm gonna get dressed for success,
hitting a spot for the big time, baby.
Get dressed for success
shaping it up for your love.

Look sharp!
