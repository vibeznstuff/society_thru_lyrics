I never understand what you do to me, 
But I'll never get right down on bended knee, 
But I cry and I cry and I cry 

I don't think you know you've done me wrong, 
But still I've been in love now oh so long 
But I try and I try and I try, 
and you don't believe me 

I give you my house, my heart, my home, 
When I'm gone you're not alone 
You never hear a thing I say, 
And it happens every day 

Why, why, why, why, why, why are you never home? 
While I, I, I, I, I, sit here by the phone 
'Cause I try and I try and I try, 
and you don't believe me 

Oh lord, I give you my house, my heart, my home, 
When I'm gone you're not alone 
You never hear a thing I say, 
And it happens every day 

Why, why, why, why, why, why are you never home? 
While I, I, I, I, I, sit here by the phone 
'Cause I try and I try and I try, 
and you don't believe me 
Well I try and I try and I try, 
and you don't believe me 
Well I try and I try and I try, 
and you don't believe me
