Ah, ah, ah, ah
Hey son, I'm looking forward
You're leaning backwards of this I'm sure
Have you had enough? Are you feeling rough?
Does your skull hurt? Well if it's warm
Cause I am taking back what's mine, I am taking back the time
You may call it suicide but I'm being born again, I'm waiting
Ah, I'm waiting, ah, right here now, I'm waiting
For someone or something to take me, to take me over

Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over simply forgotten, how to disappear

Home bred, I've got blood lust
Feeding you bread crust, I leave no scar
You say I'm old hat, a fucking dirty rat
Call me a cliche how right you are
Cause I am flipping bag of bones, I am righting all your wrongs
You may call it suicide but I'm being born again, I'm waiting
Ah, I'm waiting, ah, right here now, I'm waiting
For someone or something to take me to take me over

Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over simply forgotten, how to disappear
Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over simply forgotten, how to disappear
I saw something, I get on the dark, it's the
You was at home chewing on monkey brains
I am not here, I'm just a silhouette
You will never ever ever forget
Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over simply forgotten, how to disappear
Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over simply forgotten, how to disappear
I saw something, I get on the dark, it's the
You was at home chewing on monkey brains
