Stepping outside my head
I don’t wanna hear what you said
I don’t wanna fall down flights of stairs
Tripwires everywhere
I’m climbing trying to get from under you
If you ask me back I’ll go, I need distraction
So pull every pin from every grenade
And blow it all up in my face

Make everything louder, do it till my skin vibrates
Make everything louder, I wanna hear my eardrums break
More volts in the system, drown out the symptoms
Everything louder, louder
I don’t wanna listen, just wanna feel it
Feel it louder, louder

Put me in a sound proof room
A million miles from you
My ears would still be bleeding, shots of noise
Still seeping through
I wish I couldn't hear you 
So pull every pin from every grenade
And blow it all up in my face, boom

Make everything louder, do it till my skin vibrates
Make everything louder, I wanna hear my eardrums break
More volts in the system, drown out the symptoms
Everything louder, louder
I don’t wanna listen, just wanna feel it
Feel it louder, louder

And you got the power
You got the power
You know the words that work
You know the words that work on me

You got the power
You got the power
You know the words that work
You know the words that work on me

Make everything louder, do it till my skin vibrates
Make everything louder, I wanna hear my eardrums break
More volts in the system, drown out the symptoms
Everything louder, louder
I don’t wanna listen, just wanna feel it
Feel it louder, louder
