Standing on the edge of the cliff
And I'm thinking it through my mind
I'm afraid that I'm about to slip
Because my body is out of time 
And I think, I think, I think, I think
I think until I'm nearly there
Do you remember when you were young
Do you remember what your mother said 

She said don't ever think, 
ever think, ever think too much
Don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
Don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
Don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much 

Obsession is a terrible thing
Cause it happens to everyone
Cause Mother Nature comes with a sting
And ... 

And I'm lying, I'm lying, I'm lying awake
Lying in my lonely bed
Do you remember when you were young
Do you remember what your mother said 

She said don't ever think, 
ever think, ever think too much
Don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
Don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
Don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much 

And I think again, and I think again
It's just the thinking, I don't understand
It's all hopes, ...
The persecution is on fire 

Don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
And don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
And don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
And don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
