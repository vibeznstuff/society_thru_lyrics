I'm so rushed off my feet, (oh-oh)
Looking for Gordon street,
So much I need to say, 
I’m sorry that its on her wedding day...
Coz she’s so right for me, (oh-oh)
Her daddy disagrees,
He’s always hated me, 
Coz I never got, a j-o-b...



Coz she’s mine, 
And i’m glad i crashed the wedding,
Its better than regretting,
I could have been a loser kid
And ran away and hid
But it's the best thing that I ever did.
Coz true love lasts forever
And now we’re back together
As if he never met her
So looking back, 
I'm glad i crashed the wedding...

The neighbours spread the word (and), 
My mom cried when she heard,
I stole my girl away, 
From everybody gathered there that day.



And, just in time, 
And I’m glad i crashed the wedding,
Its better than regretting,
I could have been a loser kid
And ran away and hid
I said I'd do it and I did.
Coz true love lasts forever
And now we’re back together
As if he never met her
So looking back, 
I'm glad i crashed the wedding...

Don't waste time being
Mad at me for taking her away, coz
Anyway she didn’t want to stay.
So please believe me when I say

She’s glad I crashed the wedding
Its better than regretting...
The ring she got was lame
She couldn’t take the pain,
She didn’t want a silly second name
Coz true love lasts forever,
And now we’re back together
You might as well forget her,
And walk away

She’s glad I crashed the wedding...
It's better than regretting... (it's better than regretting)
The ring she got was lame
She couldn't take the pain,
She didn't want a silly second name (no no no no)
Coz true love lasts forever, (true love lasts)
And now we're back together
You might as well forget her
And walk away
She's glad I crashed the wedding...
