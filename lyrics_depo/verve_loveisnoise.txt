Will those feet in modern times 
Walk on soles that are made in China? 
Through the bright prosaic malls 
And the corridors that go on and on and on 

Are we blind - can we see? 
We are one, incomplete 
Are we blind - in the city? 
Waiting for lightning to be saved, yeah 
Cause love is noise, love is pain 
Love is these blues that I'm singing again 

Love is noise, love is pain 
Love is these blues that I'm singing again, again, again, again, again 

Will those feet in modern times 
Understand this world's affliction? 
Recognise the righteous anger? 
Understand this world's addiction? 

I was blind - couldn't see 
What was here in me 
I was blind - insecure 
Felt like the road was way too long, yeah 
Cause love is noise, love is pain 
Love is these blues that I'm singing again 
Love is noise, love is pain 
Love is these blues that I'm singing again 
Love is noise, love is pain 
Love is these blues that I'm feeling again 
Love is noise, love is pain 
Love is these blues that I'm singing again, again, again, again, again, again, again 

Cause love is noise, love is pain 
Love is these blues that you're feeling again 
Love is noise, love is pain 
Love is these blues that I'm singing again, again, again, again, again, again, again 

All those feet in modern times 
Walk on soles made in China 
Will those feet in modern times 
See the bright prosaic malls 
Will those feet in modern times 
Recognise the heavy burden 
Will those feet in modern times 
Pardon me for my sins? 
Love is noise
