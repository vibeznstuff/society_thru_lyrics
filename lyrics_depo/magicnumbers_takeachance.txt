What You gonna do when it all breaks down
Take another heart through this lonely town
What You gonna do when she turns around
And says I never ever thought that you'd be messing 'round

But then You dance dance dance with the woman that let's you
How's it gonna feel until I catch You
What You gonna do when she turns around
And says you broke another heart that was broken down

It's a crying shame, that the love you've made
Is a cross that you bear when it's cold
Why don't you leave me alone?
