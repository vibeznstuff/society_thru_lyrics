Look into my mind 
there's version of you 
i cannot sleep at night 
for fear of the truth,OH 
should i take the blame 
or should i stand in your way 
or is it too much too late 

Look into my eyes 
i'm dazed by the light 
it took me by surprise 
your sadness last night 
maybe it is fate that 
we made this mistake, 
Now it's too much too late 

What about us? 
are you scared enough 
that you need someone to run to 
What about us? 
are you strong enough 
to throw the dream away 
What about us? 
are you scared enough 
that you need someone to run to 
Reality come back to me 

Look into the past 
Reflect on the pain 
did we move too fast 
while feelin' the strain 
why are we feelin' this hate 
Now it's too much too late 

What about us? 
Baby,got to realise 
OOh come on you know 
you got me hypnotised out to control 
Got no soul at the stage of the game 
the danger of the roll of the dice playin' 
around with our lives 
makin' all the decisions No Alibis 
Let's feel the flow come on lock the door 
Don't cuss 'n' tell me some 
i wanna know about US
