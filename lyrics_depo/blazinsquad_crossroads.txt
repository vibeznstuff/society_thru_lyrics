so why you gotta go and pray your gonna make it some day 
you got a job so why do u want a raise 
why you wanna act tough why cant you 
play this whole fame 
thing just comes one of these days 
when it comes youll be one of a kind 
but b4 this keep all this in your mind 
cos i will hold you till the end of the line want all this youll be mad to decline 

 
so what you gonna do when everydays the same 
try and do this 
shush just 4 a glimpse of fame 
didnt mean 2 do it 
just put yourself 2 shame 
didnt want 2 kill her just tryin 2 play the game 
wen u reach the crossroads where you gonna go 
go with your coinsience 
just let your feelings flow 
lifes up lifes down 
but things can turn around 
innocent or guilty you will soon be found 


So what ya gonna do when people hate you 
jack you 
beat you 
they dont like you 
cant run away coz they will find you 
prayin for answers wot ya gonna do 
make decisions where ya gonna go 
take the crossroads go with the flow 
you gotta come easy and then you gotta go 
your livin in a hateful world 
keep low 


mmmm and we pray and we pray and we pray and we pray 
everyday everyday everyday everyday 
and we pray and we pray and we pray and we pray 
still we lay still we lay 


Theres things in life you have to make 
which path you take is like deja-vou 
stand by your side 
stand next to you 
be there in the middle when your passin through 
in the middle meet you at the crossroads 
between love and hate 
between good and evil 
we can see right through you 
when you tell the truth 
all single lie 
we brake sumthin 
your gonna make a man cry 
dont wanna talk about the day your gonna die 
sooner or later that day will come 
when you have to make a right or wrong decision 
its hard to take and make 
good and bad they just seperate you 
wanna do that sht 
prime resists at the end of the day 
its up to you 
ill be there in the middle when your passin through.


(so you wont be lonley) 

 
see you at the crossroads see you 
see you at the crossrads see you 


 
whos that get off the train 
avirex jacket with the poor with the rain 
why take that mans chain 
no more trouble made 

 living on the streets everyday so lame 
people walking past looking at you in shame 
but they dont really care whos the one 2 blame 
youre gonna take the wrong turn your gonna lose the game 
you no its not ur fault that life turned this way 
but ppl dont care dont hear what you say 
the way it is now is the ways it gonna stay 
theres no choice left but to hope and pray 



(so you wont b lonley)
