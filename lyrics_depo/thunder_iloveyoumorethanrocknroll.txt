Better listen to me, baby
It's time to speak the truth
You'd better believe it baby
I know I've got the proof

Cos I didn't catch your name
And I know it sounds insane
But I've got reason to believe
I was meant for you

Cos I love you more than rock 'n' roll
Trust me baby
I think I love you more than rock 'n' rol

It's the way that you move, baby
Such a dirty grind
Got a glimpse of tattoo, baby
But I knew you wouldn't mind

Cos I know it's got to be
And I, I got to make you see
That I love you more than rock 'n' roll
On my life
I think I love you more than rock 'n' roll
Say it one more time
I love you more than rock 'n' roll

Kinda gets in my soul, baby

So there you go, baby is my intention clear?
And now that you know, baby, there ain't nothing to fear

Cos I never thought I'd say, what I've said today
I guess it goes to show you that I'm sincere

Cos I love you more than rock 'n' roll
Can you feel it?
I think I love you more than rock 'n' roll
I love you more than rock 'n' roll
Yeah yeah, yeah
I love you more than rock 'n' roll
