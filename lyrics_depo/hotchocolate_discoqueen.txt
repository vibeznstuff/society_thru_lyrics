Don't need no man to give her satisfaction
All she needs is a guitar playin' high
She don't need no sweet-talkin' man
Tell her how much he loves her
Break her heart and leave her alone to cry

Yeah, yeah music is her lover - disco queen, disco queen
Music turns her on and on
Music is her lover
Music turns her on and on - disco queen, disco queen

She don't need no kind of useless information
But the way she moves when she's dancin' on the floor
The disco queen's aware she causes a sensation
Cause every head in the place to stop and stare

Yeah, yeah music is her lover - disco queen, disco queen
Music turns her on and on - an' on an' on
Music is her lover
Music turns her on and on

No point in talkin', you're talkin' to yourself
The disco queen is away somewhere else
You think your bumpin' and you're bumpin' with yourself
Disco queen is high - high high high high high

She don't need no man to give her satisfaction
All she needs is a guitar playing high
Don't need no sweet-talkin' man
Tell her how much he loves her
Break your heart and leave her alone to cry

Yeah, yeah music is her lover - disco queen, disco queen
Music turns her on and on
Music is her lover
Music turns her on and on - disco queen, disco queen
