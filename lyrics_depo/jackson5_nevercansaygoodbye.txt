Never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no... I
I never can say goodbye
Even tho' the pain and heartache seem to follow me wherever I go
Tho' I tried and tried to hide my feelings then always seem to show
Then you try to say you're leaving me and I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so?
But I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no
I never can say goodbye
Ev'ry time I think I've had enough and start heading for the door
There's very strange vibrations, piercing me right to the core
It says turn around you fool you know you love her more and more
Tell me why is it so?

Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye girl
(never can say goodbye, girl)
Ohh, ohh, baby,
(don't wanna let you go, girl)
I never can say goodbye,
No, no, no, no, no, no

Ohh, I never can say goodbye girl
(never can say goodbye, girl)
Ohh, ohh, ohh,
(don't wanna let you go, baby)
I never can say goodbye,
No, no, no, no, no, no,
Ohh

Never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no
I never can say goodbye
I keep thinkin' that our problems soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feelin' there's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's that same old dizzy hang-up can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so?

Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye girl
(never can say goodbye, girl)
Ohh, ohh, baby,
(baby)
I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no

Ohh, I never can say goodbye girl
(never can say goodbye, girl)
Ohh, ohh, ohh,
(baby)
I never can say goodbye,
No, no, no, no, no, no,
Ohh
