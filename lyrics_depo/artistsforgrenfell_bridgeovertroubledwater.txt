Yeah, I don't know where to begin
So I'll start by saying I refuse to forget you
I refuse to be silenced
I refuse to neglect you
That's for every last soul up in Grenfell
Even though I've never even met you
Cuh that could've been my mum's house
Or that could've been my nephew
Now, that could've been me up there
Waving my white plain tee up there
With my friends on the ground trying a see up there
I just hope that you rest and you're free up there
I can't feel your pain but it's still what it is
Went to the block just to chill with the kids
Troubled waters come running past
I'ma be right there just to build you a bridge, yo


When you're weary

And feeling small

When tears are in

Your eyes

I will dry them all

I'm on your side

Oh, when times get rough

And friends just can't be found


Like a bridge over troubled water

I will lay me down

Like a bridge over troubled water

I will lay me down


So much pain in my heart
My community's moving me
Choose to gleam as we're facing the dark


When you're down and out

When you're on the street

When evening falls so hard

I will comfort you

Yes, I will

I'll take your part

When darkness comes

And pain is all around


Like a bridge over troubled water

I will lay, will lay me down

Like a bridge over troubled water

I will lay me down
