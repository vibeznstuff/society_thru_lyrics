I put on my jeans and shirt and shoes the same
And I’ll leave my house and show my face again
I thought that I could find a way to hide the truth
But everybody knows
Everybody knows

I’m tryna smile
I’m tryna lie
I’m tryna live another life

Tryna be the me without you
It’s like driving in a car with no wheels
Flying through the sky with no wings
A needle in the eye don’t sting
When you’re underwater you can’t breathe
When I need to call you I can’t reach
Tryna light a fire with no spark
No match and no fuse
Tryna to be me without you

Oh it’s hard to find somebody new
When the only one I’m looking for is you
I thought that I could find a way to hide the truth
But everybody knows
Everybody knows
I’m tryna smile
I’m tryna lie
I’m tryna live another life

Tryna be the me without you
It’s like driving in a car with no wheels
Flying through the sky with no wings
A needle in the addict don’t sting
When you’re underwater you can’t breathe
When I need to call you I can’t reach
Tryna light a fire with no spark
No match and no fuse
Tryna to be me without you
Me without you

I’m tryna win
I’m tryna find
I’m tryna make it through the night

I’m tryna run
I’m tryna sleep
I’m tryna feel
I’m tryna keep on

Tryna be the me without you
It’s like driving in a car with no wheels
Flying through the sky with no wings
A needle in the addict don’t sting
When you’re underwater you can’t breathe
When I need to call you I can’t reach
Tryna light a fire with no spark
No match and no fuse
Tryna to be me without you
