Can't decide if I should read or think 
I'll keep an open mind, till the day sets in 
Hear you call me, I'm so willing to call back 
Hear you thinking, hope you hear me thinking too 


Why can't I wake up with you 
S you're there when I open my eyes 
Baby why can't I wake up with you 
You're my life 

I feel alive, so I'll just begin 
Te rest my mind, before you ring me 
Hear you thinking, hope you hear me thinking too 



So good to be near you, so dark when you walk from my side 
Baby why can't I wake up with you, you're my life, you're my life
