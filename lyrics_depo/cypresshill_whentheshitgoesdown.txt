Livin on phat pockets on flat wit tha gat
rollin around nine deuce cadillac
still got my homies to watch my back
and they'll smoke ya ass if ya wanna come chat
thats why some pigs an tha kids come sweatin they follow
a hollow point shell's hard ta swallow
why wallow when ya come ta roll on i put tha clip an dust
bring ya ass on,kickin dust on ya head as tha gatt busts
my grip surronded im about ta get rushed i brushed wit death
how many shells stuffed in my closet???

when tha shit goes down ya better be ready (when tha shit goes down)
when tha shit goes down ya better be ready (when tha shit goes down)
when tha shit goes down ya better be ready (when tha shit goes down)
when tha shit goes down ya better be ready (ya better be ready)

i told tha boyz get tha sawed off glock and tha rest of tha gats
as i strapped on tha bullet-proof vest
BOOM i think i got one to tha chest
hot damn I didn't want to kill a man shit
i still stand tall with tha hill clan ya'll better stand back
niggaz bout ta fall I'm comin out blastin like yosemite
sam get tha cheese an tha bread for tha ham

when tha shit goes down ya better be ready (when tha shit goes down)
when tha shit goes down ya better be ready (when tha shit goes down)
when tha shit goes down ya better be ready (when tha shit goes down)
when tha shit goes down ya better be ready (ya better be ready)
