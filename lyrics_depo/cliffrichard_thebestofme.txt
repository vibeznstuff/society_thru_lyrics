So many years gone
Still I remember
How did I ever let my heart believe
In one who never gave enough to me
And so many years gone
With love that was so wrong
I can't forget the way it used to be
And how you changed the taste of love for me

You were my one more chance 
I never thought I'd find
You were the one moment
I'll always have in my mind
No-one will ever touch me more
And I only hope that in return
I might have saved the best of me for you

And we'll have no ending
If we can hold on 
And I think I've come this far because of you
Could be no other love but yours will do

You were my one more chance 
I never thought I'd find
You were the one moment
I'll always have in my mind
No-one will ever touch me more
And I only hope that in return
I might have saved the best of me for you

No-one will ever touch me more
And I only hope that in return
No matter how much we have to learn
I might have saved the best of me for you

For you
I saved the best of me

You were my one more chance
You were the one romance
