I knew I'd run into you
Someday out there somewhere
You'd smile and talk for a while
Like there was nothing ever really there

You act like you don't see this pretty girl I've got with me
You finally get around to the part about "Boy, did you miss me?"

I missed you on your weekend whiskey
Getting crazy at the bar
I missed you running late on Sundays
Sliding in as the preacher starts
I missed you at my sister's wedding
I'd be lying if I said you didn't cross my mind
I've found the love of my life
I think I missed you just right

In a crazy way I should thank you
For making me move on
I was surprised with your goodbye baby
But now I'm grateful that you're gone

I've found the one who makes the mistakes I made make perfect sense
She'll ask me if I think about you every now and then

I missed you on your weekend whiskey
Getting crazy at the bar
I missed you running late on Sundays
Sliding in as the preacher starts
I missed you at my sister's wedding
I'd be lying if I said you didn't cross my mind
I've found the love of my life
I think I missed you just right

No I'm not sad or angry like I was
I'm just in love

I missed you on your weekend whiskey
Getting crazy at the bar
I missed you running late on Sundays
Sliding in as the preacher starts
I missed you at my sister's wedding
I'd be lying if I said you didn't cross my mind
I've found the love of my life
I think I missed you just right
Yeah I missed you just right
I think I missed you just right
