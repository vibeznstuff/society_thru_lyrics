Hush little baby don't you cry
I said hush little baby don't you cry 
I'm saying hush little baby don't you cry
Daddy ain't sure if he can raise you right
I ain't even good with saving my money
Why should I think I can save your life?
And the whole family's gonna think I'm a devil, I don't wanna see my angels eyes
I say this with one hand on my heart, guilt ain't gonna make me change my mind
My first thoughts, were the worst thoughts, running 'round my head in circles
The worlds gonna hate me for saying this, but patience is a virtue
So we don't have to rush for our first youth, we can take time do rehearsals
And I ain't acting this is personal, and I ain't doing this just to hurt you


I should say goodbye, before I say hello
So darling hold me, closely, tonight
Because if you open your eyes, I'll never let you go
Moving slowly, we'll both sleep tonight
And we'll just be dreaming 'til you wake me up


When I'm telling her about raving
She's telling me about cravings
I want her to just get the message
I don't wanna have to be so blatant
So I told her my life ain't balanced
Yeah, said the time ain't right
She said god's clock's the only one that matters
And it's about time I tried, yeah and if I listen to my family
Then they'll be a new addition to my family
I can't help feeling peer pressured, everybody's looking down but they don't understand me
And everyone's so suggestive, I'm getting mixed messages, but nobody's rang me
Huh, I'm saying this ain't a game, but I say the wrong thing and everyone wants to hang me.


I should say goodbye, before I say hello
So darling hold me, closely, tonight
Because if you open your eyes, I'll never let you go
Moving slowly, we'll both sleep tonight
And we'll just be dreaming 'til you wake me up

Hush little baby don't you cry,
I said hush little baby don't you cry,
I said hush little baby don't you cry, no,
I said hush little baby don't you cry


I should say goodbye, before I say hello
So darling hold me, closely, tonight
Because if you open your eyes, I'll never let you go
Moving slowly, we'll both sleep tonight
And we'll just be dreaming 'til you wake me up
