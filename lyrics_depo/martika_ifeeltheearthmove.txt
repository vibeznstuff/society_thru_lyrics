Oh baby when I see your face
Mellow as the month of May
Oh darling I cant stand it
When you look at me that way

I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down tumbling down
I feel my heart start to trembling
Whenever you're around

Oh darling when I'm near you
And you tenderly call my name
I know that, My emotions
Are something I just cant explain
Ive just got to have you baby
Ooh yeah, ooh ooh yeah yeah

I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down tumbling down
I feel my heart start to trembling
Whenever you're around
