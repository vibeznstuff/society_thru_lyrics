I've done my share of workin' out.
I wanna go some place, where I can scream and shout.
Show me the lights, where I can find
The only thing I need to give me peace of mind!

I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go Hot Rockin'

Where is the spark that kicks the air?
Where is the energy that charges everywhere?
I see the crowd, I hear the roar!
I feel my body to leave the ground and soar!

I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go Hot Rockin'!

I'm goin' out in search of the bright lights.
Somehow I feel that tonight is the right night!
I'm almost there, I've got the vibration.
It's coming strong from this generation.
My blood is hot, from now on I'm set free!
My pulse is hot, so don't try to stop me!
Cuz this is it, and I'm Hot Rockin'!

Don't let it stop, don't let it end,
Please let it carry on and on and on again.
I get so high. Knocked off my feet, yeah!
This is the only way I want, I want, I want

I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go Hot Rockin'!

It's all I want, it's all I crave.
I just do want to go Hot Rockin'!
