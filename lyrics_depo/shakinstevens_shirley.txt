Shirley
Shirley
I love you so
I'm never gonna let you go -
Shirley
where are you going tonight?
Shirley
Shirley
will you be my girl? I'll take you all around the world
Shirley
where are you going tonight?
Oh Shirley
Shirley
I'd buy you anything - would you like a diamond rings
Shirley
where are you going tonight?
I called Shirley's mama on the phone
she said
Shirley's not at home.
She said
my little girl won be back soon - she's gone on a honeymoon
Oh Shirley
Shirley
you've done me wrong
that's why I sing this song
Shirley
where are you going tonight?

I called Shirley's mama on the phone
she said Shirley's not at home.

Oh Shirley
Shirley
I love you so - I'm never gonna let
you go -
Shirley
where are you going tonight? 
Shirley
where are you going
Shirley
where are you going tonight?
