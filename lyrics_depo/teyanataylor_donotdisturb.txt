So I got this feeling
You and I need a moment
I want you to love me, babe
Make me know it
I need you to want me, babe
Come and show it


Let me satisfy you tonight
Come inside, sit on my couch, oh
I know what you like just sit back
Let me ride, hear it all out, uh
I want you right now
Not another minute later, so come on
Put your money where your mouth is
Give you what you paid for, come on
I know it's real how my body feels on yours, oh
And I want to spend some time
No enter sign on the door
Oh, no, please don't disturb
Please, no, don't disturb, no


So I got this feeling
That you and I need this moment
I want you to touch me, baby
Let me feel it
I need you to hold me, baby
If you willing




Like a cop I'm cuffing I'm copping a feel
Little mama got ass when she walk in them heels
She love when I eat it, she make it meal
Baby girl, screaming
I give her the pillow so no one can hear


Oh, he biting my neck and my legs in the air
Tell me you love me then pull on my hair
I like it rough, don't be gentle, my nigga
It ain't rocket science it's simple, my nigga

Oh, no, please don't disturb
Please, no, don't disturb, no
