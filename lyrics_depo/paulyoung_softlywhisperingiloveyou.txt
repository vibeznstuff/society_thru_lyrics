Softly whispering I love you
Echoes of your voice are calling still from my dreams
Softening the chill of the breeze
Through my window, I can see the moon glow
Painting silver shadows on a rose colored land
A world that we walk hand in hand
In a day of gold covered by the glow of new love

I can feel your warm face, ever close to my lips
And the scent of you invades a cool evenin' air
I can close my eyes and you're there
You're in my arms still, oh I know your soft kiss
Turning into music every beat of my heart
When I hold you close to my heart
And I hear your voice whispering I love you

I can feel your warm face, ever close to my lips
And the scent of you invades a cool evening air
I feel you there in my arms still
And I know your soft kiss
Is turning into music every beat of my heart
And I hear your voice whispering I love you

Ooh I know I need you
I feel you there in my arms still
I keep to forget
I love you
