Now take me dancing, at the disco
Where you buy your winniebago
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse

When the light turns into darkness
Will he turn up to explain us
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse

Lend me a whole new world
All night, feel life, oh, oh
When is there ever sense
To love, this world, oh, oh

In the whirlpool, we'll go deeper
In this world that's getting cheaper
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse

I like dancing, at the disco
I want blisters, your my leader
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse

Lend me a whole new world
All night, feel life, oh, oh
When is there ever sense
To love, this world, oh, oh

Lend me a whole new world
All night, feel life, oh, oh
When is there ever sense
To love, this world, oh, oh

Oh I love this feeling
Feels like forever
Oh I love this feeling 
Feels like real leather
