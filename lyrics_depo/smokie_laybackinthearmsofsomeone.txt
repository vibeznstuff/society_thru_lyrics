If you want my sympathy
Just open your heart to me
And you'll get whatever you'll ever need
You think that's too high for you
Oh baby, I would die for you
When there's nothin' left
You know where I'll be

Lay back in the arms of someone
You give in to the charms of someone
Lay back in the arms of someone you love
Lay back in the arms of someone
When you feel you're a part of someone
Lay back in the arms of someone you love

So baby just call on me
When you want all of me
And I'll be your lover, I'll be your friend
And there's nothing I won't do
'Cause baby I just live for you
With nothing to hide, no need to pretend
Oo oo ooh

Lay back in the arms of someone
You give in to the charms of someone
Lay back in the arms of someone you love
Lay back in the arms of someone
When you feel you're a part of someone
Lay back in the arms of someone you love

Oh I know you think that's too high for you
But baby, I would die for you
When there's nothing left
I'll be with you

Lay back in the arms of someone
You give in to the charms of someone
Lay back in the arms of someone you love
(Ba...aby!)
Lay back in the arms of someone
When you feel you're a part of someone
Lay back in the arms of someone you love
(Oh yeah!)
(Lord, I know!)
