In one single moment your whole life can turn 'round 
I stand there for a minute starin’ straight into the ground 
Lookin’ to the left slightly, then lookin’ back down 
World feels like it’s caved in – proper sorry frown 
Please let me show you where we could only just be, for us 
I can change and I can grow or we could adjust 
The wicked thing about us is we always have trust 
We can even have an open relationship, if you must 
I look at her she stares almost straight back at me 
But her eyes glaze over like she’s lookin’ straight through me 
Then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity 
When they open up she’s lookin’ down at her feet 

Dry your eyes mate 
I know it’s hard to take but her mind has been made up 
There’s plenty more fish in the sea 
Dry your eyes mate 
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts 
But you’ve got to walk away now 
It’s over 

So then I move my hand up from down by my side 
It's shakin’, my life is crashin’ before my eyes 
Turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies 
Touch the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh 
‘Cause I can’t imagine my life without you and me 
There’s things I can’t imagine doin’, things I can’t imagine seein’ 
It weren't supposed to be easy, surely 
Please, please, I beg you please 
She brings her hands up towards where my hands rested 
She wraps her fingers round mine with the softness she’s blessed with 
She peels away my fingers, looks at me and then gestures 
By pushin’ my hand away to my chest, from hers 

Dry your eyes mate 
I know it’s hard to take but her mind has been made up 
There’s plenty more fish in the sea 
Dry your eyes mate 
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts 
But you’ve got to walk away now 
It’s over 

And I’m just standin’ there, I can’t say a word 
‘Cause everythin’s just gone 
I’ve got nothin’ 
Absolutely nothin’ 

Tryin’ to pull her close out of bare desperation 
Put my arms around her tryin’ to change what she’s sayin’ 
Pull my head level with hers so she might engage in 
Look into her eyes to make her listen again 
I’m not gonna fuckin’, just fuckin’ leave it all now 
‘Cause you said it'd be forever and that was your vow 
And you’re gonna let our things simply crash and fall down 
You’re well out of order now, this is well out of town 
She pulls away, my arms are tightly clamped round her waist 
Gently pushes me back and she looks at me straight 
Turns around so she’s now got her back to my face 
Takes one step forward, looks back, and then walks away 

Dry your eyes mate 
I know it’s hard to take but her mind has been made up 
There’s plenty more fish in the sea 
Dry your eyes mate 
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts 
But you’ve got to walk away now 
It’s over 

I know in the past I’ve found it hard to say 
Tellin’ you things, but not tellin’ straight 
But the more I pull on your hand and say 
The more you pull away 

Dry your eyes mate 
I know it’s hard to take but her mind has been made up 
There’s plenty more fish in the sea 
Dry your eyes mate 
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts 
But you’ve got to walk away now.
