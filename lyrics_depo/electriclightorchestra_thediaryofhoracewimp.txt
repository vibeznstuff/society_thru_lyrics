Monday: Late again, today, he'd be in trouble though
He'd say he was sorry, he'd have to hurry out the bus

Tuesday: Horace was so sad, he'd never had a girl that he
could care for, and if he was late once more, he'd be out


Don't be afraid, just knock on the door
Well he just stood there mumblin' and fumblin'
Then a voice from above said
"Horace Wimp, this is your life
Go out and find yourself a wife
Make a stand and be a man
And you will have a great life plan"

Wednesday: Horace met a girl, she was small
And she was very pretty, he thought he was in love, he was afraid

Thursday: Asks her for a date, the cafe down the street
tomorrow evening, his head was reeling
When she said "Yes O.K."



Friday: Horace, this is it, he asks the girl if maybe
They could marry, when she says "gladly"
Horace cries

Sunday: Everybody's at the church, when Horace rushes in
And says "Now here come my wife
For the rest of my life"
And she did

Don't be afraid, just knock on the door
Well he just stood there mumblin' and fumblin'
Then a voice from above said
"Horace Wimp, this is your wife
Go out and find yourself a life
Make a stand and be a man
And you will have a great life plan"

Horace, Horace, Horace, Horace, Horace, Horace,
Horace, Horace, Horace, Horace, Horace, Horace
