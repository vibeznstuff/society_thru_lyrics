My love for you,
Is deep and endless as the sea.
Strong and mighty as a tree,
My love for you.

My eager heart,
Keeps beating just for you alone.
Since the moment,
It has known,
My love for you.

There'll be no other lips,
No other arms,
No other love for me.
Feeling as I do,
How could there be?

And so,
It will be,
Far beyond eternity,
Ever faithful, ever true,
My love for you.

So, it will be,
Far beyond eternity,
Ever faithful, ever true,
My love for you.

My love,
For you!
