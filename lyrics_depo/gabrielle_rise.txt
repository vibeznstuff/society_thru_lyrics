I know that it's over 
But I can't believe we're through
They said that time's a healer
And I'm better without you
It's gonna take time I know
But I'll get over you


Look at my life 
Look at my heart
I have seen them fall apart
Now I'm ready to rise again
Look at my hopes 
Look at my dreams
I'm building bridges from these scenes
Now I'm ready to rise again

Caught up in my thinking, yeah
Like a prisoner in my mind
You pose so many questions 
But the truth was hard to find
I better think twice I know
That I'll get over you



Much time has passed between us 
Do you still think of me at all?
My world of broken promises
Now you won't catch me when I fall
