I just can't stop the feelings
Don't seem to go away
So if I hurt your feelings
Don't blame it all on me

I just can't stop the feelings
(Nothing else to say)
And now they're here to stay
So if I hurt your feelings
(Don't take it the wrong way)
It's just because I'm..

Oh, la la la la, la la la la
Oh, la la la la, la la la frisky
Oh, la la la la, la la la la
Oh, la la la la, la la la frisky

I think I found a winner, with no ring around her finger
Her dress from All Saints, but I think I've found a sinner

I think her pals are with her, who's that girlfriend? Buy me a liquor
If I told her I'm a boxer, would she let me her knickers

I wanna pick her up, pin her down
She gon' be waking up my neighbors if I bring her 'round
Where I'm from, if you're famous, you don't go to Tinsletown
Pose for a picture, smile, the fashionista's out

They say, “Hey mista, is it cool to take a picture?”
Girl, you better keep your distance, I just wanna have
I'm on a mission, I don't even wanna kiss her
Honey, I won't even miss ya when I'm done with ya

I just can't stop the feelings
(Nothing else to say)
Don't seem to go away
So if I hurt your feelings
(Don't take it the wrong way)
It's just because I'm..

Oh, la la la la, la la la la
Oh, la la la la, la la la frisky
Oh, la la la la, la la la la
Oh, la la la la, la la la frisky

Would you risk it for a chocolate biscuit?
Would you risk it for a chocolate biscuit?

Yeah, I'm suspicious, she looks delicious
She likes to talk a lot, that's why I call her Trisha
Her nails are manicured, her hair has been conditioned
Don't worry 'bout her rate, she ain't in no competition

She should be on television or on the radio singing
I would be the first to watch, and I would be the first to listen
I would put her in positions like the mission
From my staircase to her kitchen
Leave her twitchin', twitchin', twitchin', twitchin' ...

They say, “Hey mista, is it cool to take a picture?”
Girl, you better keep your distance, I just wanna have

Oh, la la la la, la la la frisky
Oh, la la la la, la la la la
Oh, la la la la, la la la frisky

Oh, la la la la, la la la la
Oh, la la la la, la la la frisky
Oh, la la la la, la la la la
Oh, la la la la, la la la frisky

I'm out of control, it's taking it's toll
We've still got a long way to go
I don't wanna take the piss
But I'm made for this, so let's take a risk
