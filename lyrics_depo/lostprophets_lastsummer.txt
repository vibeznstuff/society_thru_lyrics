The Friday sun bears down again 
As we drive with our friends 
And on these longest days we spend 
All the time trying to pretend 
That our stories could be true 
Wanting to be cool 
The setting sunset says the day is through 
If only we knew... 
And we all sit around here in our home town 
Listen to the waves as they all crash down 
And watch the fire as it slowly burns away 
Glowing embers fly across the sky your 

Here by my side, in my summer, our last summer 
The world passes by in my summer, our last summer 
The light makes shadows fall, surrounded by each other 
I let you watch it all, the view from our last summer 
The view from our last summer... 
We trace the sun across the sky 

And we laugh till we cry 
Always so hard to say goodbye (good bye) 
And we all sit round here in our home town 
It's so good like this, these are times we'll miss 
The memories, I hope will never fade
Glowing embers fly across the sky your 

Here by my side, in my summer, our last summer 
The world passes by in my summer, our last summer 
The light makes shadows fall, surrounded by each other 
I let you watch it all, the view through our last summer 
The view from our last summer... 

I would stop time to stay with you 
I would stop time so we don't move 
I would stop time 
I would stop time 
I would stop time to keep you 

Here by my side, in my summer, our last summer 
The world passes by in my summer, our last summer 
The light makes shadows fall, surrounded by each other 
I let you watch it all, the view from our last summer
