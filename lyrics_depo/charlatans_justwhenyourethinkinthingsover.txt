Just when you're thinkin' things over,
And you need a set of vows,
And all your friends seem disappointed,
To see the sun going down 
And when the sweetness you're saving is all the sweetness you doubt.
I'm coming home,
You look good when your heart is on fire,
It's a matter of taste yeah! 
You do it right you don't follow the line
Find of the sun.
Ooh! 
Ooh!
Ooh! 
Ooh! 
I found you soaking in liquid 
I found you there in your robe, 
Ain't no hands big enough to save us, 
I got the vibe I'm coming home. 
I see you close down the windows, 
I see you burn down your throne. 
Yeah! I'm coming home, 
You look good when your heart is on fire, 
It's a matter of taste yeah I you do it right 
You don't follow the line find the sun. 
I'm coming home. 
Ride out where do you come from, 
Kick up go find your love, 
I ain't knockin' all you've done. 
Just when you're thinkin' things over, 
Oh yeah you found your set of vows, 
And all your friends feel disappointed, 
'Cause they're not your friends now, 
And all the books that you've been through seem too sad to you now,
I'm coming home, 
You look good when your heart is on fire, 
It's a matter of taste yeah!
You do it fine you don't follow the line find the sun, 
Where you coming from lady. 
Yeah! I'm coming home, 
I wanna build my Rome and get high but I can't find my matches, 
And when you rap me you drive me to say this, 
Hey love I can't sing anymore, 
I'm coming home.
