Tell me who do you think you see
You’re standing in your corner looking out on me
You think I’m so predictable
Tell me who do you think I am
Looks can be deceiving
Better guess again
Tell me what you see
When you look at me


You’re probably thinking that I want those things
Cash, cars – diamond rings
Thinkin’ on my side the grass is green
But you don’t know where I have been
I could be a wolf in disguise
I could be an angel in your eyes
Never judge a book by it’s cover


I could be a crook or your lover
I could be the one or the other
If you’d look beneath you’d discover
You just don’t know me!




You look at your neighbor thinking ‘what a guy’
Cuz he’s got a 9-5
And I bet that you don’t realize
He stalks you while you sleep at night
Yet you’re scared of the homeless guy
Think he’s gonna wanna start a fight
Never judge a book by its cover






(Talk) Now tell me, who do you think I am? Huh?
You don’t even know me
Well did you think about this
