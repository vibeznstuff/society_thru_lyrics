You are the summer, I'll feel forever, I'll bleed forever
You think you are the greatest, I'll feel forever, I'll bleed forever
Think that the circus is friendly it's more like a mutual interest in a nosebleed, think again
Scared of the now, take all the air, look out dear, stick up kid, take all the air
I'll bleed forever, I'll bleed forever, I'll feel forever, I'll bleed forever
A-list with an alias, eradicate the doubt
Tackle heat it's in a cool cold slipstream that you will not find
Caught in a high speed hateful procedure
Scared of the now, take all the air, look out dear, stick up kid, take all the air
Sometimes, you'll dare to become forever and provoke the fear inside you, awaken
Take me to your heart, take me to your heart
