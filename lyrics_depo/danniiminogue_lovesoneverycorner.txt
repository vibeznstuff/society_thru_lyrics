Oh, remind
Love on every corner

Oh, remind
Love on every corner
Oh, remind me

Love on every corner
Reminding me, reminding me
Love on every corner
Reminding me, exactly how it should be

The only one who touched the heart of me
But I was just another lover
You could have satisfied the whole of me
You had the power to uncover

And I'm beginning to relive again
All the magic that you gave me
So don't you expect me to forget
When love is all around me

Love on every corner
Reminding me, reminding me
Love on every corner
Reminding me, exactly how it should be

Oh, Ooh
Love on every corner
Oh Oh Yeah

You touched me deeper than the eye could see
I never want another lover
A shining light amongst the stormy sea
You gave me more than any other

And I'm beginning to relive again
All the magic that you gave me
So don't you expect me to forget
When love is all around me

Nowhere I can run
Nowhere I can hide
Everywhere I turn, it's facing me
How should I forgive
How can I forget
Don't you know, exactly what it does to me
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

Love on every corner
Reminding me, reminding me
Love on every corner
Reminding me, exactly how it should be

How should I forgive
