
Let's take our time baby
Love last forever
Over and over
We'll love together
Come here next to me
And let me make you high
No mistakes we will make
A long time we will love



Kiss me hold me tight
And let's get wet tonight
Happiness is pleasing you
So let me make you cry



Slowly deep inside me
Hold me and kiss my body
Only you can make me
Oh so easy
