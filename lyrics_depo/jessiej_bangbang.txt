But I can give it to you all the time
She got a booty like a Cadillac
But I can send you into overdrive (oh)

(You've been waiting for that...
Step on up swing your bat)
See anybody could be bad to you,
You need a good girl to blow your mind, yeah


Bang bang into the room (I know ya want it)
Bang bang all over you (I'll let ya have it)
Wait a minute lemme take you there (ah)
Wait a minute till ya (ah)
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know ya want it)
Back, back seat of my car (I'll let ya have it)
Wait a minute lemme take you there (ah)
Wait a minute till ya (ah)


She might've let you hold her hand in school
But I'm a show you how to graduate
No, I don't need to hear you talk the talk
Just come and show me what your momma gave (oh, yeah)

(Okay you've got a very big shhh,
Mouth but don't say a thing)
See anybody could be good to you,
You need a bad girl to blow your mind


Bang bang into the room (I know ya want it)
Bang bang all over you (I'll let ya have it)
Wait a minute lemme take you there (ah)
Wait a minute till ya (ah)
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know ya want it)
Back, back seat of my car (I'll let ya have it)
Wait a minute lemme take you there (ah)

(You know what, girls?
Let me show you how to do.)
It's Myx Moscato
It's frizz in a bottle
It's Nicki full throttle
It's oh, oh.
Swimming in the grotto
We winning in the lotto
We dipping in the pot of blue foam
Kitten so good
It's drippin' on wood
Get a ride in the engine that could go
Batman Robin it
Bang, bang, cocking it
Queen Nicki dominant, prominent
It's me, Jessie, and Ari
If they test me they sorry
Ride his uh like a Harley
Then pull off in this Ferrari
If he hangin' we bangin'
Phone rangin', he slangin'
It ain't karaoke night but get the mic 'cause I'm singing (uh)

B to da' A to da' N to da' G to da' uh (baby)
B to da' A to da' N to da' G to da' hey
See anybody could be good to you,
You need a bad girl to blow your mind (your mind)


Bang bang into the room (I know ya want it)
Bang bang all over you (I'll let ya have it)
Wait a minute lemme take you there (ah)
Wait a minute till ya (ah)
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know ya want it)
Back, back seat of my car (I'll let ya have it)
Wait a minute lemme take you there (ah)
Wait a minute till ya (ah)


Bang bang into the room (I know ya want it)
Bang bang all over you (I'll let ya have it)


Yo, I said bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang


Bang bang there goes your heart (I know ya want it)
Back, back seat of my car (I'll let ya have it)
Wait a minute lemme take you there (ah)
Wait a minute till ya (ah)
