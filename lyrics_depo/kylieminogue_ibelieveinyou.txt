Don't believe you know me 
Although you know my name 
I don't believe the faults I have 
Are only mine to blame 
I don't believe in magic 
It's only in the mind 
I don't believe i'd love somebody 
Just to pass the time..

But I..i..i.. believe in you 
And I..i..i.. believe in you

I don't believe that beauty 
Will ever be replaced 
I don't believe a masterpiece 
Could ever match your face 
The joker's always smiling 
In every hand thats dealt 
I dont believe that when you die 
Your presence isnt felt

But I..i..i.. believe in you 
And I..i..i.. believe in you 
But I..i..i.. believe in you 
And I..i..i.. believe in you

And if you ever have to go away 
Nothing in my world could ever be the same 
Nothing lasts for ever, but together til the end 
I'll give you everything I have again and again

'Cause I believe In you, I believe In, 
I Believe in you, I Believe in, 
I Believe in you, I believe in, 
I believe in you, I Believe in,

'Cause I..i..i.. believe in you 
And I..i..i.. believe in you 
But I..i..i.. believe in you 
And I..i..i.. believe in you

I believe in you, I Believe in 
I believe in you, I Believe in 
I believe in you, I Believe in 
I believe in you, I Believe in

I believe, I believe, I believe in you....
