I said lets talk about it
as she walked out on me and slamed the door
but I just laugh about it
cuz shes always playin those games

C'mon
(deep down) deep down i know she loves me
but shes got a funny way of showin me how she cares (she cares)
last night she did a donut on my lawn
and drove out w/ her finger in the air
Oh yeah

Sometimes its black
Sometimes its white
Sometimes shes wrong
Sometimes im right
Sometimes we talk about it or we figure it out
But then she just changed her mind
Sometimes shes hot
Sometimes im cold
Sometimes my head wants to explode
But when i think about it im so in love with her

Every other time
nananananananananana
Every other time
nananananananananana
Every other time
nananananananananana
Every oth-every other time

sometimes we sit around
just the 2 of us on the park bench
sometimes we swim around
like 2 dolphins in the oceans of our hearts

but then i think about the time that we broke up before the prom
and u told everyone that I was gay "ok"
sometimes I walk around the town
for hours just to settle down
but I take you back
and u kick me down
cuz thats the way uhhu uhhu I like it

Sometimes its black
Sometimes its white
Sometimes shes wrong
Sometimes im right
Sometimes we talk about it or we figure it out
But then she just changed her mind
Sometimes shes hot
Sometimes im cold
Sometimes my head wants to explode
But when i think about it im so in love with her

Every other time
nananananananananana
yeah every other time
nananananananananana
Every other time
nananananananananana
Every oth-every other time

Keep it up home girl
don'tcha quit
u know the way u scream is the ultimate
And when I walk away
just watch the clock n then i don't even get around the block
and I say "let's talk about it"
as she walks out on me and slams the door
one day we'll laugh about it
cuz we're always playin those games
