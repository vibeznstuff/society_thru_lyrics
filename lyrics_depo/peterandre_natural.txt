Ya know it feels so good I'm here next to you
I like the way your natural with me baby
I wanna get with you


It feels so natural
Just to be with you
I wanna get it on (24/7 with you)
It feels so good to know

And make it last... all night

Hey girl got me going crazy
And I'd like to get with you
Ooh ya got me thinkin' about
All the things I wanna do

It would be a pleasure just to hold you through the night
And when I touch you hey girl

With a little candle light and sweet red wine
Don't you know baby, you'll be mine

So we can spend some time
So we'll unwind
And leave our worries behind

You got me hooked and it feels so right
Let's make this magic last for more than just one night


It feels so natural

It feels so good to know
We can take it slow
And make it last... all night
