I take it all back
All that I said
It comes out too fast
So I just couldn’t help
The way that I felt
I started the fire.

Watching you walk
I followed you there
Standing too close
It’s hurting.
I pictured the words
The warmth of your breath.
I started the fire
It’s burning.

And it feels like jealousy
And it feels like I can’t breathe
And I’m on, down on my knees
And it feels like jealousy.

Seeing a light
A face in the crowd
My lonely heart is racing.
And my whole world
Is under attack.
What kinda love am I facing?

Is it me that you want
Cause it’s me you can have
Can you give me an answer?

I’m tired of waiting.
I’m tired of thinking.

And it feels like jealousy
And it feels like I can’t breathe
And I’m on, down on my knees
And it feels like jealousy.

I’m tired of waiting.
I’m tired of thinking.

And it feels like jealousy (hey)
And it feels like I can’t breathe (I can’t breathe)
And I’m on, down on my knees (oh)
And it feels like jealousy.
