I ride all alone and can't see
The road to nowhere anymore
And shadows whispers are calling me
To forbidden forests by the shore
And there she fell, deep in the night
One breath away from heavens light
And she said - don't cry for me I'm leaving you
The wind cries her name in the breeze
But I can't hold her anymore /no, no, no/

Some fallen angel had come to me
And fell too heavy on my soul
And stole from me the love that I heard
Lords of time say never die
And she sad - don't cry for me, because I'll be

Riding the wind forever free
High in the wind forever free
I'll ride the wind forever free
High in the wind forever free

Forever in my hearts a fire, a fire burning
I wake up nights and hear her crying, crying my name
