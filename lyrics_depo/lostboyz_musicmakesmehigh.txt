East Coast bottom line, But I represent
wherever I go (what)
I'll be on the West Coast

who puff on the lie
for Lu-Lu,Sig, and Tai
everyday you know how we do (woo)
brothers tryin to wreck the crew

Niggas known me from day one
lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Violat'in they were even nameless


Yo Raff, ring the alarm

Freaky Tai spark the charm

As I bless the rest of my New York City Boo
as we continue to bring you the flav

from the cradle to the grave
now hows that, one time for your mind
but when I write down the line 
I give sight to the blind, I'm
Comin thru with the click

How do it feel with real niggas in your ass

Mr. Sex hit me off

Plug me in give me a sign to react on
whoever, comes in my path
make'em feel the wrath (Yeah,Yeah)
Are there, any Volunteers
down to lose their careers
Yo we feels no fears
Legal drug thugs comin thru

Beyond 95 L.B. Fam keep it real
It's hard as cleats
walkin on the fuckin strrets
Po-nine walks beats

So I gots to tally up and get it on
get it on, word is born,

till the day that I die it's L.B.
from the year 95 and true 'G's




To all of my, all my niggas doin Bids
To all of my shorties on their own raisin Kids
To all of my peoples who can't see
that we made it
niggas know the deal

Hit it to the left
who's the first one to get it to your mind and
state of shock when I hit it
run up on niggas who be frontin and scamming
Hey Yo that's word to mine
Get that Guy's for my Fam
Nobody wants in and nobody wants out
Smokin Trees, gettin 'G's
that's what we's all about
try to put it on for the year 9 pound
I represent my town

L-O-S-T to the B-O-Y-Z
Style flows on thru four families
I'm gonna stay free till the day that I die
Go with Pretty Lu, Spig Nice, and Freaky Tai (word up)
