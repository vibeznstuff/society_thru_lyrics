Pretty women out walking with gorillas down my street
From my window, I'm staring while my coffee goes cold
Look over there (where?)
There, there's a lady that I used to know
She's married now or engaged or something, so I'm told

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me, there's something going wrong around here

Tonight's the night when I go to all the parties down my street
I wash my hair and I kid myself I look real smooth
Look over there (where?)
There, here comes Jeanie with her new boyfriend
They say that looks don't count for much, if so, there goes your proof

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me, there's something going wrong around here
Around here

But if looks could kill
There's a man there who is marked down as dead
'Cause I've had my fill
Listen, you, take your hands from her head
I get so mean around the scene
Hey, hey, hey

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me, there's something going wrong around here
Around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around
