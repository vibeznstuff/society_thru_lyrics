I see you floating it constantly
You're making me feel like you and
I could be real
But then you're flipping the game
You walk away you turn your back baby
Stop treading on me
Baby

Coz I'm mystified
And you know I've tried
I just can't get through to you


What you gonna do
I don't know
What you gonna say
I ain't sure
Always the same
All the time
Every day
Played my mind
I can't keep wasting my time
On your game

Ain't no doubt about it 

I've taken all that I can
I've given to you my all but you don't
Seem to respond
Baby
Oh I can't stand all this waiting
Cos my patience is fading pretty
Soon I'll be gone

Lets rectify it
You can't deny it
The way you feel for me
Tell me



I can't keep wasting my time on 
Your game

No more
No more
No more wasted time
Playing your game
I've seen this all before
Time and time
No way

Coz I'm mystified
You know that I've tried
I just can't get through to you



I can't keep wasting my time on 
Your game

No more 
No more
No more wasted time
Playing your game
I've seen this all before
Time

Ain't no doubt about it
