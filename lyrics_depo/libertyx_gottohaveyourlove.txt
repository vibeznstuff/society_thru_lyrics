Every time I close my eyes, I can clearly see
The image of your smile shine through my darkest dreams
I never thought that I'd find myself this close, this close
To you my dear, tell me what it means
(Got to have your love)

I can feel your sweet caress wash away all the loneliness
That I once felt inside my heart, oh yeah
Boy, if you could read my mind I'm sure that you could find
What you've been searching for, what you've been searching for

Free me from despair, there's so much to share
If you surrender to me, oh yeah
Whisper in my ears, words I long to hear, ooh yeah

(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy, I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love

(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy, I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love, woah

Yeah, listen up, woo
I got to have your love like this

You're like an angel in disguise, I feel like I'm in heaven
When you walk my way you're such a mystery
The butterflies I feel inside must be, must be
A sign of love, no one can disagree

My desire for your love is like a new horizon
Only lovers see like you and I, I
Sacred love will be the start to sacred nights, our hearts
I'll love you till my dying day, until my dying day

Free me from despair, woah, there's so much to share
If you surrender to me, to me, to me, to me
Whisper in my ears, oh yeah words I long to hear, oh

(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy, I got to have your love, woah
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love

(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy, I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love

(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Ooh, I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
You know I need your love

(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy, I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart, heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love

(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy, I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love

(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy, I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love
