I heard you coming in from town
Stilettos scrape the ground
I saw you in your overcoat
Random on your throat

I know you this is not the girl
That I used to whirl around me
What's happening to you?
What's happening to you?

I love it, I shoot it like a Tommy gun
But you will carry on until the day you are done
You never know when to stop
You'll carry on until you're dead and drop
You will carry on until you're dead and you drop

You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll

You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll

Your teeth are starting to go
Five nights a week is starting to show
Dark rings around your eyes
Are fashionable until somebody dies

This pace a little too fast
You're a space cadet dressed in fiberglass
You're gonna shatter, it's not too late to undo
Put the fiddle down, the taming of the shrew

I love it, I shoot it like a Tommy gun
But you will carry on until the day you are done
You never know when to stop
You'll carry on until you're dead and drop
You will carry on until you're dead and you drop

You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll

You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll

You will never know when to stop
You'll carry on until you're dead and you drop
You will carry on until you're dead and you drop

I love it, I shoot it like a Tommy gun
But you will carry on until the day you are done
But you will carry on until the day you are done

You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll

You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
