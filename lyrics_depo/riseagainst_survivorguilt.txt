("What are you talking about? America is not going to be destroyed."
"Never?
Rome was destroyed, Greece was destroyed, Persia was destroyed, Spain was destroyed.
All great countries are destroyed. Why not yours?
How much longer do you really think your own country will last?
Forever?")

Block the entrances
Close the doors
Seal the exits
'Cause this is war

All gave some
Some gave all
But for what
I want to know

Carry on
Don't mind me
All I gave was everything
And yet you ask me for more
Fought your fight
Bought your lie
And in return I lost my life
What purpose does this serve?

A folded flag
A purple heart
A family all but torn apart
I fought with courage to preserve
Not my way of life, but yours

Carry on
Don't mind me
All I gave was everything
And yet you ask me for more
Fought your fight
Bought your lie
And in return I lost my life
What purpose does this serve?

The cowards preach from pedestals
With words like courage and resolve
But what they meant was fuck them all
'Cause freedom isn't free

They send our daughters and our sons
To deserts under burning suns
A sacrificial slaughtering to fill
The pockets of the weak
An artificial enemy
Are we so easily deceived?

They carry on

("You're a shameful opportunist! What you don't understand is that it's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.
"You had it backwards. It's better to live on your feet than to die on your knees.")

Don't carry on
Just walk away
How many more sent to their graves
In this lesson ignored?
I fought your fight
Bought your lie
And in return I lost my life
What purpose does this serve?
What purpose did I serve?
