Now I never seem to get the message
That is something I could never do
I could never be the one to hurt you

I'm just trying to make the whole life through
You live inside me, you caused me sorrow
And I should forgive you everything

I cannot give you my love
No matter how much you cry
Everything you say and do
Feel like a lie

Always be in your world
No matter how far you fly
To the moon and back
And back again and back again
I cannot give you my love but I'd try

And we are oceans apart but I follow my heart
There is nothing, nothing that I would rather be
I understand you, you got to be free, you and me

So fly away butterfly
Take it to your journey's end
You are here today and gone tomorrow
But I will always be your friend

Blessed are the souls who love each other
And I will never let the story die
And I vow to give you everything

I cannot give you my love
No matter how much you pray
Everything you say and do
Send me away

Always be in your world
For what your world is to you
To the moon and back and back again
And back again and back again
I cannot give you my love but I do

And though the oceans will roar
You will find me no more
There is no-one, no-one I would rather see
But I understand you, yeah

I cannot give you my love
No matter how much you cry
Everything you say and do
Feel like a lie

Always be in your world
No matter how you fly
To the moon and back and back again
And back again and back again
I cannot give you my love but I'd try

So fly away butterfly
Fly away, fly away
Fly away butterfly
