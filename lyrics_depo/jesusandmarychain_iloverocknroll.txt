I had trouble but I found my star
I found myself an electric guitar
Well I was some kind of messed up kid
Now look what you did
Look what you did
You made me, yeah
You make me, yeah

Well I'm not preaching or making a case
I'm not trying to make the world a better place
Well I ain't evil, but I ain't good
I did what I could
I did what I could
To save me, yeah
To save me, yeah

I love rock'n'roll
I love what I'm do-ooing
I need rock'n'roll
Gets me where I'm going

Don't need money if you've got soul
And it don't matter if you're young or you're old
Well I don't worry what the people say
They say what they say
I go my own way
But that's me, yeah
It suits me, yeah

I love rock'n'roll
I love what I'm do-ooing
I love rock'n'roll
Gets me where I'm going

Don't need anyone
Don't need anything
Don't need anybody
I need rock'n'roll
