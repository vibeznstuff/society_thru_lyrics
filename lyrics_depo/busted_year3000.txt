One day when I came home at lunchtime,
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the back yard to find out if it was,
One of those rowdy boys.
Stood there was my neighbour called Peter,
And a Flux Capacitor.

He told me he built a time machine
Like the one in a film I've seen.
Yeah, yeah.


He said,
"I've been to the year three thousand.
Not much has changed but they lived under water.
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is pretty fine (is pretty fine)."

He took me to the future in the flux thing and I saw everything,
Boy bands and another one and another one... and another one!
Triple breasted women swim around town... totally naked!

We drove around in a time machine,
Like the one in the film I've seen.
Yeah, yeah.



I took a trip to the year three thousand.
This song had gone multi-platinum.
Everybody bought our 7th album.
It had outsold Michael Jackson.
