There's too much silence in her night
She calls herself an angel, and she comes to town
I said L-O-N-D-O-N
Just so she can fall 
There's something about the way she walks, you know
It suits the city streets so well and yet
No one's heard her band yet, but they play real well 

Oh yeah, here it comes baby, and there's nothing to say
Here it comes now, you don't care anyway
He sees your eyes, you're just the rock'n'roll eyes
Oh but it's just lies, babe, it's just the rock'n'roll lies 

You've seen the man, he calls out for a drink, and you're all
You're all tied up in your backstage lines
And you, you just can't move a muscle 

Six in the morning and you rise and you fall, you got to
You got to grab what you can
Here comes your man, baby, he's a winner, yeah
He's a gunslinger 

Oh yeah, here it comes baby, and there's nothing to say
Here it comes now, you don't care anyway
He sees your eyes, you're just the rock'n'roll eyes
Oh but it's just lies, babe, it's just the rock'n'roll lies 

Oh baby, when you say my name I get, such a thrill inside
She says there's something in the way that I look at her
Yeah, I guess it's right here in my eyes
I can't lie 

And here it comes now, there's nothing to say
Here it comes now, you don't care anyway
You see those eyes, they're just a rock'n'roll eyes
Oh just like mine, babe, they're just a rock'n'roll eyes
Oh it's just the lies, babe, it's just the rock'n'roll lies
Oh it's just the lies, man, it's just the rock'n'roll lies
Oh...
