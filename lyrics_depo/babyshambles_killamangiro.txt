Ohhh ohhh ohhhh 
Why would you pay to see me in a cage? 
And why would you pay to see me in a cage? 
Some men call the stage 

Listen now I have gone 
You will know 
I was the only one that would have gladly died 
What was wrong in the eyes of the unwell and unwise 

They killed a man for his giro today 
Wasn't very game, I didn't mind 
I wasn't a money man anyway 
They killed a man for his giro today 

Why, would you pay 
Why, would you pay 
To see me in the cage 
Just a hole across the stage 

And know 
When the night has gone 
You might say 
I was not the only the one that would've died 
What was wrong in the eyes of the cruel and unwise 
And they killed a man for his giro today 

On the off chance that you're listening 
To the radio 
I thought you might like to know you broke my heart 
You can only start to know or hedge your bets 
And take a chance you never get again 
All my ties, time and time 
I keep on trying hard not to try too hard 
When I forgive, I won't forget 
To killing time, so I'm better now 
I don't need it anymore 
Anything that makes you, feel hate 
Can do without hate 
Now I believe in love 

Now I have gone 
Oh yeah, I will pay 
For everything you've done 
What was wrong 
In the eyes of the unwell and unwise 
They killed a man for his giro today 

Ohhh ohhh ohhhh
