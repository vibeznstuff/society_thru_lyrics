Ummmmmm, ummmmmmm


I don't wanna spend another day,
Pointing fingers while im placing blame,
Im no angel, imperfect myself, cos baby I am only human,
And I don't wanna put it all on you,
I admit I did some painful things its true,
And im sorry for them, no making amends,
For always thinking I was innocent


Starting today, im gunna change,
Don't wanna make the same mistakes,
Cos I can see a new horizon,
The ice around my heart is melting,
And the hurt I feel is slowly dying,
Now im, no longer crying,
The bridge we burnt is being built again,
Its leading to a new begining,
And it may never be the way it was, 
And thats because im talking about forgiveness,
Forgiveness, forgiveness, forgiveness,

 
I wish we could take back the things we said,
Cos what we saids not always what we ment,
We lost our heads, in the moment,
And the words we used them like a weapon,
But no one wins if we both walk away,
And we hid behind the people we became,
We're warmer than that, we're better than that,
And i still cherish all the things we had,


Starting today, im gunna change,
Don't wanna make the same mistakes,
Cos I can see a new horizon,
The ice around my heart is melting,
And the hurt I feel is slowly dying,
Now im, no longer crying,
The bridge we burnt is being built again,
Its leading to a new begining,
And it may never be the way it was, 
And thats because im talking about forgiveness,
Forgiveness, forgiveness, forgiveness


If everybody could forgive and forget (just forget),
Think of all the time that we could spend, being friends,
Think about all the lives we could change,
And all the love we could make,
Baby how the world would be a better place,
In the ennnndddd, ohhhhh,

 
Starting today, all that we will change,
And ill make the same mistakes, you know that,
I can see a new horizon,
The ice around my heart is melting,
And the hurt I feel is slowly dying,
And im no longer,
The bridge we burnt is being built again,
Its leading to a new begining,
And it may never be the way it was, 
And thats because im talking about forgiveness,
Forgiveness, forgiveness, forgiveness,

Forgiveness 


If everybody could just forgive,
The world would be a much better place,
 ohhhhh
Forgiveness
