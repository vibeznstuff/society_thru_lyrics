When the sun is up,
on a clear blue sky,
you will act like a lover
When the sky is grey,
and the rain comes down,
you will run for cover

Feel the heat, come out of cold,
and your arm is touching me

Good morning sunshine,
you're my only light
lying with me by my side,
you keep me warm all day
Just stay with me

Good morning sunshine,
be with me all day
Just don't let the rain pass you by
When it's cloudy and windy
and the snowflakes arrive,
you somehow just make me,
make me feel I'm alive

When you leave my field
then you light the stars
Fading away in horizon
there's a million streets
leading off the night,
waiting for sun to be risen

Feel the heat, come out of cold,
and your arm is touching me
Good morning sunshine,
you're my only light,
lying with me by my side,
you keep me warm all day
Just stay with me

Good morning sunshine,
be with me all day
Just don't let the rain pass you by
When it's cloudy and windy
and the snowflakes arrive,
you somehow just make me,
make me feel I'm alive

Hold it right there,
let me take a minute of your time,
to explain how I feel through these rhymes
I do the best I can, and believe me if I could
I'll build you a paradise with these two hands
the touch of your skin, makes my body go numb,
I'm thinking to myself, if my dream come true,
or is it 'cause you never give me a chance to tell you
how I feel, the moments we had were too precious to kill.

When it is cloudy and windy,
please turn your face at me

Good morning sunshine,
you're my only light,
lying with me by my side,
you keep me warm all day
Just stay with me

Good morning sunshine,
be with me all day,
Just don't let the rain pass you by,
when it is cloudy and windy
and the snowflakes arrive,
you somehow just make me,
make me feel I'm alive
make me feel I'm alive...
