Once upon a time not so long ago
This boy he took to the stage
He wandered around like a travelling show
But one thing filled him with rage
While singing the song that thawed his heart
People would walk to the bar
The lights would go down
The music would start
He couldn't get very far

Until one night...

Kick on the beat and bring on the bass
Everyone turn to look at my face
'Cause all I want
Is the best of order, baby.
My light goes on and your light goes down
Wouldn't you like to rock this town?
'Cause all I want 
Is the best of order, baby.

Now standing all alone 
Looking through the smoke
This kid he started to grin
He's tryin' ta compete with bingo and jokes
There's no use trying to win! 

Until one night...

Kick on the beat and bring on the bass
Everyone turn to look at my face
'Cause all I want
Is the best of order, baby.
My life is up when your life is down
Wouldn't you like to rock this town?
'Cause all I want 
Is the best of order, baby.

Kick on the beat and bring on the bass
Everyone turn to look at my face
'Cause all I want
Is the best of order, baby.
My life is up when your life is down
Wouldn't you like to rock this town?
'Cause all I want 
Is the best of order, baby.

You never even know what you're missing
Why doncha pay attention and listen?
Someone's tryin' ta blow your mind away!
Why doncha turn around and Im hoping
Two people in the front will stop groping
Someones tryin' ta blow your mind away! 

Kick on the beat and bring on the bass
Everyone turn to look at my face
'Cause all I want
Is the best of order, baby.
My life is up when your life is down
Wouldn't you like to rock this town?
'Cause all I want 
Is the best of order, baby.

Kick on the beat and bring on the bass
Everyone turn to look at my face
'Cause all I want
Is the best of order, baby.
My life is up when your life is down
Wouldn't you like to rock this town?
'Cause all I want 
Is the best of order, baby.

Kick on the beat and bring on the bass
Everyone turn to look at my face
'Cause all I want
Is the best of order, baby.
My life is up when your life is down
Wouldn't you like to rock this town?
'Cause all I want 
Is the best of order, baby.
