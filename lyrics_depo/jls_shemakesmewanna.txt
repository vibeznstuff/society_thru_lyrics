I cant explain what's gotten into me
My sanity is in the passenger seat
I let her drive me she is my guide
We’re flying reckless tonight

Direct me to the floor
And turn it up some more
Imma get it on on on on

Direct me to the floor
And turn it up some more
Imma get it on on on on

She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

London to jamaica
La to africa
She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

I think her eyes are hypnotizing me
Something about her turns me into a wild beast
I mesmerized, down for the ride
Flying reckless tonight

Direct me to the floor
And turn it up some more
Imma get it on on on on

Direct me to the floor
And turn it up some more
Imma get it on on on on

She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna

London to jamaica

Well that's kind of funny 
I-i was just thinking 
How you make me oh-oh-oh
 we’re flying over buildings 
Sitting under palm trees
 drinking bubble gum drinks 
We’re counting all our monies 
Dancing in ice rinks 
Buying icies
 (it’s nothing) 
We’re loving 
We’re worthy of this 
Look where I come from 
Now this world our kingdom

She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

London to jamaica
L.a to africa
She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
