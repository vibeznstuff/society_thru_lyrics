Metal Guru is it you
Metal Guru is it you
Sitting there in your armour plated chair

Metal Guru is it true
Metal Guru is it true
All alone without a telephone

Metal Guru could it be
You're gonna bring my baby to me
She'll be wild you know
A rock'n'roll child

Metal Guru has it been
Just like a silver-studded sabre-tooth dream
I'll be clean you know
Pollution machine
