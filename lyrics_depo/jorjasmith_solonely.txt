Feelin' out of touch
Lost my way
No one ever asked me why
Tried to move along
Never looking back
You're gonna come around in time

Alone
Alone
Alone now, my friend
Alone
Alone
Alone now, my friend

Talkin' to the wolves
But my shadow's gone
Too much time to pretend there's nothin' wrong

So lonely
So lonely
So lonely now, my friend
Oh so lonely
So lonely
So lonely now, my friend

I don't want to feel this way
Although it is true when they say, no
It's good for you to be alone, no
But you can't learn it all on your own, no

Lonely
So lonely
So lonely now, my friend
Lone, lonely
So lonely
So lonely has become my friend
