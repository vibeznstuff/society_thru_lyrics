Never mind the stars in the sky 
Never mind the when and the why 
Got a feeling higher than high 
This is the real thing

No more living in shame
And I'm not gonna run or gonna hide away 
No more telling all those lies
It's been too long

No more living in chains
No, I don't give a damn whet the people say
There's no use holding back desire
We've burnt our fingers now lets jump into the flames

Never mind the stars in the sky 
Never mind the when and the why 
Got a feeling higher than high
This is the real thing
Never mind the rain and the storm 
We'll keep each other warm
We got something stronger than strong 
This is the real thing

Gonna walk out hand in hand
So let them criticise 'cos they don't understand 
We've got nothing to hide
It's just love

I've had enough of shy
So let's go out and show them what we have inside
There's no use holding back desire
We've burnt our fingers now let's jump into tho fire

Never mind the stars in the sky 
Never mind the when and the why 
Got a feeling higher than high
This is the real thing
Never mind the rain and the storm 
We'll keep each other warm
We got something stronger than strong 
This is the real thing

Never mind the stars in the sky baby
Never mind the when and the why baby 
Never mind the stars in the sky baby
'Cos I've got a feeling that's higher than high

Oh, what you do to me, baby
Oh, what you do to me, baby

This is the real thing

Never mind the stars in the sky 
Never mind the when and the why 
Got a feeling higher than high
This is the real thing
Never mind the rain and the storm 
We'll keep each other warm
We got something stronger than strong 
This is the real thing

Never mind the stars in the sky baby
Never mind the when and the why baby 
Never mind the stars in the sky baby
'Cos I've got a feeling that's higher than high

Never mind the stars in the sky 
Never mind the when and the why 
Got a feeling higher than high
This is the real thing
Never mind the rain and the storm 
We'll keep each other warm
We got something stronger than strong 
This is the real thing
