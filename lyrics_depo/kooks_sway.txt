Say whatever you have to say, I'll stand by you.
Do whatever you have to do, to get it out and not become a reaction memory
To hurt the ones you love you know you never meant to but you do
oh yeah you do

Be whoever you have to be, I won't judge you
Sing whatever you have to sing to get it out and not become a recluse about you, how to come out
I know you never meant to but you do
oh but you do

Still I need your sway, because you always pay for it
And I, and I need your soul because you're always soulful
And I and I need your heart, because you're always in the right places

And take whatever you have to take, you know I love you
come however you have to come, and get it out and get it out

Take it out on me, take it out on me
I'll give it you all, I give it you all,i give it
I give you all I give it you all, yes I will give it you all

Cause I need your sway, because you always pay for it
And I, and I need your soul because you're always soulful
And I and I need your heart, because you're always in the right places

Oh yes I will, I will give it you all

Cause I need your sway, because you always pay for it
And I, and I need your soul because you're always soulful
And I and I need that heart, because you're always in the right places.
