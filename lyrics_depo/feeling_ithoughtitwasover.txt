Well, you were there when the wall came down
A baby king with a grown man's crown
And we played in the sun as the curtain was crumbling

Well, I was young and I could not see
That if you go, won't you please take me?
And you told me that I would forget you eventually
(And I nearly did)
Yeah, yeah

I thought it was over but it's not
I thought it was over but it's not
I'm spinning in circles, I can't stop
I thought it was over but it's not

I'm in love with a fool
And you don't know what you've lost
It hurts from the bottom to the top
I thought it was over but it's not, yeah

Another year and the job was done
The old republic was dead and gone
And the new way of living would be a reality

But it's a while since you shut that door
I lie awake, ain't asleep no more
Though the nightmare is gone now I don't have a dream
(I don't have a dream)

I thought it was over but it's not
I thought it was over but it's not
I'm spinning in circles, I can't stop
I thought it was over but it's not

I'm in love with a fool
And you don't know what you've lost
It hurts from the bottom to the top
I thought it was over but it's not

Does anybody know?
Does anybody know?
Does anybody know?
Does anybody know?

I thought it was over but it's not
I thought it was over but it's not
I'm spinning in circles, I can't stop
I thought it was over but it's not

I'm in love with a fool
And you don't know what you've lost
It hurts from the bottom to the top
I thought it was over but it's not
