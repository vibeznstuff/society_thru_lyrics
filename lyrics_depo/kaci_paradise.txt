Could it be the little
Things you do to me
Feelings that I'm feeling
Are so new to me
I'm going through
So many changes
Nothing ever felt
As strange as
How my heart goes
Crazy when you
Look at me-oh


When I'm with you
Its paradise
No place on Earth
Could be so nice
Through the crystal waterfalls
I hear you call
Just take my hand
Its paradise
You kiss me once
I'll kiss you twice
And as I gaze
Into your eyes
I realise its paradise

Now I know the
Sweetest dreams can
All come true
'Cause I found Heaven
Here on earth
When I found you
Its nothing I could
Ever make up
How I hope
I never wake up
Just to find this
Isn't true reality



The world around just
Disappears without a trace
Telling me that I have
Found the perfect place
Let it stay this way forever
Deep in love and may
I never
Spend another day
Without you close to me

Ooh paradise
Yeah

Oh just take my hand
Its paradise
You kiss me once
I'll kiss you twice
And as I gaze
Into your eyes
I realise its paradise



Ooh paradise
