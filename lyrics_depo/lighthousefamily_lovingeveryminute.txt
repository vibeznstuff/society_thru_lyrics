You told me not to make you wait
Then you don't call for days
You told me not to be too late
Then you don't come to me

How many times you're gonna let me down
You're keeping me hanging on as if i'm
Wrapped around your finger
Never believed that I'd ever find myself
Looking up to the upper hand and
Loving every minute baby

I won't mind, ain't gonna give up as long as I know my own mind

Don't wanna quit after all this time
I won't mind, ain't gonna give up as long as I know my own mind

Don't wanna quit after all this time

Totally you lost the way you came
Rainbow coloured day opened out the way you changed

Then it all starts to fade

How many times you're gonna let me down
Your keeping me hanging on as if i'm
Wrapped around your finger
Never believed that I'd ever find myself
Looking up to the upper hand and
Loving every minute baby

I won't mind, ain't gonna give up as long as I know my own mind

Don't wanna quit after all this time
I won't mind, ain't gonna give up as long as I know my own mind

Don't wanna quit after all this time

How many times you're gonna let me down
You're keeping me hanging on as if i'm
Wrapped around your finger
Never believed that I'd ever find myself
Looking up to the upper hand and
Loving every minute baby

I won't mind, ain't gonna give up as long as I know my own mind

Don't wanna quit after all this time
I won't mind, ain't gonna give up as long as I know my own mind

Don't wanna quit after all this time
