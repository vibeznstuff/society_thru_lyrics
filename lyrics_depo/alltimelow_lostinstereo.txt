Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo

She works for the weekend, mixtape of her favorite bands
Tearin' up the radio lost in the stereo sound

She's trouble in a tank top pretty little time bomb
Blowing up I'll take you down
Living in the radio lost in the stereo sound

She's dancing alone, I'm ready to go but she's so
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)
She's out of control, so beautiful
(In stereo, lost in stereo)
And I've been waiting for so long but she'll never know
I'm losing hope 'cause she's so
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)

Whoa, whoa
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)

Shake down on a Saturday
Sit back gotta catch my breath
'Cause every time I see her I know she's gonna take it back somehow

Tattoos and a switchblade attitude
Snakebite heart with a bubblegum smile
Sex in stereo don't turn the radio dial

She's dancing alone, I'm ready to go but she's so
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)
She's out of control, so beautiful
(In stereo, lost in stereo)
And I've been waiting for so long but she'll never know
I'm losing hope 'cause she's so
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)

And I'm just like cellophane 'cause she sees right through me
I know she's glitter and gold
And that's just the price I pay when I don't even know her name
She's slipping away

She works for the weekend, mixtape of her favorite bands
Tearin' up the radio lost in the stereo sound

She's dancing alone, I'm ready to go but she's so
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)
She's out of control, so beautiful
(In stereo, lost in stereo)
And I've been waiting for so long but she'll never know
I'm losing hope 'cause she's so
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)

She's dancing alone, I'm ready to go but she's so
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)
She's out of control, so beautiful
(In stereo, lost in stereo)
And I've been waiting for so long but she'll never know
I'm losing hope 'cause she's so
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)
