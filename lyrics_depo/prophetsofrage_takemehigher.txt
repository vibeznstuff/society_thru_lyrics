Yo Chuck, is that a drone up there, man?
They fly over, they fly over
Let me go get Timmy C's gun and shoot it out the fuckin' sky
Look out when they all come down

Drones
They got ya tapped, they got ya phone
Lookout
Drones
They got ya trapped, they spot your home
'Cause you're a target


I've been one for years
I'm never in fear
Standing up with my peers
Makin' these tears rain down
Like a monsoon
Listen to the streets go boom
Explosion
Emotion
Fight the power and
Over the fuckin' injustice I'm towering
Feds no props when I drop these lyrics that'll make ya say
Fuck the cops

Drones
They got ya tapped, they got ya phone
Lookout
Drones
They got ya trapped, they spot your home
'Cause you're a target


Drones gonna take you out
Drones gonna shut your mouth
Drones flying checking y'all out
Drones in the hood like wow
Coming from the airport hangar
Hanging heads certified bangers
Branch of government gangsters
Programmed by government strangers

Take me higher 

Take me higher 

Drones
They got ya tapped, they got ya phone
Lookout
Drones
They got ya trapped, they spot your home
'Cause you're a target


Drones gonna take you out, yeah
Drones gonna take you out, huh
Drones gonna take you out, uh
Drones in the hood like, wow, uh
