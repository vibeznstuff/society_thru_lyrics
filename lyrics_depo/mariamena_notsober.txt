It starts with a quiver
A thought-provoked shiver
A fear I can't deliver
They don't need me, they don't need me
The comfort of my home
Now feels like a prison
My thoughts lacking reason
No one loves me, no one loves me

I am afraid of the dark
When I am alone with my thoughts
So here's to avoid falling apart
I'm not sober, yeah
I'm not sober
I'm not sober

I lie 'cause I'm shameful
My movements weak, I stall
A complete loss of control
I'm a failure, I'm a failure
It's like taking the beating
Hung from the ceiling
Your fear is only a feeling
But it's painful
Why's it painful?

I am afraid of the dark
When I am alone with my thoughts
So here's to avoid falling apart
I'm not sober, yeah
I'm not sober

I am afraid of the dark
When I am alone with my thoughts
So here's to avoid falling apart
I'm not sober, yeah
I'm not sober

It starts with a quiver
A thought-provoked shiver
A fear I can't deliver
They don't need me, they don't need me
