Over
Come over 

In the dark the dance begins
The night is starting to sway
Feel the beat of ecstasy inside your soul
Pumping hard

I make believe that love is real 
And lets us take control
Let's be dangerous if only for one mo-ment

Come.. and kiss my eyes
Come.. and kiss my eyes
Over come we're overcome
Come we're overcome

Over
Come over 

In the dark the magic spins and we forget the day
Feel the rush of energy inside your soul
One 2 one
I'll take a chance that love is here
And love is all we know
We're wa-tching one another
Let's be dangerous live only for the moment

Come.. and kiss my eyes
Come.. and kiss my eyes
Over come we're overcome
Come we're overcome
Come.. mmm...
Come.. and kiss my eyes
Come.. and kiss my eyes
Over come we're overcome
Come we're overcome
Come.. come...come
