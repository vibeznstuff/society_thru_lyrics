Heartache number nine - heartache number nine -

You look like a dream
But it's obscence the way you play your game.
You treat them like a number without a name.
Lovers used
Their hearts abused
I'm gone without a trace.
Don't you know it's time to mend your ways?

Don't wanna be heartache number nine -
I'm not gonna play that part.
I'm gonna be the one to change your mind

You're never gonna break my heart.

When I'm down I'll be the only one

I'll never be known as heartache number nine.
One to three were way before me

And four was a friend of mine -
They fail for your lies time after time.
Five and six were here and gone
They didn't last too long

And seven and eight were next in line.

Don't wanna be heartache number nine ...

It's been eight times that love's walked in and out of your life

But it's all in the past 'cause I'm here to stay
Oh baby.

Heartache number nine - heartache number nine -
When I'm down I'll be the only one

I'll never be known as heartache number nine.

Heartache number nine ...
