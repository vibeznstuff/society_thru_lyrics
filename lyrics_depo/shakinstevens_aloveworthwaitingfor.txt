If you should ever want to be set free
If you're not certain your future lies with me
I'll let you go girl until your heart is sure
It's a love worth waiting for.

Now I won't stop you from leaving 'cos I know
The way to keep you would be to let you go.
And I'm prepared to wait a thousand years or more
It's a love worth waiting for.

If you should leave me oh please remember

In my heart there's a fire a flame of desire for your charms.

I will keep you alive this glowing ember.
A love that will burn until you're back in my arms.

You know my darling
I need you here with me

But only to stay because it's where you ought to be.
'Cos I'm prepared to wait a thousand years or more

It's a love worth waiting for.
In my heart there's a fire a flame of desire for your charms.

A love that will burn until you're back in my arms.

You know my darling

I need you here with me

It's a love worth waiting for.
