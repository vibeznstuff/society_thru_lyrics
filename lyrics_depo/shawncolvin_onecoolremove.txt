One cool remove
One cool remove
And forever let me stay
One cool remove away

One cool remove
One cool remove
See it all in a passion play
One cool remove away


One cool remove from the white sun,
Rising like a cloud above the land.
One cool remove from the red moon,
Falling like a hand.

One cool remove
One cool remove
And neither come nor go nor stay
One cool remove away.



One cool remove
One cool remove
And neither come nor go nor stay
One cool remove away.
