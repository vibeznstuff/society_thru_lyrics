When you're a boy
Some days are tough
Lying on your bad
Playing punk rock and stuff
Home is a boot camp
You gotta escape
Wanna go and wander
In the ticker-tape

You feel the deal is real
You're a New York City boy
So young, so run
Into New York City

New York City boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

The street is amazing
The hoochies unreal
Check out all the hardware
At the latest deal
Hear a song
That's the bomb
If you don't get the mix
It's got eighty-six

You feel the deal is real
You're in New York City

New York City boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway
New York city boy
This is your reward day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

Then as the evening falls
You can return its calls

You feel the deal is real
You're a New York City boy
So young, so run
Into New York City

New York City boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway
