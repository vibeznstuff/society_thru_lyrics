There was a time, you had it made
Everything was going your way
So many guys hanging on a string
You just wanted to play

Like a spy in the house of love
Searching for a clue in the dark
Spy in the house of love
Someone put a spell on your heart
Spy in the house of love
Searching for a clue in the dark
Spy in the house of love
Someone's got a hold of your heart
Spy, baby, in the house of love
Spy, baby, in the house of love

Out on the street, you were the queen
Playing games with jokers and fools
Then out of the night there comes the king
Now he's changing the rules
