Scratching like a tom cat, got a monkey on my back
I'm gonna push and pull and howl like wolf
And drive my cadillac
I've got medication, honey, I've got wings to fly
I've got horse hoof tea to buzz you like a bee
Gonna blind the evil eye
Push and pull with me, funky jamming free
Walk it like you talk it, honey, strut your funky stuff, come on

I'm yours, you're mine, gimme more of that Jailbird pie
I'm yours, you're mine, gimme more of that Jailbird pie
I'm yours, you're mine, gimme more of that Jailbird pie
I'm yours, you're mine, yeah, yeah, yeah

Come in my kitchen, I've got hop head soup for grease
Just shake your hips and let it rip
And let the spirit free
Ride on baby, ride on, let your crazy horses loose
Give it all you got when you're hot to trot
And wave bye bye to the blues
Shake it to the east, shake it to the west
Shake it with the very one that you love the best, come on

I'm yours, you're mine, gimme more of that Jailbird pie
I'm yours, you're mine, gimme more of that Jailbird pie
I'm yours, you're mine, gimme more of that Jailbird pie
I'm yours, you're mine, yeah, yeah, yeah, all right

(I'm yours, you're mine) Gimme more of that Jailbird pie
(I'm yours, you're mine) Gimme more of that Jailbird pie
(I'm yours, you're mine) Gimme more of that Jailbird pie
(I'm yours, you're mine) Gimme more of that Jailbird pie
(I'm yours, you're mine) Gimme more of that Jailbird pie
(I'm yours, you're mine) Gimme more of that Jailbird pie
(I'm yours, you're mine) Gimme more of that Jailbird pie
