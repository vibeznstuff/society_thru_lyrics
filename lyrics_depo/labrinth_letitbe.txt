Put my money where my mouth is
And I laid my cards
I'm a go out fightin' and leave my scars
I don't know about tomorrow
But I know I got heart

Put my feet right on the margin
And I just might hit the bottom
Throw my hands out on the breeze
And let it be

(Let it be)
(Let it be)

Baby this is Russian roulette
And it ain't my gun
Hallelujah I ain't dead yet
And I'm still going strong (oh oh oh)
I don't know about tomorrow
But the bottle ain't done

They say losers are forgotten
And I just might hit the bottom
But we all gotta take the leap and let it be

(Let it be) Oh let it be
(Let it be) Oh let it be
(Let it be) Just let it be, oh oh oh oh
(Let it be) Just let it be, baby

It's all been said and done
Oh I've done and said it all
Hope and pray
I think it's time to catch that train
I don't know where it starts
And I don't know where it ends
I guess that's the name of the game, oh no

Oh, got to let it go
Yeah, I got to let it go, yeah
Woh, let it be
Woh no oh no, let it be

(Let it be) C'mon oh, c'mon oh
(Let it be) Let it be, baby
(Let it be)

When you're holding on your last breath
When you're looking for a way out
No no no
Woh let it be
(Let it be)

Let it be
Let it be
Let it be
Just let it be
