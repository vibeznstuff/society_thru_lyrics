Once there was a way
Once there was a time
When evrything was in its place and simply fine.
When no one bothered counting all the tears one cried in vain
For in the morning
More than likely one would shine again

Take me high
Love

Take me high
Take me back to where I've been
Take me high
Love

Let me fly-y love

In the skyways I once knew
Take me back to the days
When I was truly never alone
Take me high
Love

Take me home.

Once there was a hill
Once there was a tree
Once there was a bird
Who spread its wings and flew
To places we imagine so much brighter than our own
Yet when the summer sun and returned our feathered friends came home.

Take me high
Love

Take me high

Take me high
Love

Take me home
Take me high
Love
Take me home.
