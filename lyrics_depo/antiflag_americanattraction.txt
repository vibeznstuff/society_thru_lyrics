Yeah

There's no escaping the American attraction
A bait and switch that's gonna thrill you with distraction
It sounds so good, you can't resist the satisfaction
When it's all over you'll be crying, I'll be laughing

Yeah

I got that gun, got that drug
I've got everything you want
Got that bomb, got that blood
I've got everything you're not
It's the American attraction
It's the American attraction

The clock tick-tick-tick-ticking down to a disaster
Your insecurity is all they're coming after
This propaganda so impossible to resist
Where ideology replaces being honest

I got that gun, got that drug
I've got everything you want
Got that bomb, got that blood
I've got everything you're not
It's the American attraction
It's the American attraction

You think it's a circus the truth is it's a strategy
American beauty twisted into a tragedy
Out in a blaze of glory

You got your gun, got your drug
You got your bomb, got your blood
And now we've had enough

I got that gun, got that drug
I've got everything you want
Got that bomb, got that blood
I've got everything you're not
It's the American attraction
It's the American attraction
It's the American attraction
It's the American attraction

Yeah
