You hide it everytime you miss,
Impatience waits around for me,
You dance under the question mark,
Without even trying.

I'm just not sure it's gonna work,
I'm just not sure it's gonna work.

You can burn it all,
Rally around the table if you want to,
Just to argue out the last scenes of us,
You can end it all,
I'm sorry enough to tell you that I'm okay and I'm never gonna see you again

The killers walking amongst us,
Look around they'll find your ashes,
You cradle over your mistakes,
And every heart you'll ever break

I'm just not sure it's gonna work,
I'm just not sure it's gonna work.

You can burn it all,
Rally around the table if you want to,
Just to argue out the last scenes of us,
You can end it all,
I'm sorry enough to tell you that I'm okay and I'm never gonna see you again, AGAIN!!

You stumble through questions that you could never answer,
The barrel is loaded so go and paint your target 

You can burn it all,
Rally around the table if you want to,
Just to argue out the last scenes of us,
You can end it all,
I'm sorry enough to tell you that I'm okay and I'm never gonna see you again.


So elegant you stumble around
With beautiful falls
