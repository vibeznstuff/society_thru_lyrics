Here in the hush of evenin' on a night in June
Overhearin' conversations bayin' at the moon
Suddenly a voice I'm hearin's sweet to my ear
This is tomorrow's callin', wishin' you were here

Layin' in my hotel bedroom, feelin' ceilin' blues
Wall to wall a TV's twitchin', clearly not a muse
Then flashin' through the interference beams a thousand tunes
This is tomorrow callin', what have I to lose?

Truckin' by the railway station, I'm on the road again
Steerin' clear of all temptation unto the point of pain
When steamin' through on cue I hear that wailin' whistle blow
If this is tomorrow callin', oh, what a way to go

Oho

Day to day you live old fashioned, hi-toned, fancy free
A double take, an image-spittin', tailored to a T
While history is tellin' you the same old thing
This is tomorrow callin', let's stick a new oar in

This is tomorrow callin', y'all 'n come on in
