She's a good girl, loves her mama
Loves Jesus and America, too
She's a good girl, crazy 'bout Elvis
Loves horses and her boyfriend, too, yeah, yeah

It's a long day living in reseda
There's a freeway runnin' through the yard
I'm a bad boy 'cause I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breaking her heart

And I'm free, free fallin', fallin'
And I'm free, free fallin', fallin'

All the vampires walkin' through the valley
They move west down Ventura boulevard
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows
And the good girls are home with broken hearts

And I'm free, free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free, free fallin', fallin'

Free fallin',
Now I'm free fallin',
Now I'm free fallin',
Now I'm free fallin',
Now I'm free fallin',
Now I'm free fallin',
Now I'm free fallin',
Now I'm free fallin'.

I wanna glide down over Mulholland
I wanna write her, her name in the sky
I wanna free fall out into nothin'
Oh, I'm gonna leave this, this world for a while

Now I'm free, free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free, free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free, free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free, free fallin', fallin'
Free fallin', fallin'
Free fallin', fallin'
Free fallin', fallin'
