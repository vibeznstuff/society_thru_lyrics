Tell me are you feeling strong
Strong enough to love someone
And make it through the hardest storm
And bad weather

Will you pull me from the flames
Hold me till I feel no pain
And give me shelter from the rain
Forever

Where can I find her

She took the light and left me in the dark (eah)
She left me with a broken heart (eah)
Now I'm on my own
If anybody sees her

Eh, eh, eh shine a light on her
Eh, eh, eh shine a light on her
Eh, eh, eh shine a light on her
Eh, eh, if anybody sees her

Tell me can you hear my voice
Loud and clear above the noise
And even if I had the choice
I would not give up

Where can I find her

She took the light and left me in the dark (eah)
She left me with a broken heart (eah)
Now I'm on my own
If anybody sees her

Eh, eh, eh shine a light on her
Eh, eh, eh shine a light on her
Eh, eh, eh shine a light on her
Eh, eh, if anybody sees her

Eh, eh, eh shine a light on her
Eh, eh, eh shine a light on her
Eh, eh, eh shine a light on her
Eh, eh, if anybody sees her

She took the light and left me in the dark (eah)
She left me with a broken heart (eah)
Now I'm on my own
If anybody sees her

Eh, eh, eh shine a light on her
Eh, eh, eh shine a light on her
Eh, eh, eh shine a light on her
Eh, eh, if anybody sees her

Eh, eh, eh shine a light on her
Eh, eh, eh shine a light on her
Eh, eh, eh shine a light on her
Eh, eh, if anybody sees her
