There's a feeling in your stomach a light trembling at the knees
Not even knowing who the luck fellow might be
Bridesmaids are cleaning the court-house bell
Horse-driven carriages wait patiently in hell

Happiness has been arranged for some time in July
Invitations have been sent I'm so bitter I could cry
Congratulations flown in from a long-lost friend
For the big occasion regretting that he can't attend
And as family tradition is busy making up your mind
Gallantly standing draped in his holy shroud
God's representative mumbles to a tearful crowd

I now pronounce you
I now pronounce you

Mother father wake up you've overlooked one thing
The daughter you planned for for years
Won't get to wear your ring
Instead she'll be running off into the dark of night
Straight into hungry arms that long to hold her tight
And as family tradition is busy making up your mind
Gallantly standing draped in his holy shroud
God's representative mumbles to a tearful crowd

I now pronounce you
I now pronounce you

There's a feeling deep inside of you a feeling that of ease
You're the sweetest thing that could ever happen for me
Bridesmaids are cleaning the court-house bell
Horse-driven carriages wait patiently in hell
Gallantly standing draped in his holy shroud
God's representative mumbles to a tearful crowd

I now pronounce you
I now pronounce you
