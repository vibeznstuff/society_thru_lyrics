So I stepped to her like I knew her
Introduced her to Jacob the jeweler

I don't do too many skinny or the runway frail
Thick with it is how we like it in the ATL
Sick with it, pants low with a real wide load
As soon as you hit the door everybody was like whoa
I bet it's hard for you to go to the mall and buy clothes
Cause your waist is so little and your ass is like whoa 
You poppin' that thing like a Luke video
Mesmerized by the sound and the way the flutes blow
Drink in my right hand, another in my left
Crew right behind me screamin So So Def
Now forgive me if I'm sturring
But I gotta no 1 thing
How in the hell did you get all that in those jeans
I'm behind you grindin
more than the Clipse
I aint never seen nobody pop they booty like dis
What I'm saying is
What you doing is major, the way you keep
Shaking, shaking, shaking what cha momma gave ya


Mami dancing all on me
She's not wearing any panties (ok)
I like it when she call me dadda
The way she pops it like she from Jamaica 

 
I love the way you move so sexy
I love when you are all up on me
But there's one thing I have to see (the one thing I have to see) 
Is the way you pop that booty (is the way you pop that booty)
I love the way you move so sexy
I love when you all up on me
Girl take the floor and you'll see
Let me see you pop that booty
