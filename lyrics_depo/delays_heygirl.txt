Hey girl 
Where in the world
Did you come from
Hey girl where in the world
Do you belong
(I said) 
Hey girl watching you
Walk is like a dream
Hey girl you got a nerve and
You sure got 
Me

As I wanted, singing lost and found
Like a fever running,
We could clear this 
Town

(I said) Hey girl where in the world
Did you come from
Hey girl nobody knows where 
You belong

So why don't you tell me
You're hanging above me
There's room 
Everywhere
And I can't walk on air

Hey girl

(I said) Hey girl where in the 
World
Did you come from
Hey girl never return cause you belong

I said Hey 
Girl...
