When I met you, you were so unique
Had a little thing I'd love to keep
Every movement carried so much mystique
I knew right then I'd carry on, to you I knew my heart belonged 
You, you give me something
Something that nobody else can give
See my heart, has started thumpin'
You're the one I truly know I dig 

Like the sunbeams from a perfect summer's day
Heaven only seems a step away
When I'm with you, I just celebrate
I'm hoping my message gets through
There's never been someone like you 

I had nobody, on you I would lean
Cos you got these little things that
I know I've never seen 

You, you give me something
Something that nobody else has got
And this love, that I've been wanting
Oh baby's turning out too fast to stop 

You, you give me something
Something that nobody else can give
See my heart has started thumpin'
You're the one I truly know I dig
