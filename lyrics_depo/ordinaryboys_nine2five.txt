(La la la...)
I wake up late every morning
managers calling I'm still yawning
Get up wake up hair and makeups
Waiting for you don't be sawing
This performance is important
I don't think I can put my all in
Hold on i was drunk last night
Now its all kicking in and I don't feel right
Gave my number to a breh who wasn't my type
Now my phones on silent I'm being polite
Now private numbers get no love from me
Just let me be


Oh my gosh my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back, I'm working a 9 to 5
Just to keep my contract did I say I meant 1:30
I'm no early birdy I'm working a 9 to 5

(la la la...)

So you gottado sum ite for channel u
Channel who sorry who I'm altered for snooze
Oh! Channel U the ones that made me huge
Like Katie Prices boobs
Whoops I'm being rude
Wheres my red bull and my sandwich i need food
I cant handle this
I'm getting pissed like pampers throwing a tantrum
Action

I'm not sure what day just started
Since my working week departed
Ever since I single charted
This persuits be ever lasted
I clocked in about a year ago
And I haven't clocked out from the studio
And videos and TV shows
And staring at the window on the road
And though sometimes we don't get paid for these rampages on these stages
I know that I won't get jaded
I won't go back to the minimum wages
