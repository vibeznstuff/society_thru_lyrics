I love you
You love her
There's nothing I can do
It was in my destiny to fall for you

You say you
Could never give
Me a love that's true
It was in my destiny to fall for you
And there ain't a thing I can do about it
You know I can't live without it
All I can say is hey hey hey
I love you

You say why
Don't I try
To find someone new
It was in my destiny to fall for you
To fall for you
Think I'm falling for you
Da da da da da da da
There ain't a thing I can do about it
You know I can't live without it
All I can say is hey hey hey
I love you
