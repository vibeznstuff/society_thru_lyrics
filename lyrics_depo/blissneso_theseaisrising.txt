And all I know is the sun is shining, yet we fight all through the night
While the 'burgs are melting and the sea is rising, I don't know so I ask them why

Yeah, why are they refusing to listen, why are these troops on a mission
Why are they shooting these victims, over their view of religion
Yet why do we all search for love like we got cupid's addiction
Why with politicians, you can't tell the truth from the fiction
Why do we pollute where were living, why are these youth put at risk and
Why has this ruling dominion kept us consumed in this prison

Na na na, I won't jump through the hoops of the system
Nothing stands between you and the pursuit of your vision
I grab a loop of this rhythm, it puts the juice in my pistons
To jump back, react, spit in the booth with precision
And when I'm cruising with Izm, yeah I'm deucing a spliff and
It's BnE show, bitch, getting loose was a given
I don't want them to look back when the future is written
And know we killed ourselves with nuclear fission and stupid decisions
Shit, I'd rather an asteroid doomed for collision
Then know the planet got fucked by the human condition,
Sing the tune with conviction

And all I know is the sun is shining, yet we fight all thought the night
While the 'burgs are melting and the sea is rising
I don't know so I ask them why
And all I know is the sun is shining, yet we fight all through the night
Well if you don't know, shit, and I don't know
I guess all we can do is ask them why

Yeah, I'm an old school poet

Yeah, yo, yo

Yo, I'm an old school poet, I cherish the ink
That cosmic cowboy that doesn't care what they think
Real magic isn't card tricks. big cribs and cars, bitch
It's making something out of nothing through this hardship
And even though that the earth is weak
We still bomb each other and idol what the churches speak
It's like this land is either run by labour or liberal
But don't get it twisted, they're the same as the criminals
So open your eyes, simply notice the issue
That we stuck to our guns without promoting a pistol
And we orchestrated the sound that we all love
Split because of colour, but bound because of blood
So before we all blow and they sell the scene
Know that the only thing that's bullet proof's my self esteem
See this is way beyond cash and ego tripping
It's an epic, electric, Eso, ecosystem, grow with me

And all I know is the sun is shining, yet we fight all thought the night
While the 'burgs are melting and the sea is rising
I don't know so I ask them why
And all I know is the sun is shining, yet we fight all through the night
Well if you don't know, shit, and I don't know
I guess all we can do is ask them why

I don't have to tell you things are bad
Everybody knows things are bad
Air pollution's rising; the icecaps are melting quick
Kids trust no one; because fire burns
The air is unfit to breathe, our food is unfit to eat
It's an inferno in there,
Air pollution's rising; the icecaps are melting quick

Fuck your race riots, Fuck all that shit;
We are all here together in this country, as fucking one
As one
It's all about peace, love and unity
Sing it; peace, love and unity
Sing it

(Peace, love, unity)

And all I know is the sun is shining, yet we fight all thought the night
While the 'burgs are melting and the sea is rising
I don't know so I ask them why
And all I know is the sun is shining, yet we fight all through the night
Well if you don't know, shit, and I don't know
I guess all we can do is ask them why
