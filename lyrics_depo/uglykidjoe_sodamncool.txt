I wanna know, why the people are everywhere... and...
I wanna know, where to go if I get scared... and...
I wanna be, in a place where no one cares, and...

I, I, I wanna know you!
cause youre so damn cool!
Yeah, youre so damn cool!

I wanna feel like Im floatin in the air... and...
I wanna know if the sunss gonna bleach my hair... and
I wanna know why lifes so unfair and...

I wanna know you!
Because youre so damn cool!
Yeah, youre so damn cool!

Who knows what Im feelin inside of me!
And who knows if Im feelin all right!
Who knows what Im feelin inside of me
Who knows what is runnin around in my brain

Now that Im done and I seen it
And dont think that Im tryin to complain
Dont think Im lyin cause I mean it
N all you people out there dont look at me to lay
All of your blame cause you need me
And you want me to go down
In flames with the rest
But Im so sick of denyin
What is runnin around in my brain
