If I were you
I'd better watch out
When was the last time
You did anything
Not for me
Or any one else
Just because?
Just because?
You, you really should have known
Yeah you, you really should have known
Just because
Just because

You got the most
But nobody loves you
Nobody has to
Just because
Just because

You, you really should have known
Yeah you, I think you really should have known
Just because
Just because

When we first met
We passed around gifts
That was a long time ago
And yours didn''t fit

Yeah you, you really should have known
Yeah you, oh you really should have known
Just because
Just because
Just because
