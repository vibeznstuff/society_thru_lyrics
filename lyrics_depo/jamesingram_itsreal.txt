I...
The feeling 
Real
Hey hey
Talking about the feeling 

It's real, real, real, real
It's real, real, real, real
It's real, real, real, real
It's real, real, real, real

Girl, I see your body dancing on the floor
The funk is really thumping
Makes you want some more
All night long 
I've been waiting to get to you
I had to wait 'til they stopped this groove

You know it's true
It makes you move
It snaps your fingers to the groove
The time is right
It makes you want to dance all night, baby

It's real, real, real, real
It's real, real, real, real
Baby, it's real, real, real, real
Oh, it's real, real, real, real

All the fly girls and all the fly guys
Rocking to the music
Cause the beat is live
The music is so sweet
The beat is from the street
You know you know what's the deal

Baby, you know it's true
It makes you move
It snaps your fingers to the groove
The time is right
It makes you want to dance all night, baby

It's real, real, real, real
So, it's real, real, real, real
Baby, it's real, real, real, real
So real, real, real, real

Baby, it's real 
It's real, real, real, real
It's real, real, real, real
Baby, it's real, real, real, real
Oh, it's real, real, real, real

Real, real, real, real
Baby, it's real
So real 
So real

Hey baby it's real

Baby let's talk about it
Baby let's talk about it
