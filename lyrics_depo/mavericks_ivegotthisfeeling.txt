I saw you out the other night
I thought you'd be with him
I guess things didn't turn out right

I tried to call you on the phone
But you weren't there
Did you get tired of being alone

I've got this feeling inside
Tomorrow will turn out alright
'Cause I'll have you here by my side
To hold you and love you
With all of my might

You told me you were over him
And I believed in you
And now he wants you back again

He tried to call you on the phone
But you weren't there
He's probably tired of being alone

I've got this feeling inside
Tomorrow will turn out alright
'Cause I'll have you here by my side
To hold you and love you
With all of my might

I've got this feeling inside
Tomorrow will turn out alright
'Cause I'll have you here by my side
To hold you and love you
With all of my might

I've got this feeling inside
Tomorrow will turn out alright
'Cause I'll have you here by my side
To hold you and love you
With all of my might

Hey, baby, you know I love you
To hold you and love you
With all of my might
