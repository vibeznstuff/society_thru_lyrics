Amanda was a small town blonde haired beauty 
She had Heaven in her eyes and could light up a room 
When she walked into view, she was the prettiest girl in my school 
And I knew she'd never give me the time of day 
No girls like her ever looked twice my way 
She was out of my league 
Oh, but that was alright with me 

Cause I loved her from a distance 
Like an angel watching from afar 
I never had the nerve to mention 
The fire burning in my heart 
I knew a boy like me never woulda stood a chance 
So I did the best I could 
And I loved her from a distance 

The Homecoming dance of our senior year 
I finally got my courage up enough to overcome my fears 
I would have asked her to dance 
But her boyfriend never gave me a chance 
Every step of every song they swung the night away 
And I wish I could have wrapped my arms around her waist 
And told her how I cared 
Instead I only stood there and stared 

But I kept loving her from a distance 
Like an angel watching from afar 
I never had the nerve to mention 
The fire burning in my heart 
I knew a boy like me never woulda stood a chance 
So I did the best I could 
And I loved her from a distance 

The other night I saw her, first time in years 
My heart skipped a beat when she came walking near 
In those faded blue jeans 
She's still the prettiest girl I've seen 
And much to my surprise she said hello 
And that she loved listening to me singing on the radio 
I said that's a funny funny thing 
Cause your in every song I sing 

Yes I've been loving you from a distance 
Since you were only seventeen 
But I never had the nerve to mention 
The feelings flowing inside me 
I knew a boy like me never woulda stood a chance 
So I poured my heart into the music that I made 
And I kept loving you from a distance 

Oh and now we have a story book romance 
And I know one thing's for sure 
This love can go the distance
