Hey, I said you were Godless then
It seems like you're a soulless friend.
As thoughtless as you were back then,
I swear that you are Godless.

Hey, I guess you're lonely, when
I gave, you only took, So then
It's stranger then its ever been.
I guess it's what you wanted.

Of late, it seems that
lonely I will be.
I beg, I bleed,
but this is all that I've gotten.

Hey, as for today, my friend,
To hope that you could ever bend,
I swear you are, I swear you are,
I swear that you are Godless.

Hey, I said you're Godless then.
Hey, and you're a soulless friend,
Hey, I said you're Godless and
I swear, I swear

You're Godless
You're Godless
You're Godless
