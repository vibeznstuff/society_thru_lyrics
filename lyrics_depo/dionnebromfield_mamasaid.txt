Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this Mama said
(Mama said mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this my Mama said
(Mama said mama said)

I went walking the other day
Everything was going fine
I met a little boy named Billy Joe
And then I almost lost my mind


Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this Mama said
(Mama said mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this my Mama said

My eyes are wide open
But all that I can see is
Chapel bells are callin for everyone but-a me
But I don't worry cause


Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this Mama said
(Mama said mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this my Mama said

And then she said someone will look at me
Like I'm looking at you one day
Then I might find
I don't want it any old way
So I don't worry cause


Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this Mama said
(Mama said mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this my Mama said

Mama said mama said
Hey! Don't you worry
Mama said mama said
Hey! Don't you worry now.
Mama said mama said
Hey! Hey!
