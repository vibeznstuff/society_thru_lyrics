I don't mind you coming here
And wasting all my time
Cause when you're standing oh so near
I kinda lose my mind
It's not the perfume that you wear
It's not the ribbons in your hair
And I don't mind you coming here
And wasting all my time

I don't mind you hanging out
And talking in your sleep
It doesn't matter where you've been
As long as it was deep, Yeah
You always knew to wear it well
And, You look so fancy I can tell
And I don't mind you hanging out
And talking in your sleep

I guess you're just what I needed
(Just what I needed)
I needed someone to feed
I guess you're just what I needed
(Just what I needed)
I needed someone to bleed

I don't mind you coming here
And wasting all my time, time
Cause when you're standing oh so near
I kinda lose my mind, Yeah
It's not the perfume that you wear
It's not the ribbons in your hair
I don't mind you coming here
And wasting all my time

I guess you're just what I needed
(Just what I needed)
I needed someone to feed
I guess you're just what I needed
(Just what I needed)
I needed someone to bleed

I guess you're just what I needed
(Just what I needed)
I needed someone to feed
I guess you're just what I needed
(Just what I needed)
I needed someone to bleed
