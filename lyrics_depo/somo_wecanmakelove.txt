I can be tender, I can be rough
I can do anything you care for
Everything above
Baby, let me rock your body, ride your body
Kiss your favorite spot

Tie your hands behind your back
Feel my fingertips above your shoulders
You like it when I drive it, yeah, I push the clutch
I just want it all, but no rush

So we can make love
Or we can just fuck
We can get romantic, dirty dancing
Feel my hands until the sun comes up

We can make love
We can, we can just fuck
We can make love
We can, we can just fuck
We can make love
We can, we can just fuck
We can just fuck
We can, we can just fuck

You love when I'm sweet babe
I love when you bite
You love it when I cover up your eyes for a minute
But only some nights

I love when you ask me
To tickle your back
You love when I reach up underneath
And grab between your thighs like that

Baby, let me rock your body, ride your body
Kiss your favorite spot
You're screaming out my name, you don't have to tell me stop
The way your body is moving like a bubble 'bout to pop
I just want it all so don't stop

And we can make love
Or we can just fuck
We can get romantic, dirty dancing
Feel my hands until the sun comes up

We can make love
We can, we can just fuck
We can make love
We can, we can just fuck
We can make love
We can, we can just fuck
We can just fuck
We can, we can just fuck
Just ride it out

We can make love
We can, we can just fuck
We can make love
We can, we can just fuck
We can make love
We can, we can just fuck
We can just fuck
We can, we can just fuck

And we can make love
Or we can just fuck
We can get romantic, dirty dancing
Feel my hands until the sun comes up

Baby, let me rock your body, ride your body
Kiss your favorite spot
Tie your hands behind your back
Feel my fingertips above your shoulders
You like it when I drive it, yeah, I push the clutch
I just want it all, but no rush

We can make love
We can, we can just fuck
We can make love
We can, we can just fuck
We can make love
We can, we can just fuck
We can just fuck
We can, we can just fuck

Oh No 
No no

Just ride it out 

Ride it out, I swear
Take your clothes off and leave them right there
Tell me you love me even if you don't
I wanna make love tonight, I don't care yeah
Just ride it out {Just ride it out}
Just ride it out, ride it out
