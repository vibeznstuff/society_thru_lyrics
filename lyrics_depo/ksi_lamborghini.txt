Got rocks on my wrist, that shit you can't resist
Cash flow greater than the haters hating on my jizz
Riding in your face, looking like I found a damn genie
Riding in my Lamborghini

La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Bitch, I know you see me in my Lamborghini
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Ride so quick, you would think I'm Houdini

Been in the game since Namco
Bring it back, I'm fully gassed, yo
Vroom, vroom, in my brand new Lambo
Juiced up, and I don't give a damn, yo
Going 120, and that's my slowest
On a one-way lane, like Lois
Who's that? Superman's bitch
Wanna see what happens when I touch the Superman switch?
Ride with more peers than Morgan
Drive past bloggers that are walking
I taunt them, Matt Lees, can you see me?
Riding in my Lamborghini

La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Bitch, I know you see me in my Lamborghini
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Ride so quick, you would think I'm Houdini


I be at home on the Xbox
Lord of the Mics in the background, slewing MCs with dreadlocks
Snap that party, told this girl "come round"
Chick's long-tempered but her head top
She goes hard till my head drops
It's all eyes when we connect
Doggystyle and a Playboy bunny from downstairs, upstairs
Sound like a pet shop
Guys wanna hype on man
Call KSI, come yours and I'll put you in a headlock
I've been around since CoD 4
Search and Destroy hardcore G3 with a red dot
Haters get treated like a ho
You can tell them suck my dick and get lost
Paparazzi wanna take pics when I'm out with my son
You can all get headshots
This flow's like Formula One
Cause I use the track like DRS
Quickly boosting the PRS
She's going ape when I beat her chest
Bro, it's mad
You can tell Rihanna come see me
Might have to speed dial in that genie
JJ, lend me the Lamborghini

La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Bitch, I know you see me in my Lamborghini
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Ride so quick, you would think I'm Houdini

When my Lambo on the track, fall back
When I'm riding at speed, get that neck crack
Blazing on the engine, everybody looking back
Like I'm shooting, gratata, got them going, "fuck that"
Raise the fucking doors, I said make it look
Like a fucking eagle, like I'm starting wars
Dictating with my V12 deagle, speeds ain't even legal
Scaring people, we ain't equal
Danny Glover ain't got shit on my motherfucking lethal weapon
Armageddon sounding when the man arrives
When we hype I come alive, like a 5 Alive
On the drive 21 years, smashing up the scene
And I keep on winning, like I'm Mr Charlie Sheen

La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Bitch, I know you see me in my Lamborghini
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Ride so quick, you would think I'm Houdini
