I've loved and I've lost
I've added the cost up, now I want to live
Free to start all over and if you say you will
I've nothing to promise
And all that I want is to know we have this chance
We can make it different
If you just understand

That I'm in it for love
I'm not in it for the love of a stranger
There's no limit for us
Let the walls come tumblin' down

You've sheltered your dreams
And what does it mean
To you if you can't say
That you have someone to side with you
When you're going against the grain

I've been there before and one thing's for sure
It's time I need some help
This heart holds out for you
Waiting here for no one else

I'm in it for love
I'm not in it for the love of a stranger
Cause there ain't enough time
There ain't enough love to be found, in this world
If we're in it for love
There can be no hurt, harm or danger
There's no limit for us
Let the walls come tumblin' down

You and me
Leaving our heartache in the sand
The sky's wide open this time
This time it's love we're holding in our hands

I'm in it for love
I'm not in it for the love of a stranger
Cause there ain't enough time
There ain't enough love to be found, in this world
If we're in it for love
There can be no hurt, harm or danger
There's no limit for us
Let the walls come tumblin' down

I'm in it for love
Nothin' else but love
Just believe when I say
(I'll give you my heart)
I need your love, I need your heart
I've loved and I've lost
I've paid the cost for your love
We're holding love in our hands
I know that you'll understand
In it for love
I'm not in it for the love of a stranger
Let the walls come tumbling down
There can be no hurt, harm or danger
