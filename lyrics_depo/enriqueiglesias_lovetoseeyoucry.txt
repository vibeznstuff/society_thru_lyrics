(Come on. Let me tell you)

Maybe I just wanna touch you, feel your warm inside again
Maybe I just wanna hurt you, the sweetest pleasure is me

I don't know why, why but I love to see you cry
I don't know why, why it just makes me feel alive

Are you coming to the moment when you know your heart can break?
I'm inside you, I'm around you, just wanna hear you cry again

I don't know why, why but I love to see you cry
I don't know why, why it just makes me feel alive
I don't know why, why but I love to see you cry
I don't know why, why but it makes me feel alive

You don't know how much it hurts when you fall asleep in my arms
Live this night before the morning comes I wanna run away, I wanna run away

I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why

I don't know why, why but I love to see you cry
I don't know why, why it just makes me feel alive
I don't know why, why but I love to see you cry
I don't know why, why but it just makes me feel alive
