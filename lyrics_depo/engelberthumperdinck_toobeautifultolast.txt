Was it too beautiful to last. 
The love we share together, 
The dreams we dared together, 
Was it too beautiful to last. 
Walking hand in hand, 
The dawn discloses, 
We were dreaming of a land, 
Where love reposes, 
But castles made of sand, 
Like winter roses are fated to die, 
My darling like you and I, 
My darling. 
Where are those sweet Septembers, 
The joy my heart remembers? 
Lost in the shadows of the past. 
The rainbow arched above you, 
The sacred words I love you, 
Why did that dream go by so fast? 
Was it too beautiful,  
Was it too beautiful to last?
