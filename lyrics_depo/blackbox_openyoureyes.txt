Love is freewheeling, keeps me wakin' all night long 
But just like makin' love, becomes a part of you 
Nobody's losing when we get so satisfied 
Because of you i've got to shouting out my love 

Open your eyes, there's my love, turn it over 
Open your eyes, it's no time to be afraid 
Open your eyes, till the dawn's up and over 
Open your eyes, there's you bed and it's made 

Gimme that feeling and we'll rock it on out strong 
But when you're makin' just like i do to you 
The night is growing and i think we're gonna fly 
It's just for you that i'll be shouting out my love
