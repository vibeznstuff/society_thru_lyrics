I got you, I got you on my mind
And it's time to make you see (What I want)
So I'll just make this a little more obvious
'Cos I get what I want
And I want you to get with me

Don't think you know
How far I'm gonna go

You can't stop this feeling
You can't run away
Baby I'm what's on your mind
You can't stop this feeling
There's no escape
No sleep tonight
You won't get no sleep tonight

You want me,
You want me all the time
And you don't need nothing else
But you seem to be a little oblivious
So I'll show you the way
If you think that you need some help

Tell me baby
Are you coming with me

You can't stop this feeling
You can't run away
Baby I'm what's on your mind
You can't stop this feeling
There's no escape
No sleep tonight
You won't get no sleep tonight
No sleep tonight
No sleep tonight

Boy you won't be sleeping
No sleep tonight
Do I have to spell it out in black and white
Boy you won't be sleeping
No sleep tonight
Do I have to spell it out in black and white
No sleep tonight
No sleep tonight
No sleep tonight
