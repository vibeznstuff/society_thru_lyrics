Don't play this game with me
you know you came to be my world
when times were bad enough
seems I was good enough
you run out my door
you come back, and beg for more and more
just like the times before
you'll always be

Guaranteed a place inside my heart
I would never forget a single thing
always be a martyr to your heart
then you'll never regret a single thing

You think I just don't care (just don't care)
the fact is, I could not bear (could not bear)
to lose this kind of loving touch (I love your touch)
would you be bothered much?
you had so much planned (so much planned)
so take time to understand (understand)
my reasons for pulling you back to me (back to me)
you'll always be

Guaranteed a place inside my heart
I would never forget a single thing
always be a martyr to your heart
then you'll never regret a single thing

You hide so many years
(hide away)
you cried so many tears
(cried away your tears)
you think I just don't realise
(now I realise)
one thing I've come to know
(if you stay)
this pain will surely go
(all the way with me)
so soon before your very eyes

Guaranteed a place inside my heart
I would never forget a single thing
always be a martyr to your heart
then you'll never regret a single thing

Guaranteed a place inside my heart
I would never forget a single thing
always be a martyr to your heart
then you'll never regret a single thing

Guaranteed ...
