'Til now, I always got by on my own (Own)
I never really cared until I met you (Till I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone


I sit back and reminisce, it hurts to think about it all
We was on top of the world, whoever thought that we would fall
Standing by the phone, alone, ignoring your call
I feel like spiderman, you got me flying off of the wall
I ain't wanna leave, but still I had to go
'Cause what goods a rainbow without my pot of gold
But now your bed's empty and your pillow's cold
You never realized the love until my love was gone

When I said I could move on and go
You said I'm weak and it shows
I couldn't go on without you
Now I'm sitting in this house alone
Wondering why I left home
And I'm hoping that you know that

'Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone


You act like you don't need me
'Cause you're scared of being needy
You want to have your cake and eat it too
I call that being greedy
And they say that love costs
Consider this a freebie
No one said this would be easy
Either love me or just leave me
Admit it, we too old for pretendin'
Ain't like our bond is broken
It just needed some mending
And when you need a hand
You know I'll be there to lend it
What's the point in having time
If I ain't there to help you spend it
Yeah

When I said I could move on and go
You said I'm weak and it shows
I couldn't go on without you
Now I'm sitting in this house alone
Wondering why I left home
And I'm hoping that you know that

'Til now, I always got by on my own (Own)
I never really cared until I met you (Till I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone
How do I get you alone

I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh, I hope that it won't end though
Alone

And I'm hoping that you know that

'Til now, I always got by on my own (Own)
I never really cared until I met you (Till I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone

'Til now, I always got by on my own (Own)
I never really cared until I met you (Till I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone
How do I get you alone
