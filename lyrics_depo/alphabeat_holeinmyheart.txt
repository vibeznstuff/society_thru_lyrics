You've made a hole in my heart 

And they can say what they want,
but it doesn't mean a thing
and if they went inside me,
changed everything
this sure is nothing
that a dark look can't cure
its not a disease
no, that's for sure!

I was looking for a way to get close to you
but I got inside
I got inside
Nothing in the world could pull me back again
Now I'm inside
Now I'm inside


You
You turn me upside down
whenever you're around
you turn me upside dow-ow-own

You
You turn me upside down
whenever you're around
you turn me upside dow-ow-own

You've the hole in my heart 

And the gap that you have made goes deep inside of me
It's all used to invade, girl, you got my garantee
what this is you do to me, it's nothing done before
don't want you to stop, no, that's for sure

I was looking for a way to get close to you, but I got inside
I got inside
nothing in the world can pull me back again
Now I'm inside, Now I'm inside


You
You turn me upside down
whenever you're around
you turn me upside dow-ow-own

You
You turn me upside down
whenever you're around
you turn me upside dow-ow-own

All I want to do is to do something with you 


You
You turn me upside down
whenever you're around
you turn me upside dow-ow-own

You
You turn me upside down
whenever you're around
you turn me upside dow-ow-own
