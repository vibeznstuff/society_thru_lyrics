Is it so hard to remember
When we go back to September
We were, we were like
You’re a throwback to forever
In your denim jeans and leather
As you, yeah we were like
All these things that you like to leave behind
All these things that you like to leave behind

And if it matters at all
It matters at all
You’re waiting for your first time
You wait until there’s something wrong
Could you always be the one who says goodnight, goodnight, goodnight?

I’m watching, I’m choking

As you take a drawback on a cinder
Hanging limp between your fingers
We were, yeah we were like
As you passed out as a heart throb
When you woke up in a day job
We were, yeah we were like, we were like
All these things that you like to leave behind
All these things that you like to leave behind

And if it matters at all
It matters at all
You’re waiting for your first time
You wait until there’s something wrong
Could you always be the one who says goodnight, goodnight, goodnight?

And if it matters at all
If it matters at all
You’re waiting for your first time
You wait until there’s something wrong
Matters at all
It matters at all
You’re waiting for your first time
You wait until there’s something wrong
Could you always be the one who says goodnight, goodnight, goodnight?

Goodnight! (Goodnight)
