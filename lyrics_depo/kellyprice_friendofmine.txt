 - She was a friend of mine, she left with my man
She lied, cheated, took all I had
She was a friend of mine, she used what she knew
She lied, cheated, and left me confused

I feel so lost, don't know why this has happened to me
My closest friend, I never would have thought it could be
You were someone, someone I really thought I could trust
But my man, you laid, and I'm betrayed



Thicker than blood, wherever there was me where was you
My all was your all, but that wasn't enough for you
You had to see and tried to walk a mile in my shoes
In my head, in my bed
Betrayed by my best friend



 - Why? Why?
Why? Why?
MMMMMMMMM
Why? Why?
Why? Why?
