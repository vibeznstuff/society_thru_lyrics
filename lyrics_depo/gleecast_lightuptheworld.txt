Hey hey hey
You and me keep on dancing in the dark
It's been tearing me apart
Never knowing what we are

Hey hey hey
You and me keep on trying to play it cool
Now it's time to make a move
And that's what I'm gonna do

Lay it all down
Got something to say
Lay it all down
Throw your doubt away
Do or die now
Step on to the plate
Blow the door wide open like up up and away

Let's light up the world tonigh-igh-ight
You gotta give up the bark and bi-I-ite
I know that we got the love, alrigh-igh-ight
Come on and ligh-ligh-light it up
Light it up tonight

Let's light up the world tonigh-igh-ight
You gotta give up the bark and bi-I-ite
I know that we got the love, alrigh-igh-ight
Come on and ligh-ligh-light it up
Light it up tonight

Hey hey hey
You and me turn it up 10, 000 watts
Tell me why we gotta stop
I just wanna let it rock

Hey hey hey
You and me keep on staring at the road
Like we don't know where to go
Step back, let me take control

Lay it all down
Got something to say
Lay it all down
Throw your doubt away
Do or die now
Step on to the plate
Blow the door wide open like up up and away

Let's light up the world tonigh-igh-ight
You gotta give up the bark and bi-I-ite
I know that we got the love, alrigh-igh-ight
Come on and ligh-ligh-light it up
Light it up tonight

Let's light up the world tonigh-igh-ight
You gotta give up the bark and bi-I-ite
I know that we got the love, alrigh-igh-ight
Come on and ligh-ligh-light it up
Light it up tonight

Hey hey hey you
Hey hey hey you
Hey hey hey you
Hey hey hey you you you you you

Lay it all down
Got something to say
Lay it all down
Throw your doubt away
Do or die now
Step on to the plate
Blow the door wide open like up up and away

Let's light up the world tonigh-igh-ight
You gotta give up the bark and bi-I-ite
I know that we got the love, alrigh-igh-ight
Come on and ligh-ligh-light it up
