Where it began, I can't begin to knowing 
But then I know it's growing strong 
Was in the spring, 
And spring became the summer 
Who'd believe you'd come along 

Hands, touching hands, reaching out 
Touching me, touching you 
Oh, sweet Caroline 
Good times never seem so good 
I've been inclined to believe it never would 

Oh, sweet Caroline 
Good times never seem so good 
I've been inclined to believe it never would oooh oh no no..
