Ti amo
God how I love you so
My heart just won't let go
Day after day I'm still holdin' on
Even though you're gone

Ti amo
Wasn't I good to you?
I did all that I could do
To make you want to be here with me
I thought you loved me

I can't believe, you could just turn and leave
Did it so easily
You pulled my world out from under me
Look what you've done to me

How could you end it this way
After the love that we made?
God, how I wish you had stayed
Can't you see that I just want you back?

Ti amo
I never had a clue
That I was losin' you
You never once let me know
You were lettin' me go

Oh, I guess it was there in your eyes
Guess it was there in your sighs
Guess it was there in your lies
I was blind then, couldn't face the end

Ti amo
Thought we'd go on and on
Thought we had something strong
You pulled my world out from under me
Look what you've done to me

How could you end it this way
After the love that we made?
God, how I wish you had stayed
Can't you see that I just want you back?

Ti amo
God, how I love you so
My heart just won't let go
Day after day I'm still holdin' on
Even though you're gone

Guess it was there in your eyes
Guess it was there in your sighs
Guess it was there in your lies
I was blind then, couldn't face the end

Ti amo
Thought we'd go on and on
Thought we had something strong
You pulled my world out from under me
Look what you've done to me

How could you end it this way
After the love that we made?
God, how I wish you had stayed
Can't you see that I just want you back?

Ti amo
Wasn't I good to you?
Did all that I could do
To make you want to be here with me
I thought you loved me

I can't believe, you could just turn and leave
Did it so easily
You pulled my world out from under me
Look what you've done to me

Ti amo
God, how I love you so
My heart just won't let go
Day after day I'm still holdin' on
Even though you're gone
