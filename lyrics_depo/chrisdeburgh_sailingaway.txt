Waiting at the water's edge,
Watching all the ships as they are heading for the harbour wall,
I was just a boy, I was just a boy,
Dreaming of the wide world, dreaming of the wide world;

Watching as they disappear,
Reading out the names of all the places I have never been,
Looking out to sea, staring out to sea,
Dreaming of a wide world, dreaming of the wide world;

I wish I was sailing away, sailing away,
Sailing away, with you tonight, with you tonight;

Walking down another street,
Underneath the red lights, I am watching where the shadows fall,
Looking at the girls, listening to the girls,
Dreaming of a new world, dreaming of that new world;

I wish I was sailing away, sailing away,
Sailing away, in your arms tonight,
In your arms tonight;

I wish I was sailing away, sailing away,
Sailing away, with you now, with you now...
