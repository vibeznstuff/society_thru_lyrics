(Beat)
(H-H-Heartbeat)

Every time I see you something happens to me
Like a chain reaction between you and me
My heart starts missing a beat
My heart starts missing a beat
Every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time

If I didn't love you, I would look around for someone else
But every time I see you, you have the same effect
My heart starts missing a beat
My heart starts missing a beat
Every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Every time

I hear your heart beat next to me
I'm in love with you; I mean what I say
I'm in love with you, and you don't know
What it means to be with you

Every time I see you, no matter what we do
There's a strange reaction, can you feel it too?
My heart starts missing a beat
My heart starts missing a beat
Every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time

I hear your heart beat next to me
I'm in love with you; I mean what I say
I'm in love with you, and you don't know
What it means to be with you

Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time

(Beat) Every time
