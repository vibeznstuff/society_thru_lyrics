Some times you get a thing for me and you want my company, yes, you do, baby
So I drive for miles to be where you are
I know each time I go I give a little of me away, each time, baby
Just tell me am I the fool who came to town, am I, baby

Is it love you're after
Or just a good time, tell me, baby
Is it love, love, love you're after
Or just a good time

I don't need a thrill to make me feel what I already am, pretty woman, baby
I just want something real when it all goes down, yeah, yeah
Can I believe, put my trust in this love I have found, can I, honey
Or do I have to ride the merry-go-round, do I, baby

Is it love you're after
Or just a good time, tell me, baby
Is it love, love, love you're after
Or just a good time

I wanna know, I wanna know
I've got to know, I've got to know
I wanna know, I wanna know
I've got to know, I've got to know

I've got to know, I've got to know
I wanna know, I wanna know
I've got to know, I've got to know
I wanna know, I wanna know

'Cause, baby, I love you so, I love you so
I wanna know, I wanna know
I've got to know, I've got to know
I wanna know, I wanna know

Is it love you're after
Or just a good time, tell me, baby
Is it love, love, love you're after
Or just a good time

Do you see me for who I am
Do you find me easy
Do you love me more
To want to stay inside me
Guide me, oh... oh...

Is it love you're after
Or just a good time, tell me, baby
Is it love, love, love you're after
Or just a good time
