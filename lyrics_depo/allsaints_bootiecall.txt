Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now
Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now
Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now
Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now
Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now
Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now
Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now
Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now

Never stop giving good love
Cos that's why I call you for
(yo, whats up, baby?)
Never stop, baby, give it up
Cos I know where it came from - you got more

I like playing games
And if it's all the same,
You could bring it on with the rough stuff
And give me your love - I don't wanna be tamed

I need a man to be a real man
In order what I got in store,
Always finish what you start baby
And always having me beg for more,

You know I wanna be diggy down, boy
but I don't get around,
Jimmy has to ride in your pocket or lock him in your wallet,
It's just a bootie call

Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now (its a bootie call)
Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now (its just a bootie call)
Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now (its a bootie call)
Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now (its just a bootie call)

Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now 

I'm keen on what you is baby
Names are always good to have 
You never let me down 
I'm always happy when you make me laugh
But don't try to find

This heart of mine
Emotions, they'll come into my head, so don't be misled
My heart doesn't need to be bled
Aren't we trying to be smart baby?

Don't need the rollercoaster ride
I've been it, seen it and done it all yeah, yeah 
Don't want you messing with my mind

So don't be a fool
Keep this as your number one rule 

Good loving is not always from the heart
You gotta be smart
Ha ha
Stay just the way you are

It's just a bootie call (It's a bootie call)
It's just a bootie call (It's a bootie call)
It's just a bootie call

Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now (its a bootie call)
Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now (its just a bootie call)
Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now (its a bootie call)
Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now
It's just a bootie call

It's a bootie call, it's a bootie call
It's a bootie, it's a bootie call
It's a bootie call, it's a bootie call
It's a bootie, it's a bootie call

Please hang up and try you call again
Please hang up now
