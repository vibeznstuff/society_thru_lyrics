Put your lighters in the air
If you've ever felt scared
'Cause you've lost the one
Who was the one

Put your lighters in the sky
If you're sleeping alone tonight
'Cause you've lost the one

You were my best friend and boyfriend all at the same time
It's funny to think I've known you my whole life,
I can't even remember a time when we weren't together
Thinking back to the time where you promised it would last forever
We'd only just learned what love was
But I tried to impress you with my lip gloss

Now I'm sitting here wondering "Where does the love go?"
Only thing I have is a voice and a lighter, so,

Put your lighters in the air
If you've ever felt scared
'Cause you've lost the one
Who was the one

Put your lighters in the sky
If you're sleeping alone tonight
'Cause you've lost the one
Who was the one

The one, the one, the one, the one

You were so young, you couldn't even say it
And these were the park at the swings we're just playing,
Well, I remember everything that you wrote,
"Will you go out with me?" on a post-it note.
I wrote, "Yes," then I gave it back
You said I could keep it and I still got that,

Now I'm sitting here wondering "Where does the love go?"
Only thing I have is a voice and a lighter, so,

Put your lighters in the air
If you've ever felt scared
'Cause you've lost the one
Who was the one

Put your lighters in the sky
If you're sleeping alone tonight
'Cause you've lost the one
Who was the one

The one, the one, the one, the one

Back then it was so different,
I didn't even have to ask and you'd listen,
We've been a couple since forever,
It's so weird that we ain't together,
And every time I see you I wanna cry,
And every time you look at me I die inside,

Now I'm sitting here wondering "Where does the love go?"
Everyone grab your lighters if they left you alone.

So, put your lighters in the air,
If you've ever felt scared,
'Cause you've lost the one,
Who was the one

Put your lighters in the sky,
If you're sleeping alone tonight
'Cause you've lost the one
Who was the one

The one, the one
The one, the one
The one
