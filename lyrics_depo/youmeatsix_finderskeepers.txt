You've got a nerve, giving me the cold shoulder,
Giving me the twice over when it's not deserved.
And we'll talk again when you're sober,
You'll say that I've got cold and our heat is gone.

I want to be your eyes so that you can see what you've done.
I want to be your ears so that you can hear everything that's been missing

Finders keepers will you keep me in mind
I like secrets cause they keep me in line
Old habits die hard, but I am too young to die.

I guess that a mess is what you make of it, so why are we still laying in it?
I can barely sleep, barely eat,
And it's been three whole weeks since I heard you speak.

Oh it's so hard to take
That eighteen months was built to break.
Oh I love mistakes especially ones you've made.
I bet you're sorry.

Finders keepers will you keep me in mind
I like secrets cause they keep me in line
Old habits die hard, but I am too young to die.

Finders keepers the whole thing is a lie
You won't find her cause she's too hard to find
Take my advice and boy run a mile.

And have another drink and then think this one over
You dig yourself a grave everyday you're not sober
Do you see what I mean
I have your best interests written all over me.
I could never be what you need

Finders keepers will you keep me in mind
I like secrets cause they keep me in line
Old habits die hard, but I am too young to die.

Finders keepers the whole thing is a lie
You won't find her cause she's too hard to find
Take my advice and boy run a mile.

And I bet you guess me right
(you guess me, yes, you guessed me right)
I bet you guess me right.
