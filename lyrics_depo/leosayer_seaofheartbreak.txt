Oh the lights in the harbour
They don't shine for me
I'm like a lost ship
Adrift on the sea
Sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine
How I wish
You were mine again my dear
I'm on the sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak
Oh, how did I lose you
Oh where did I fail
Why did you leave me
Always to sail
Sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine
How I wish
You were mine again my dear
I'm on the sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak
Oh what I'd give to sail back to shore
Back to your arms once more



Come to my rescue, oh come here to me
Take me and keep me away from the
Sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine
How I wish you were mine again my dear
I'm on a sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak
