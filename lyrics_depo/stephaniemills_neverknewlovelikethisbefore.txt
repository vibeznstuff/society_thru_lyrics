I never knew love like this before;
Now I'm lonely never more,
Since you came into my life...

You are my lovelight, this I know,
And I'll never let you go;
You're my all, you're part of me...

Once I was lost, and now I'm found,
Then you turned my world around;
When I need, I call your name...

'Cause I never knew love like this before;
Opened my eyes,
'Cause I never knew love like this before;
What a surprise,
'Cause I never knew love like this before...

This feeling's so deep inside of me,
Such a tender fantasy;
You're the one I'm living for...

You are my sunlight and my rain,
And time could never change
What we share forevermore...

Ooh, hoo... I never knew love like this before;
Now I'm lonely never more,
Since you came into my life...

'Cause I never knew love like this before;
Opened my eyes,
'Cause I never knew love like this before;
What a surprise,
'Cause I never knew love like this before...

You are my lovelight, this I know,
And I'll never let you go;
You're my all, you're part of me...

Once I was lost, and now I'm found,
Then you turned my world around;
When I need, I call your name...

'Cause I never knew love like this before;
Opened my eyes,
'Cause I never knew love like this before;
What a surprise,
'Cause I never knew love like this before...
Inside of me,
(I never) never knew love like this before...
Opened my eyes...
