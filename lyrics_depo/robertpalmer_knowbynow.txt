You ought to know by now

Baby when our hearts awoke
Think of all the rules we broke
In the name of love we hoped
Little did we know
Darling all the time we spent
Ignoring all the consequences
And hiding from big evidence
Hoping things would change

But the yearning grew like the loneliness of a castaway
To be near to you was the only thing in my heart each day
Keeping me alive till your rescue came
Honey you mean everything to me

You ought to know by now
Love means everything
You ought to know by now
Only love can bring happiness

Wishful thinking spent in vain
What to loose and what to gain
All the guilt and all the pain
Seemed to come away
And baby when our hearts awoke
Think of all the rules we broke
In the name of love we spoke
Little did we know

But the hope was there like a ray of sun on a cloudy day
Any change from impossibility to the only way
Love can conquer all and it's here to stay
Honey you mean everything to me

You ought to know by now
Love means everything
You ought to know by now
Only love can bring happiness
You ought to know by now
Love means everything
You ought to know by now
Only love can bring happiness
You ought to know by now

You ought to know by now

You ought to know by now

You ought to know by now
