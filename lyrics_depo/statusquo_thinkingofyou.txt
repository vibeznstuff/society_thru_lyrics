Up in the morning and down in the evening
Light in the night time and dark in the day
Running for something and waiting for nothing
Looking at people and hiding away
Asking a question when I know the answer
Hanging around when I just wanna play

I'm thinking of you again
I'm thinking of you
Don't know what to do again
But I'm thinking of you
Tell me what you're doing then
I'll know that it's you
Don't wanna be blue again
So I'm thinking of you

Into a new day and out on the highway
Cut in the fast lane and going so slow
Talking 'bout old days and walking in new ways
Watching those tv reality shows
Sitting in silence with standing room only
Moving in closer and ready to go

I'm thinking of you again
I'm thinking of you
Don't know what to do again
But I'm thinking of you
Tell me what you're doing then
I'm thinking of you

Where are we going
We're on a roll
You'll see me coming
I'm coming through

Up in the morning and down in the evening
Light in the night time and dark in the day
Asking a question when I know the answer
Hanging around when I just wanna play

I'm thinking of you again
I'm thinking of you
Don't know what to do again
But I'm thinking of you
Tell me what you're doing then
I'll know that it's you again
Don't wanna be blue again
So I'm thinking of you
