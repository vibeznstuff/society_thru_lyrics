I don't wanna feel the way that I do
I just wanna be right here with you
I don't wanna see, see us apart
I just wanna tell you straight from my heart

Hey, I can't sleep
I just can't breathe
When your shadow is all over me
Don't wanna be
A fool in your eyes
When all we had was built on lies

I don't wanna feel the way that I do
I just wanna be right here with you
I don't wanna see, see us apart
I just wanna tell you straight from my heart

I don't wanna feel the way that I do
I just wanna be right here with you
I don't wanna see, see us apart
I just wanna tell you straight from my heart
I miss you

What would it take
For you to see
To make you understand
That I always believe
You and I can make it through
You still know I can't get over you

I don't wanna feel the way that I do
I just wanna be right here with you
I don't wanna see, see us apart
I just wanna tell you straight from my heart

I don't wanna feel the way that I do
I just wanna be right here with you
I don't wanna see, see us apart
I just wanna tell you straight from my heart

I don't wanna feel the way that I do
I just wanna be right here with you
I don't wanna see, see us apart
I just wanna tell you straight from my heart

'Cause when our love fades away
Listen to me, hear what I say

I don't wanna feel the way that I do
I just wanna be right here with you
I don't wanna see, see us apart
I just wanna tell you straight from my heart

I don't wanna feel the way that I do
I just wanna be right here with you
I don't wanna see, see us apart
I just wanna tell you straight from my heart

I miss you

I don't wanna feel...
I don't wanna feel the way that I do
