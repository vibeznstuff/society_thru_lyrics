You say it would be better
If we stopped seeing each other
If you had only met me first
When you were free

'Cause now you've got commitment
I should not expect things from you
That you can't give to me
Oh, but baby can't you see?

I can't say goodbye to you
No matter how I try
You're such a part of me
Without you I would die

Deep in the heart of me
I know that you and I
Were meant to be forever
I can't tell you goodbye

Neither of us planned
That we would fall in love this way
But since we did
Why should we be apart?

Sometimes, some things happen
That can never be explained
Now, it's too late for me
I've already given you my heart

I can't say goodbye to you
No matter how I try
You're such a part of me
Without you I would die

Deep in the heart of me
I know that you and I
Were meant to be forever
I can't tell you goodbye

Who knows why we choose
When we choose the ones we love
Who knows why we do the things
We do when we're in love

I know that you're a decent man
And you try to do what's best
But how can I forget
All the feelings we have shared

I can't say goodbye to you
No matter how I try
You're such a part of me
Without you I would die

Deep in the heart of me
I know that you and I
Were meant to be forever
I can't tell you goodbye
(You and I were meant to be forever)
I can't tell you goodbye
