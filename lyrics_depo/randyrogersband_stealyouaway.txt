I can see you standing with him
He ain't holding your hand like he should
He ain't listening to a word you say 
He doesn't look at you the way I would
I should steal you away

Ive been wondering are you looking at me
Thinking how it might be if you were mine

Girl it drives me crazy 
He don't know what hes got 
I'm fighting so hard not to cross the line

I should steal you away I should steal you away

In the middle of the night come take your heart 
I should steal you away

I could see us walking out that door 
Not looking back as we roll down the road
And I would show you what a mans supposed to be
Take you anywhere you ever wanna go

I should steal you away I should steal you away
In the middle of the night come take your heart 
I should steal you away I should steal you away
