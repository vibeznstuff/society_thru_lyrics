Under a blanket of fear
Down a bottomless pit
I've been waiting for this night to open my eyes

Wide awake i see in the dark
See the fences breaking apart
Get together with my old friends

Once again we breathe in the air
Escape to somewhere far from nowhere

Where the sky's been tainted red
Where the sky's been tainted..

Up on a bank by a stream trading memories for dreams
Fading echoes and pictures we burn at the seams

And now our wings are painted gold
They'll make idols of us yet
Empty promises they sold
Will reach their best before dates soon...

I can see it all
