You made the mistake of letting me and my mates
In your house, you don't know us at all
And I can't be held responsible
For getting naked in your swimming pool
What a night, you're alright
And you're quite a sight for my sore eyes
Thing is you don't even realize
Your house is a joke, I'm that kind of bloke
A pipe and some slippers fit nicely

I think your parents might like me
Fuck this, I'm off to the party

We drink, we party, make love, make money
We've been grafting hard all week so until I'm an antique
We gonna drink and party, make love, make money
Doing things I'll forget but I'll never regret

Oh what a night da da da da da da
Oh what a night da da da da da da
Oh what a night da da da da da da
Oh what a night da da da da da da

She seems so pleasant but now she's screwing
Pacing 'round the house asking "what are you doing?"
Bottles everywhere and the carpet's ruined
Bedroom's fully booked, ripped sheets are brewing
Kitchen smells super bad like mc'lovin
What sick pup puts poo in the oven?
Alright darling, no need to shout
We've outstayed our welcome, I'll let myself out

I think your parents might hate me
It's a good job that I know karate

We drink, we party, make love, make money
We've been grafting hard all week so until I'm an antique
We gonna drink and party, make love, make money
Doing things I'll forget but I'll never regret

Oh what a night da da da da da da
Oh what a night da da da da da da
Oh what a night da da da da da da
Oh what a night da da da da da da
Oh what a night

They think that I should just sit down
I'm just getting started
I see the room is spinning 'round
I'm so partied
I don't get drunk, I get awesome
La la la la
I don't know what he's saying
Beer pong, Pokemon, everybody sing along

We drink, we party, make love, make money
We've been grafting hard all week so until I'm an antique
We gonna drink and party, make love, make money
Doing things I'll forget but I'll never regret

Oh what a night da da da da da da
Oh what a night da da da da da da
Oh what a night da da da da da da
Oh what a night da da da da da da
Oh what a night da da da da da da
Oh what a night da da da da da da
Oh what a night da da da da da da
Oh what a night da da da da da da
Oh what a night
