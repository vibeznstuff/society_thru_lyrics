You had to kill the conversation
You always had the upper hand
Got caught in love and stepped in sinking sand
You had to go and ruin all our plans
Packed your bags and you're leaving home
Got a one-way ticket and you're all set to go
But we have one more day together, so

Love me like there's no tomorrow
Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow

I guess we drift alone in separate ways
I don't have all that far to go
God knows I've learnt to play the lonely man
I've never felt so low in all my life
We were born to be just losers
So I guess there's a limit on how far we go
But we only have one more day together, so

Love me like there's no tomorrow
Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow

Tomorrow, God knows just where I'll be
Tomorrow, who knows just what's in store for me
Anything can happen, but we only have one more day together, yeah
Just one more day forever, so

Love me like there's no tomorrow
Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow

So, Love me like there's no tomorrow
Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow
