Oh look there you go again
Puttin' on that smile again
Even though I know you've had a bad day
Doin' this and doin' that
Always puttin' yourself last
A whole lotta give and not enough take
But you can only be strong so long before you break
So..


Fall
Go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine
I'll catch you every time you
Fall
Go on and lose it all
Every doubt every fear
Every worry every tear
I'm right here
Baby fall

Forget about the world tonight
All that's wrong and all that's right
Lay your head on my shoulder let it fade away
And if you wanna let go
Baby,  it's okay



Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
To me
