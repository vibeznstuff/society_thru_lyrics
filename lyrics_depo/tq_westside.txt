This is going out to the whole wide Westside
you know what i'm saying,
yeah break it down for me
steady mob, rock, rock on

I was just a young boy, livin in the hub city-Eastside Compton G
Back in the days when Ice Cube and Eazy had every Nigga
Talking 'bout boy you can't fuck with me
Remember Ice T had da power, hearing gunshots lickin' by the hour
When Too Short bumped in every supersport
And taught us all how to ride for the West Coast 


To my peoples if you with me - where you at 
Throw your dubs in the air - and wave 'em like you just don't care 
From LA to the Bay - what you say - all day... everyday... any damn day 
Take a look around, we got the whole world locked down 
Going on and on, it don't stop...won't stop... can't stop 
Either ride or die - that's why i put it down for the westside 

Didn't seem that long ago, (oh no) we were stealing 40's out the liquor store (oh no)
Mama started tripping so it's time to go 
Up to the park with the locsta's 
Everybody broke, smokin' roaches 
DJ Quik was the shit had every nigga claiming he was from the CPT 
Ya'll remember one-time tried to clown 
We had to burn this bitch on down 


One time for my niggas in incarceration 
I blaze a dime with you for having lots of patience 
Two times for my sista's at the county building 
I got some Westside love for all you ghetto children 
Three times for my niggas that done passed away 
I tip some gin for you and pray for better days 
One day everything's gonna be fine 
But until that day my only reply is... 
WESTSDIE TILL I DIE

Going on and on, it don't stop...won't stop... can't stop 
Either ride or die - gotta give it up for the Westside 

From Crenshaw to Foothill Blvd. 
All i see are Lo Lo's and mob cars - Daytons and five stars 
All the true hobs is hittin' switches 
With all the finest riches of course the bombest bitches 
Don't get it twisted Ask me what's a real G 
Show me a nigga scrapping back against the wall until his knuckles bleed 
Screaming death to all our enemies and those who don't believe 
WEST COAST LIVIN' BE THE SHIT TO ME!!!
