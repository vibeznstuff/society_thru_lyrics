I've walked through the valleys of the wilderness in time,
Only to find out that you have love in places I can't describe,
I need you, it's the sunrise

I just wanted to let you know,
I love you, don't ever let go,
'Cause the sun don't shine
When you're not around mine,
Singing I can never be without you,
Without you


Singing the sun don't shine,
The sun don't shine,
Yeah, the sun don't shine,
The sun don't shine
Without you, without you
Through all the space and time,
Your love is mine,
But the sun don't shine,
The sun don't shine
Without you, without you

When I saw you rise the other day,
I felt my worries just seemed to melt away,
Into you, yeah, into you

I just wanted to let you know,
I love you, don't ever let go,
'Cause the sun don't shine
When you're not around mine,
Singing I can never be without you,
Without you


Singing the sun don't shine,
The sun don't shine,
Yeah, the sun don't shine,
The sun don't shine
Without you, without you
Through all the space and time,
Your love is mine,
But the sun don't shine,
The sun don't shine
Without you, without you

I just wanted to let you know,
I love you, don't ever let go,
'Cause the sun don't shine
When you're not around mine,
Singing I can never be without you,
