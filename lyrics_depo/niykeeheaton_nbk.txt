Okay, check, 1, 3, baby count me in
I got 20 pretty bitches tryna be my friend
Now I got a boo callin' up sayin', "Wanna come chill at the crib?"
I mean if you bring a friend for LP, but you ain't sleepin' here
Pull your bitches on the Snapchat
Oh that was your girl? Hashtag
I ain't gotta do a thing
I'm just sittin' here and the beat in the back, back
Yeah that's right, relax that
Shit, I don't even drink, pass that
Now you're focused on me
And I ain't gotta do a goddamn thing, magic

I'm in my prime
NBK, on that 9 to 5
I'm in my prime
Naturyl Born Killers, put that on my life
Put that on my life
Put that on my life
Put that on my life
Put that on my life
