I've been waiting for the stars to come out 
Dinner it was fine, 
But I can't lie 'cause I've been waiting for ya 
To come back to mine 
I've been, thinking of you 24/7, and 365 
Now the girl from Impanema 
She's here right by my side 
I got you now and I just wanna 
Show you how to play 
Goosebumps on your body 
Guide the way 
I wanna go all night 
Ain't no stoppin' 'till the breakin' of the dawn 
I wanna go inside every corner 
Girl you really turn me on 
I wanna go knock knock 
Our bodies to the beat 
And when the morning comes 
we're letting the sun shine 
We'll stay in bed 
You can't separate us 
We fit together 

I can feel you comin' closer 
Dancin' in the dark (Dancin' in the dark) 
I touch your lips and kiss your shoulders 
Send a letter to your heart 
I can't explain to which extreme I'm feelin' you (Feelin' you) 
How many triple x dreams that's been starring you 
I got you now and I just wanna 
Show you how to play 
Goosebumps on your body 
Guide the way 

I wanna go all night 
Ain't no stoppin' 'till the breakin' of the dawn (Breakin' of the dawn) 
I wanna go inside every corner 
Girl you really turn me on (I wanna go I wanna go) 
I wanna go knock knock 
Our bodies to the beat 
And when the morning comes (When the morning comes) 
We're letting the sun shine 
We'll stay in bed (Oh baby) 
You can't separate us 
We fit together 

I won't get nothing done of what I oughta do, 
It doesn't really matter to me 
I-I-I-I am here with you 
I can't explain to what degree I'm feelin' you 
How many triple x dreams I've had starring you 
But I got you now and i just wanna show you how to play 
(Show you how to play) 
Goosebumps on your body 
Guide the way 

I wanna go all night, 
Ain't no stoppin' 'till the breakin' of the dawn (Breakin' of the dawn) 
I wanna go inside every corner (Every corner baby)

Our bodies to the beat (Knock knock to the beat) 
And when the morning comes 
We're letting the sun shine
