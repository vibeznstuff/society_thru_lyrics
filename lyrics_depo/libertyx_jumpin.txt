Wait until the clock hits midnight
Minute past I'm out the door
Pick me up before you drop by... oh...yeah

Made up from my head to my toes
Now we're moving to the floor,
Where the music takes me who knows...ooh yeah

This time I'm gonna get it right,
We're gonna dance til the morning light
All the boys and girls are out tonight
Come on everybody say... uh... ohh 


Everybody's coming all the party's jumpin and
We're gonna go crazy, baby
Now you've heard it let me see you work it
Everybody say...uh...oh (baby yeah)
Everybody's coming all the party's jumpin and
I'll be movin my body (body)
Now you've heard it let me see you work it
Everybody say...uh...oh (baby yeah)

You know we won't be home til daylight
Playing all my favorite songs
Everybody's loooking so fine...oh...yeah

Grab a guy and don't let him go
Gonna let him move real close
Where the mood will take me, who knows baby

This time I'm gonna get it right,
We're gonna dance til the morning light
All the boys and girls are out tonight
Come on everybody say... uh... ohh
