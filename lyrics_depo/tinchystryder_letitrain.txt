Black clouds are looking darker 
We bring the night to life 
I hope you got your lighter 
Spark the match and light 
Somehow we all survived 
Although they dimmed the lights 
They try to knock my future down 
The trees they tried to hide 

They say I'm an optimist 
Now look I topped the list 
Approved but not to this 
From negative to positive 
Yeah, dont fight the planes 
No parachutes, we let it rain 
From the inn I brought my troops 


Forecast to be grey again 
Feels as if it never ends 
Hide behind the door 
Anymore 
Let it rain 
Let it rain 
(you see the) 
Drip drop coming 
Everybody give way 
Cant stop forming 
May as well embrace 
Let it rain 
Let it rain 
Let it rain 
(you see the) 
Drip drop coming 
Everybody give way 


Said id walk the last for long 
Said I had one hit and wondered back my parted songs 
Asking whats the label on 
Had this came along 
Why the hell designer writes 
Told my ANR he's okay but now the game is wrong 

Now picture this 
Now I've got his day miss 
I've planned it all 
To rule the black the mist 
And now it's hours 
Lite and waiting for hours 
Full of basment to the rooftops 
We just played the hours 


Forecast to be grey again 
Feels as if it never ends 
Hide behind the door 
Anymore 
Let it rain 
Let it rain 
(you see the) 
Drip drop coming 
Everybody give way 
Cant cant forming 
May as well embrace 
Let it rain 
Let it rain 
Let it rain 
(you see the) 
Drip drop coming 
Everybody give way 
Cant cant forming 
May as well embrace 


I'm stepping out tonight 
There's a life would moan 
(I hear it calling) 
I'm afraid no more 
(can't stop me falling) 
Behind the grey there's light 
(black clouds) 
I'mma reach it by 
(standing across) 
At the end and I know 
I'm gonna to be alright 

You can keep it moving on 
No time on dwelling on 
They hum we sing along 
We're gonna be alright 
I know you see 
Infact they all believe 
Them cloud aboven me 
I let it rain 
Let it rain 
You see the 
Drip drop coming 
Everybody give way 
Cant cant forming 
May as well embrace 
Let it rain 
You see the 
Drip drop coming
