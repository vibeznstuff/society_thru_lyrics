Love, I have wounds,
Only you can mend,
You can mend.
I guess that's love,
I can't pretend,
I can't pretend.

Feel, my skin is rough,
But it can be cleansed,
It can be cleansed.
And my arms are tough,
But they can be bent,
They can be bent.

And I wanna fight,
But I can't contend.
I guess that's love,
I can't pretend,
I can't pretend.

Oh, feel our bodies grow,
And our souls they blend.
Yeah love I hope you know,
How much my heart depends.

But I guess that's love
I can't pretend,
I can't pretend.
I guess that's love
I can't pretend,
I can't pretend.

Oh feel our bodies grow,
And our souls they blend.
Yeah love I hope you know,
How much my heart depends.

I guess that's love
I can't pretend,
I can't pretend.
I guess that's love
I can't pretend,
I can't pretend.
