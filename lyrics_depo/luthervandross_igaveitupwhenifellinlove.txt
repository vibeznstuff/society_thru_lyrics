My friends told me all about it
They said I had to see for myself
But I never really cared much about love
I thought I could live without it
Until I met this one girl
And she was so fine
I knew she was the one who could change my mind


See, I used to be such a bad bad boy
And good times were my toy for joy
That was all I was thinking of
But I gave it up when I fell in love
I used to know the party people around the world
I gave it up when I found that girl
And she's the one treats me good enough
So I gave it up when I fell in love

I thought I was justified
To only see the world through my eyes
And that it was a waste of time talkin' 'bout love
But it only took a little time to make change my mind
'Cause when she said goodbye
See, I really thought I'd never stop crying




Now, every night I dream about you and our new love
All of my friends say I'm such a different guy
And they wonder
Oh, how they wonder

Ad lib
I gave it up
Sho' nuff gave it up
That was all I was thinking of
But I gave it up when I fell in love
