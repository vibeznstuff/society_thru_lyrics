Hey man what's the deal?
Everything you touch you kill
All this hope in the world won't wash away
All the blood that's on your hands is here to stay

Hey man what's the news
There's no talk, it's you
When you think it's God's words that you preach
From a book someone wrote that you read

Hey man
What are you up to there, what's your game?
What's going on, something's wrong
Hey man, what are you up to?
You keep on killing in God's name
Hey man
You're the only one to pray
There's blood on your hands, something's wrong
Hey man, what are you up to?
Have you even got a plan?
Or have you just lost your way?
Men are too afraid to say
Everything you killed was in the name of man
(Everything you killed)

Hey man whats on your mind?
Now that all your crimes have been erased by time
And all they have, you say you want, is what you stole
And all those people that you buried are bones

Hey man
What are you up to there, what's your game?
What's going on something's wrong
Hey man, what are you up to?
You keep on killing in the name of God
Hey man
You're the only one to pray
There's blood on your hands far too long
Hey man, what are you up to?
Have you even got a plan?
Or have you just lost your way?
Men are too afraid to say
Everything you killed was in the name of man

What's the word, when all the wars that you start you never win
Everything you love, you hurt
Yes, all that you make fall apart don't change a thing

Hey man, what's going on something's wrong
Hey man, what are you up to?
You keep on killing in the name of God
Hey man
You're the only one to pray
There's been blood on your hands, far too long
Hey man, how can we trust you?

Everything you killed was in the
Everything you killed was in the
Everything you killed was in the
Everything you killed was in the
Everything you killed was in the
Everything you killed was in the
Everything you killed was in the
Everything you killed was in the
Everything you killed was in the
Everything you killed was in the
Everything you killed was in the
Everything you killed was in the
Everything you killed was in the
Everything you killed was in the

When the leaves from the trees that were replaced
All the anger you breathe, gone to waste
When the world becomes a place with nothing wrong
All the land that you killed for, gone as well
