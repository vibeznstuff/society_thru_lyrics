If I played in a rock n roll band
And I didn't disappoint you again
Would you take back this
Low down ramblin' man

Cos we were so young and proud
The first time that I let you down
The look upon your face is
All that I see now

And I could list a thousand things
That's make me take you back again
But I don't really need you half as much
As I did then

Cos we were so young and proud
The first time that you let me down
The look upon your face is
All that I see now

I waited out on your street
Between Maple and 83
It wasn't really anything but
Bittersweet

Waited there all night long
Digging my nails into my palms
Waited for a light to come on
Waited for your light to guide me home

I am a big boy now
Don't have to be hangin around
I probably would have let you down again
Anyhow

And I am a big girl now
And I don't want you hanging around
You probably would have let me down again
Anyhow

You probably gonna let me down again
Anyhow
