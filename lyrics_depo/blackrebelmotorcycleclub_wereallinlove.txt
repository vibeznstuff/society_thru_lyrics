I'll keep it in my head till I know I
Until I know that I can leave your doorstep
Until I know the conversations cold
I'll hide it in the words until I know I
Until I know that I can be alone here
Until I know the consequences known

We're all in love with something that we can't see
We're all in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with something that I can't see
I'm in love with someone that I can't see

I'll throw you out and bring you back later
Everything I see's a complication
Everyone I known has come and go
I've fallen in the reason for the passion
Everyone needs something for their hands when
When they know they're gonna be alone

We're all in love with something that we can't see
We're all in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with something that I can't see
I'm in love with someone that I can't see

I'm looking for something to shout
Something I know I cannot doubt
I'm looking for something to shout
Something I know I cannot doubt
Come on won't help me out

We're all in love with something that we can't see
We're all in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with something that I can't see
I'm in love with someone that I can't see

I'm in love without you
I'm in love without you 
I'm in love without you 
I'm in love without you

We're all in love with something that we can't see
We're all in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with something that I can't see
I'm in love with someone that I can't see
