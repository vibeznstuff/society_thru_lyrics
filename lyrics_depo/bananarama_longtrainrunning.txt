Down around the corner 
Half a mile from here 
See them long trains run 
And you watch them disappear 

Without love, where would you be now 
Without love 

You know I saw miss Lucy 
Down along the tracks 
She lost her home and her family 
And she won't be coming back 

Without love, where would you be right now 
Without love 

Well the lilino is central 
On the southern central freight 
Gotta keep on pushing mama 
You know they're running late 

Without love, where would you be now 
Without love 

Well the pistons keep on turning 
And the wheels go round and round 
And the steel rails are cold and hard 
For the miles that they go down 

Without love, where would you be now 
Without love 

Baby baby baby baby babe 
Oh won't you move it down 
I gotta keep on moving 
Gotta keep on moving
