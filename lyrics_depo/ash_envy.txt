One, two, tree, four
Here's a taste of the seven sins

Driven to distraction, waiting on your call
I am getting trigger happy but it doesn't help at all
No, and I can't even think with you still in my head
No, and I cannot do anything, I want you in my head

Envy, envy, envy
Envy, envy, envy

Breathless, weak I'm distracted
I wanna get under your skin
Like a fever, you leave my mouth dry
But I can't do anything, can't stop this burning from within

C'mon, baby
(C'mon, baby, I want you)
Aww, c'mon, baby
(I want you)
C'mon, baby
(I want you)
C'mon
(C'mon, baby)

Yeah, fingertips in the honey dipped
You know it set my soul on fire
From her sultry hips to her velvet lips
You know I couldn't get much higher

I lose my  concentration
I walk around in a dream
So come on give me some of your reaction
I wanna know explicitly how it feels, so dirty sweet

C'mon, envy, envy, envy
Envy, envy, envy

C'mon baby
(C'mon baby, I want you)
Uhh, c'mon baby
(I want you)
C'mon baby
(I want you)
C'mon
Aww, too much, too much

Got struck by a lightening bolt
Between the eyes, got paralysed
Way before I realised, hypnotised
Conspiracy, mystery, the air she breathes
Controversy, I'm heading for the deep freeze

Envy, envy, envy
Envy, envy, envy

From the east to the west, the north to the south
I want you so bad, wanna turn you inside out
I wanna all night long, feel the sweet sensations
And sassy temptations of her hot vibrations
