My tendency
for dependency
Is offending me
It's upending me
I'm pretending see
To be strong and free
From my dependency
It's warping me

So much love
So rare to dare
Afraid of
Ever being there
Take me home
I need repair
Take me please
To anywhere


Descend
all the way
all the way
Everyday
Warped
and scared
Of
being
there

Descended from
Demented men
Struggle with
The art of Zen
Please don't look
Too close at me
You might not like
What you see



Night craving
Sends me crawling oh
Beg for mercy
Does it show
A vacancy
That's full of holes
Hold me please
I'm feeling cold
