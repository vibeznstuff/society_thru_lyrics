Call me crazy
In a world where no one, no one understands
It's good to finally find someone, someone who can
You know me
Better than I know myself
Don't care what they say
Don't care what this world thinks
We got each other
That's all we need
And you show me
I don't need nothing else

Call me crazy
Call me a fool (ooh)
Call me crazy, maybe it's true
But I'm crazy 'bout you (crazy)
I'm crazy 'bout you (I'm crazy)
I can't help it (help it)
Nothing I can do
I'm crazy, crazy 'bout you (crazy crazy crazy crazy)
And I love it cause I know you're crazy 'bout me too

When I lose my mind, when I'm a total mess
I smile cause you still think I'm the best
And I love you even when you're a wreck

Call me crazy
Call me a fool (hey)
Call me crazy, baby it's true
But I'm crazy 'bout you (I'm crazy)
I'm crazy 'bout you (I'm crazy)
You're my silver lining (you make the light)
You make the light come through
I'm crazy, crazy 'bout you (crazy 'bout you, crazy 'bout you)
And I love it cause I know you're crazy 'bout me too

And when this world tries to tear us down
They never will
They'll never break us apart
We're staying crazy at heart

Call me crazy
Crazy 'bout you (I'm crazy)
I'm crazy 'bout you (I'm crazy)
I can't help it, help it
Nothing I can do (nothing I can do)
I'm crazy, crazy 'bout you
And I love it cause I know
But I'm crazy 'bout you
I'm crazy, I'm crazy 'bout you (I'm crazy crazy crazy 'bout you baby, crazy crazy crazy 'bout you baby)
You're my silver lining
You make the light come through
I'm crazy, crazy 'bout you
(Call me crazy)
And I love it cause I know you're crazy 'bout me too
