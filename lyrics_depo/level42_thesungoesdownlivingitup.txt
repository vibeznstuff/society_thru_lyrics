Though I live in the edge time is on my side
All the doors to my life are open wide
Just as long as the wheels keep on turning round
I will live for the groove 'til the sun goes down

Living it up ... living it up ... I can feel it
Living it up ... is it a crazy notion?
Living it up ... living it up ... I can feel it
Living it up ... I got forward motion

I don't wanna go to war, I don't wanna go to war
I said I know what I want an' I don't wanna go to war
Do you follow me?
I saw a soldier standing in a bar, looked so tired, he'd come so far
He said "I need to love someone before they drop the atom bomb"

There's a girl at the back making eyes at me
And her hair long and black is a sight to see
But I get kind of scared when love's around
I just live for the groove 'til the sun goes down

Living it up ... living it up ... I can feel it
Living it up ... is it a false emotion?
Living it up ... living it up ... I can feel it
Living it up ... I got forward motion

So I'm-a-taking you out but I'm-a-faking
I'm married to the beat
To the music I gave the heart I could have given you-hoo
Still there's something 'bout the way that you move
And the way the people stare, it's the shock of the new
I want my friends to see me standing next to you

The sun goes down

Time is on my side
I don't care what they say, I'll enjoy the ride
But I get kind of scared when I turn around
So I'll stay with the groove 'til the sun goes down

Living it up ... living it up ... I can feel it
Living it up ... I got forward motion

Ooh watch her dance
There must be one like her in every club in every town
But I don't mind if that's the way she wants to be
There something 'bout her that reminds me of me
She's my soulmate - we'll be together 'til the sun goes down

The sun goes down

Living it up ... living it up ... I can feel it
Living it up ... I got forward motion
