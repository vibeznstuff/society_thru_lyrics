Come on, Mississippi
Mississippi, don't you reckon it's time
That the flag came down, cause the world turned round
And we can't move ahead if we're lookin' behind
Wanna know if you're with me, cause I come from a long long line
Of a rebel strain but the wind has changed
Mississippi, don't you reckon it's time

Look away, Mississippi
Mississippi, you're on my mind
All the crosses burned and the lessons unlearned
Left a scar across my heart and it's ten miles wide
Sick of sloggin' through the history of this wounded land of mine
Still payin' the cost cause the war was lost
Mississippi, don't you reckon it's time

I wish I was in a land that never held a soul in bondage ever
Wouldn't have to drag these chains behind 
Mississippi, it's time

What the hell, Mississippi
Mississippi, you're out of your mind
Mississippi goddamned, even Alabam'
South Carolina came across the line
Dixieland will never miss me but I whistle that tune sometimes
And I'll sing it loud when the flag comes down
Mississippi, don't you reckon it's time

Look away
Look away 
Look away Dixieland
