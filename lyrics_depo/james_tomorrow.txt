I see you falling
How long to go before you hit the ground
You keep on screaming
DonÂ´t you see me here
Am I a ghost to you

Now your grip's too strong
You can't catch love with a net or a gun
Gotta keep faith that your path will change
Gotta keep faith that your luck will change tomorrow
Tomorrow

Why are you phoning
What am I to do when you're miles away
You're always calling from the darkest moods and we're both scared

Now your grip's too strong
You can't catch love with a net or a gun
Gotta keep faith that your path will change
Gotta keep faith that your love will change

Now your grip's too strong
Can't catch love with a net or a gun
Gotta keep faith that your path will change
Gotta keep faith that your love will change tomorrow

I'm just out of your range
Tomorrow
All your suffering's in vain
Tomorrow

Now your grip's too strong
You can't catch love with a net or a gun
Gotta keep faith that your path will change
Gotta keep faith that your love will change tomorrow

I got out of your range
Tomorrow
All your suffering seems vain
Change tomorrow
Some forgiveness now
Tomorrow
Love's no sacred cow
