Won't you be elated
To tamper with our pride
They say to celebrate it
is social suicide
I'm not your average beat boy
I'm not your rebel guy
You want to make us hated
You want to make us slide
no clause 28
Brother you're much to late
I read about my future
And it don't look like fun
Now would you be so careless
to give a fool a gun
Don't need this legislation
You don't need this score
Don't need this facist groove
just to show pornography the door
Don't mean to be uptight
I don't mean to be precious
But tell me iron lady
are we moving to the right?
