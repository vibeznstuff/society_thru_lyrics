Ha ha
Oh yeah
Guess who's back
Marky Butt Butt on the track

You must be wondering, where have I been
But the truth is I'm so famous, now I can't be seen (stealing)
People stop and recognize me everywhere I go
From swimming pools to shopping malls, all around the globe

Up in Japan, down to Jamaica
I've got more fans than Kim Kardashian
From cupcake baker, to planet record breaker
I'm rising through the game like I'm in an elevator


I'm tripping over cash, it's always gonna last
Sometimes I even ask myself for an autograph
Blending all that green, looking hella lean
Moving to the palace, long live Marky Butt Butt the queen

It's all about the money, it's all about the fame
Cause all I hear is people, screaming out my name
Cause now I'm famous (aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah)
Yeah I'm so famous (aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah)


As soon as I wake up, I have to take a selfie
Post it to my millions, to see what they rate me
Counting all my money, takes me the whole day
So to pass the time, I listen to my own raps on replay

I don't leave the house, unless I'm in my chopper
And I only take showers, if its Fiji water
(2 chains)
Please I got 12 different pieces
And I only use them, for my dogs as leashes


I'm tripping over cash, it's always gonna last
Sometimes I even ask myself for an autograph
Blending all that green, looking hella lean
Moving to the palace, long live Marky Butt Butt the queen

It's all about the money, it's all about the fame
Cause all I hear is people, screaming out my name
Cause now I'm famous (aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah)
Yeah I'm so famous (aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah)
Cause now I'm famous (aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah)
Yeah I'm so famous (aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah)
Cause now I'm famous


Ha ha
My rap game's crazy
See me flying London to LA
Turning up in premium economy
(Premium economy)


Cause now I'm famous (aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah)
Yeah I'm so famous (aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah)
Cause now I'm famous (aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah, {we make it rain up in here}, aah-a-aah)
Yeah I'm so famous (aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah, {all day everyday}, aah-a-aah)
Cause now I'm famous (aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah)
Yeah I'm so famous (aah-a-aah, {you can't sit with us}, aah-a-aah, aah-a-aah)
Cause now I'm famous
