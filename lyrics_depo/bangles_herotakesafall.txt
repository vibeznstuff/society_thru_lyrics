The hero is exposed when
his crimes are brought to the light of day
Won't be feeling sorry,sorry,sorry
on the judgement day
It wasn't me who said
There'll be a price to pay
And I won't feel bad at all
When the hero takes a fall

Your mother told you stories
You substitute with girls who tell you more
Suddenly your sycophants are chanting
slogans at your door
We're seeing you through now
I saw it all before
And I won't feel bad at all 
When the hero takes a fall

Emotion is a virtue
For you it is the ole fatal flaw
Sitting on your throne
Drinking and thinking
She'll return your call
Every story's got an ending
Look out ! Here it comes, here it comes
And I won't feel bad at all
When the hero takes a fall
