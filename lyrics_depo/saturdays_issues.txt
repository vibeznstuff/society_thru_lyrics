Oh yeah

Sometimes, I feel like I'm going out of my mind
Boy the way you do me it's a damn crime
Then you smile at me and it's alright
With you there ain't no in-between
Every time that I walk out the door
Tell myself I won't take it no more
There's a part of me that won't let you go
Keep saying yes while my minds saying no

Me and my heart we got issues
Don't know if I should hate you or miss you
Damn I wish that I could resist you
Can't decide if I should slap  you or kiss you
Me and my heart we got issues, issues, issues
We got issues, issues, issues

It's so wrong, boy you left me hanging for so long
You empty out my love until it's all gone
You change the words but still is that the same song
I'm tired of the melody
Change my number and throw out your clothes
But my feeling for you it still shows
I keep building a wall round my heart
But then I see you and it all falls apart

Me and my heart we got issues
Don't know if I should hate you or miss you (damn I wish)
Damn I wish I could resist you (can't decide)
Can't decide if I should slap  you or kiss you (me and my heart)
Me and my heart we got issues, issues, issues (oh)
We got issues, issues, issues

Why fight it, can't hide it
Truth is I think I like it
Confusion, illusion
Still I don't know which way to go

Me and my heart we got issues
Don't know if I should hate you or miss you
Damn I wish that I could resist you
Can't decide if I should slap  you or kiss you (me and my heart)
Me and my heart we got issues (we gotta work this thing out)
Don't know if I should hate you or miss you (I don't know)
Damn I wish that I could resist you (yeah)
Can't decide if I should slap  you or kiss you
Me and my heart we got issues, issues, issues
We got issues, issues, issues
We got issues, issues, issues (me and my heart)
We got issues, issues, issues

Me and my heart we got issues
Don't know if I should hate you or miss you...
