Lovin' you
Has made my life much sweeter, baby
Baby, since I've got you
Everything is alright

When I'm lovin' you
I feel so good inside, ooh baby
When I make love to you
I'm in paradise, I'm in paradise, oh

You know you make me feel
You make me feel so good
From my head down to my toes

Sometimes I wanna shout
I wanna scream, tell the world about it
There's a girl in my mind
Your love is so good, so good, so good, so good to me

Needing you
I need you in everything I do
Baby, since I've got you
My life is complete

I'm in paradise, I'm in paradise
You know you make me feel
You make me feel so good
From my head down to my toes

And sometimes I wanna shout
I wanna scream, oh and tell the world about it
There's a girl in my mind
Your love is so good, so good, so good to me

Oh, lovin' you
Has made my life much sweeter baby
Baby, since I've got you
Everything is alright
Everything is alright

The way you love me
Feels so right
The way you hold me
Feels alright
Everything is alright

When you kiss me, baby
Everything, everything is just, just
Feels so good it's not true
Everything is alright

As long as I keep food on the table
Long as I keep the bills paid, baby
Long as I'm lovin' you
Long as you're lovin' me
Everything is alright

As long as I'm taking care of you, baby
And every little thing is alright

The way you love me
The way you hold me
The way you wrap your arms
Wrap your arms around me
