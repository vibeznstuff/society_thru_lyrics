Without you baby
I feel worthless
I'm livin on the edge
It's been an hour
Since you've been gone
And that's too long
So come back home
I can't live without you
So i'll cry for you
Do anything that i can
To feel that touch from your hand
Sorry that i want you
Lady what do i do



You know you're everything i do
Ooh yeah
Do what you want me to
I would do anything
Get on my knees for you
Ooooh, baby
What else is there to do
I don't know, i don't know
But i'll cry



Lady i, will cry for you tonight
Tonight

You spoil me girl
Like a child
When you're not here i can't even smile
I can't think without you
My mind is always with you
It's amazing what you do
To keep me falling in love with you
Girl you all that i know
Where else can i go

You know you're everything i do
Ooh wee
Do what you want me to
Anything you need from me baby
Get on my knees for you
Ohhh, ooooh, ohh
What else is there to do
I don't know, i don't know
But i'll cry
