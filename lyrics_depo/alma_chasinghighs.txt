2 AM, I'm fading in the dark
Like floating in the ocean
People need the poison
3 AM, you just touched my hand
And made me lose my focus
I almost didn't notice

And I better know what to do
Who's gonna be the first one to move?
I wanna get closer to you
(I wanna get closer to you)
And I better know what to do
Who's gonna be the first one to move?
I wanna get closer to you

I was chasing highs
'Till I found you
We're doing it in slow motion
We're doing it in slow motion
I was chasing highs
'Till I found you
You are getting closer in slow motion

I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-highs
I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-hi-highs
I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-highs
You are getting closer in slow motion

4 AM, almost touching you
Drowning at the noises
In between the voices
5 AM, there is something more
I caught the look you gave me
Faces going hazy

And I better know what to do
Who's gonna be the first one to move?
I wanna get closer to you
(I wanna get closer to you)
And I better know what to do
Who's gonna be the first one to move?
I wanna get closer to you

I was chasing highs
'Till I found you
We're doing it in slow motion
We're doing it in slow motion
I was chasing highs
'Till I found you
You are getting closer in slow motion

I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-highs
I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-hi-highs
I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-highs
You are getting closer in slow motion

I stopped counting the hours
Space between us getting smaller and smaller
I'm losing my powers
I'm falling higher and higher with you

I was chasing highs
'Till I found you
We're doing it in slow motion
We're doing it in slow motion
I was chasing highs
'Till I found you
You are getting closer in slow motion

I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-highs (ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-hi-highs (I'm chasing, I'm chasing)
I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-highs (ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
You are getting closer in slow motion
