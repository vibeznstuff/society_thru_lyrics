Sometimes they'll want to cut you down
Better scratch that itch, 'cause the time is now
They tell you that you got to have a heart of steel
If you want to keep up, can you afford to feel?

When the system's wrong, got to tear it down 
Let it fall to the seabed like a rusty crown
To the stars, in the moonbeams glare 
Shackles on your feet got to disappear

What if I tried to tell you to do what for?
Can't you see, baby, life's knocking right at your door
She said, ooh, I just don't know for sure
What if I tried to tell you to do what for?

Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up

She's got a talented face and a suitcase
Ain't got no desire to go no place
In her case she got no desire 
With her hand in the flame but she don't feel the fire
To the yes in the evening's air 
The demons in your head got to disappear
To the stars under the moonbeams glare
The shackles on your hand got to disappear

What if I tried to tell you to do what for?
Can't you see, baby, he's knocking right at your door
She said, ooh, I just don't know for sure
What if I tried to tell you to do what for?

Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't

What if I tried to tell you to do what for?
Can't you see, baby, life's knocking right at your door
Don't tell me, ooh, you just don't know for sure
What if I tried to tell you to
Don't give up
