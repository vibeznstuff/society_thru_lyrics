Life can rush you, 
It's all about just choosing the way,
Might sometimes rush you,
Cause you're looking for yesterday
So many reasons for looking for freedom
By living life and learning each day,
They will always be questions
That stay left un-answered,
But I work it out all the way,
Theres no time to grieve or feel sad about it
So left with only one thing to say


If you wanna see a broken heart,
Try looking in another place,
If you think you can be torn apart,
Try looking in another place

But don't mistake me for somebody
Whos caught up on you.

Love can steal you and hide the key and lock you away,
So many people don't ask the right questions,
There's always someone else there to blame,
Theres no time to grieve or feel sad about it,
So left with only one thing to say



So don't mistake me for somebody don't you take
Me for anybody don't confuse me for nobody
Whos caught up on you


If you wanna see a broken heart,
Try looking in another place,
If you think you can be torn apart,
Try looking in another place
