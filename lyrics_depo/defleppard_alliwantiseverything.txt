I don't know how to leave you 
And I don't know how to stay 
I've got things that I must tell you 
That I don't know how to say 

The man behind these empty words 
Is crying out in shame 
Holding on to this sinking ship 
When nothing else remains 

All I want is everything 
Am I asking too much? 
All I want is everything 
Like the feel of your touch 
But all I have are yesterdays 
Tomorrow never comes 

It's hard to hold your head up 
When you're kneeling down to pray 
And the talking dooesn't come easy now 
When the words get in the way 
And if you could see what's going on 
Behind these private eyes 
The truth would look so easy now 
But I'm running out of lies 





You think the shadow of doubt 
Is hangin' over my head 
It's just an angel whose wings hide the sun 
And it's myself I betray 
I can not wish this away 
Took my chance now the damage is done 

All I want is everything 
Am I asking too much? 
All I want is everything 
Like the feel, the feel of your touch 
When all I have are yesterdays 
Tomorrow never comes 

Ooh, oooh 
Ooh, oooh
