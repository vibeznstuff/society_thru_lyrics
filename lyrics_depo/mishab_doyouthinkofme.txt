I'll leave the light on,
In case you come back, in case you come back.
I'm pinning my hopes on you
Gotta believe that, yes I believe that.
It's been too long, I've tried to stay strong
But you're a life away
Do you hear me calling your name, yeah?


Every time the night falls down,
So do you wonder what I'm doing now
Do you think of me?
You didn't mean to let me down
I just wonder what you're doing now
Do you think of me?
At all (One heart, one love, one way)
At all (One heart, one love, one way)
Do you think of me?

I'm living by the telephone
You never call back
Why don't you call back?
I'm crying waterfalls
Gotta believe that
Why won't you come back?
It's been too long,
And I'll try to stay strong
But you're a life away
Do you hear me calling your name, yeah?


Every time the night falls down,
Do you wonder what I'm doing now?
Do you think of me?
You didn't mean to let me down
I just wonder what you're doing now
Do you think of me?
At all (One heart, one love, one way)
At all (One heart, one love, one way)
Do you think of me?

I never told you you're my
Somebody, everybody, somebody, everybody, somebody, everybody!
Want you to know that you're my
Somebody, everybody, somebody, everybody, somebody, everybody!
Yeah, do you think of me?


Every time the night falls down,
So do you wonder what I'm doing now
Do you think of me?
Oh leave me, let me down
See, I just want to do it now
Do you think of me?
I say oh, oh, and oh, oh
Do you think of me oh, oh?

I never told you you're my
Somebody, everybody, somebody, everybody, somebody, everybody!
I never told you you're my
Somebody, everybody, somebody, everybody, somebody, everybody!
Do you think of me?
