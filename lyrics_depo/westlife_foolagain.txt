Baby I know the story
I've seen the picture
It's written all over your face
Tell me, what's the secret
That you've been hiding
And who's gonna take my place

I should've seen it comin'
I should've read the signs
Anyway, I guess it's over

Can't believe that I'm the fool again
I thought this love would never end
How was I to know
You never told me
Can't believe that I'm the fool again
And I who thought you were my friend
How was I to know, you never told me

Baby, you should've called me
When you were lonely
When you needed me to be there

Sadly, you never gave me
Too many chances
To show you how much I care

I should've seen it comin'
I should've read the signs
Anyway, I guess it's over

Can't believe that I'm the fool again
I thought this love would never end
How was I to know
You never told me
Can't believe that I'm the fool again
And i who thought you were my friend
How was I to know, you never told me

About the pain and the tears
ohooooo, if i could I would
Turn back the time

oh yeah...

I Should've seen it comin'
I should've read the signs
Anyway, I guess it's over

Can't believe that I'm the fool again
I thought this love would never end
How was I to know
You never told me
Can't believe that I'm the fool again
And i who thought you were my friend
How was I to know, you never told me

Can't believe that I'm the fool again
I thought this love would never end
How was I to know
You never told me
Can't believe that I'm the fool again
And i who thought you were my friend
How was I to know, you never told me
