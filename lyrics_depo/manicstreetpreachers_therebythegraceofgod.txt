And all the drugs in the world
Can't save us from ourselves
Victims with the saddest hearts
Passing by the grace of God
There by the grace of God

With grace we will suffer
With grace we shall recover
There by the grace of God
There by the grace of God

Lay down all your guns
Give them up and then move on
It doesn't mean that you are dead
Passing by the grace of God
There by the grace of God

With grace we will suffer
With grace we shall recover
There by the grace of God
There by the grace of God

With grace we will suffer
With grace we shall recover
There by the grace of God
There by the grace of God
There by the grace of God

And all the drugs in the world

With grace we will suffer
With grace we shall recover
There by the grace of God
There by the grace of God

With grace we will suffer
With grace we shall recover
There by the grace of God
There by the grace of God

And all the drugs in the world
Can't save us from ourselves
Victims with the saddest hearts
Passing by the grace of God
There by the grace of God
