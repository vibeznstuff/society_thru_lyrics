Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the fun
Some guys have all the luck, all the luck
What you gonna do when your luck begins to run

Such a lucky dog it's good luck - push it
I get turned on by everything you do to me
Don't say you shouldn't do that
Push your hard luck hard push it

Oh, to take a kiss from lady luck tonight
Oh yeah I want to so much
Ooh the way it feels when you find out there's a pearl in it
Girl the way it feels when you get it

Some guys have all the luck
Some guys get all the fun
I get to hear you talk, see you walk
Ooh take me in your arms and let your luck begin to run

I touch you - alright
I thought my luck had held until you fingered me
We make a right impression when you hold me tight
Wait for a break, my lucky charm
Things are looking up alright - alright

Oh - to taste the lips of lady luck tonight
Oh yeah - I want to - so much
Ooh the way it feels when you find out there's a pearl in it
Girl the way you squeal when you get it

Some guys have all the luck
Some guys get all the breaks
I get to roll my dice - ain't it nice
Ooh take me in your kitchen and we'll play for higher stakes

Some guys have all the luck
Some guys get all the fun
I get to hear you talk, see you walk
Ooh take me in your arms and let your luck begin to run
