Superstar
Where you from? How's it going?
I know you got a clue what you're doing?
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here,
But I know what you are, what you are, baby

Look at you getting more than just a re-up
Baby, you got all the puppets with their strings up
Faking like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby

Womanizer, woman—womanizer
You're a womanizer, oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby
You, you, you are, you, you, you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer

Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
You got me goin'
You're, oh, so charmin'
But I can do it
Womanizer

Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
You say I'm crazy
I got your "crazy"
You're nothin' but a womanizer

Daddy-O
You got the swagger of a champion
Too bad for you
You just can't find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many, makes it hard
It could be easy, who you are
That's just who you are, baby

Lollipop
Must mistake me, you're a sucker
To think that I would be a victim not another
Say it, play it how you wanna
But no way I'm ever gonna fall for you, never you, baby

Womanizer, woman—womanizer
You're a womanizer, oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby
You, you, you are, you, you, you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer

Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
You got me goin'
You're, oh, so charmin'
But I can do it
You womanizer

Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
You say I'm crazy
I got your "crazy"
You're nothin' but a womanizer

Maybe if we both lived in a different world
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer
It would be all good,
And maybe I could be your girl,
But I can't 'cause we don't

Womanizer, woman—womanizer
You're a womanizer, oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby
You, you, you are, you, you, you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer

Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
You got me goin'
You're, oh, so charmin'
But I can do it
Womanizer

Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
You say I'm crazy
I got your "crazy"
You're nothin' but a womanizer

Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
Womanizer, woman—womanizer
You're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby
