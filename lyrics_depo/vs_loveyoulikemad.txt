Love you like mad!

When am with you girl
Im down with anything
I like the things that we do 
If you know what I mean

They way you turn me on
To the early morn

When we're all alone
We can make it right
Its like that everyday and every night
You touched my heart my body and soul

Ill be, everything that you want me to be
Ill do, everything that you want me to do
Ill say everything that you want me to say

I wana love you like this

I wana be your everything tonight 
I wana love you like mad

I wana love you like this
I wana love you like that
I wana be your everything tonight 
I wana love you like mad

When im with you boy
Im down with anything
I like the things that we do 
If you know what I mean

When you turn me on
To the break of dawn

When we're all alone
We can make it right
Its like that everyday and every night
You touched my heart my body and soul

Ill be, everything that you want me to be
Ill do, everything that you want me to do
Ill say everything that you want me to say

I wana love you like this

I wana be your everything tonight 
I wana love you like mad

Drop da ice spread it all across ya face
Take out da syrup spread all across ya spine
I hope you don't mind bout im about to take my time
La champaigne wine expensive and defined

The way your skin feels when its up against mine
Its something heaven sent ooo boy u feel devine
One touch boy your making me quiver
Sweat is dripping down your face cant wait till you deliver

I wana love you like that
I wana be your everything tonight 
I wana love you like mad

You're the one for me
Baby it's the way I feel

Baby it's the way I feel
You're the one for me
