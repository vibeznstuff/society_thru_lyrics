I wake up everyday it's a daydream
Everything in my life isn't what it seems
I wake up just to go back to sleep
I act real shallow but I'm in to deep
And all I care about is sex and violence
And a heavy bass line is my kind of silence
Everybody says I got to get a grip
But I let sanity give me the slip

Some people think I'm bonkers
But I just think I'm free
Man I'm just living my life
There nothing crazy about me
Some people pay for thrills but I get mine for free
Man I'm just living my life
There nothing crazy about me

Bonkers

I wake up everyday it's a daydream
Everything in my life isn't what it seems
I wake up just to go back to sleep
I act real shallow but I'm in to deep
And all I care about is sex and violence
And a heavy bass line is my kind of silence
Everybody says I got to get a grip
But I let sanity give me the slip

Some people think I'm bonkers
But I just think I'm free
Man I'm just living my life
There nothing crazy about me
Some people pay for thrills but I get mine for free
Man I'm just living my life
There nothing crazy about me

Mmmmmmmm

I wake up everyday it's a daydream
Everything in my life isn't what it seems
I wake up just to go back to sleep
I act real shallow but I'm in to deep
And all I care about is sex and violence
And a heavy bass line is my kind of silence
Everybody says I got to get a grip
But I let sanity give me the slip

Bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon

Some people think I'm bonkers
But I just think I'm free
Man I'm just living my life
There nothing crazy about me
Some people pay for thrills but I get mine for free
Man I'm just living my life
There nothing crazy about me
