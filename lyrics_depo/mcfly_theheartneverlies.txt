Some people laugh, some people cry
Some people live, some people die
Some people run, right into the fire
Some people hide their every desire
But we are the lovers

If you don't believe me
Then just look into my eyes
'cause the heart never lies

Some people fight, some people fall
Others pretend they don't care at all
If you wanna fight I'll stand right beside you
The day that you fall I'll be right behind you
To pick up the pieces

If you don't believe me
Just look into my eyes
'cause the heart never lies

Woah

Woah

Another year over, and we're still together
It's not always easy, but I'm here forever
We are the lovers

I know you believe me
When you look into my eyes
'cause the heart never lies
Hey

And we are the lovers
I know you believe me
When you look into my eyes
'cause the heart never lies

Oh-oh-woah
Woah

Another year over, and we're still together
It's not always easy, but I'm here forever

Yeah we are the lovers, I know you believe me
When you look into my eyes
'cause the heart never lies

'cause the heart never lies

Because the heart never lies
