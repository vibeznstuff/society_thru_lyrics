I came here tonight to get you out of my mind,
I’m gonna take what I find (uh oh, yeah!)
So open the box, don’t need no key I’m unlocked
And I won’t tell you to stop (uh oh, yeah!)

Hey boy!
I don’t need to know where you’ve been,
All I need to know is you and no need for talking
Hey boy!
So don’t even tell me your name,
All I need to know is whose place,
And let’s get walking...

All I wanna do is love your body
Oh oh oh oh
Tonight’s your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh oh oh oh

All I wanna do is love your body
Oh oh oh oh
Tonight’s your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh oh oh oh

It’s true what you heard, I am a freak, I’m disturbed
So come on and give me your worst (uh oh, yeah)
We’re moving faster then slow,
If you don’t know where to go,
I’ll finish off on my own (uh oh, yeah)

Hey boy!
I don’t need to know where you’ve been,
All I need to know is you and no need for talking
Hey boy!
So don’t even tell me your name,
All I need to know is whose place,
And let’s get walking...
Say say hey...

All I wanna do is love your body
Oh oh oh oh
Tonight’s your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh oh oh oh

All I wanna do is love your body
Oh oh oh oh
Tonight’s your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh oh oh oh

I think you already know my name
I think you already know my name

Hey hey, ha! Alright, say

I think you already know my name

All I wanna do is love your body
Oh oh oh oh (hey, hey,say)
Tonight’s your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh oh oh oh

All I wanna do is love your body
Oh oh oh oh
(Say, say, hey)
Tonight’s your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh oh oh oh
