A tattooed madman, I am hell on wheels
Born a wicked child left alone in the fields
My father was the wind, my mother was fire
Raised by the wolves and I grew up wild
A kamakazi man, a hollering "Banzai"
Never crash and born, never gonna die
Cannibal is me, ya squeal and shout
I chew ya up and spit ya out

Storms a c-c-coming and it's gonna be me
Here comes Trouble, with a capital "T"

Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man, riding the wind
And know I'll be damned
All the way, all the way
All the way

Chewbacca in the rye
The water of fire,
A terror in the flesh, a killer for hire
California man
I'm white line,"Homer"
The unruly one they call the "Blond Bomber"

Scooter gypsy, I'm a renegade
An orphan of the road
A live hand grenade
Never gonna quit before my time
When the moon gets high, then I'll be blind

Mad dog 20-20's king
I drink that stuff and start getting obscene

Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man
I gotta scream that's what I am
All the way all the way
Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man
Riding the wind and know I'll be damned
All the way, all the way, all the way

I'm a motorcycle man
Don't never give a damn
I lie when the truth serves better
The Marquis De Sade
I cheat and steal and rob
A Heavy Metal Creature

Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man
I gotta scream, that's what I am
All the way, all the way
Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man
I gotta scream, that's what I am
All the way, all the way
Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man
Riding the wind and know I'll be damned
All the way, all the way
