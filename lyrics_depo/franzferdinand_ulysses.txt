Well I sit here
Sentimental footsteps
and then a voice said hi, so,
So What ya got, what you got this time?
Come on let's get high
Come on 'lex oh

Walking 25 miles oh,
Well I'm Bored

Well I found a new way

C'mon don't amuse me

LA LA LA LA LA
Ulysses
I found a new way
Well I found a new way baby

My Ulysses

But last night was wild
Whats the matter there?
Feeling kinda anxious?
That hot blood grow cold
