I've been cryin' (boohoo)
'Cause I'm lonely (for you)
Smiles have all turned (to tears)
But tears won't wash away (the fears)
That you're never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns
It keeps me cryin', baby, for you,
Keeps me sighin', baby, for you

So, won't you hurry?
Come on, see about me
(Come see about me)
See about me baby
(Come see about me)

I've given up my friends just (for you)
My friends are gone and you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back and be mine
No matter what you do or say,
I'm gonna love you anyway,
Keep me cryin', baby, for you
Gonna keep sighin', baby, for you

Come on, hurry
Come on girl and see about me
(Come see about me)
See about you baby
(Come see about me)

Sometimes up (up, mm-hmm)
Sometimes down (down, mm-hmm)
My life's so uncertain (mm-hmm)
With you not around (mm-hmm)
From my arms, you may be out of reach
But my heart says you're here to keep
It keeps me cryin', baby, for you
Gonna Keep cryin', baby, for you

So, won't you hurry?
Come on, see about me
(Come see about me)
See about you baby
(Come see about me)

No matter what you do or say,
I'm gonna love you anyway,
Keep me cryin', baby, for you
Gonna keep sighin', baby, for you
Come on, hurry
Come on and see about me
(Come see about me)
See about me baby
(Come see about me)

You know I'm so lonely
(Come see about me)
I love you only
(Come see about me)
See about you baby
(Come see about me)
Come see about me
Come see about me
I Love You Only
Come see about me
Come see about me
