I do believe my eyes are telling me lies
I saw a ship ashore, a baked apple pie
Hide in corners and climbing up trees
Love is a big ship, following me

Big ship, following me
Love is a big ship, following me

Some like it cool, some like it hot
You see me cool, like a fool, with all the lovin' I got
Passing the world and the world's passing me
Love is a big ship, following me

Big ship, following me
Love is a big ship, following me

Just like, just like a big ship
Just like, just like a big ship
Just like, just like a big ship
Following me, following me

Make me feel good, while you're shakin' me down
Singers are singing dubidu all the town
Dubiduda, singing dubidudi
Love is a big ship, following me

Make me feel good, while you're shakin' me down
Singers are singing dubidu all the town
Dubiduda, singing dubidudi
Love is a big ship, following me

Big ship, following me
Love is a big ship, following me

Just like, just like a big ship
Just like, just like a big ship
Just like, just like a big ship
Following me, following me
Following me, following me
