Little mummy's boy
He wasn't very old
Though he was very small
He did what he was told

Jimmy Jimmy
Jimmy Jimmy - oh
Jimmy Jimmy
Poor little Jimmy wouldn't let go

He'd stay awake at night
Lying in his bed
No one ever listened
To a single word he said

Jimmy Jimmy
Jimmy Jimmy - oh
Jimmy Jimmy
Poor little Jimmy wouldn't let go

Silly boy
Silly boy
Silly boy
Such a silly boy

Jimmy Jimmy
Jimmy Jimmy - oh
Jimmy Jimmy
Poor little Jimmy wouldn't let go

Now little Jimmy's gone
He disappeared one day
But no one saw the ambulance
That took little Jim away

Jimmy Jimmy
Jimmy Jimmy - oh
Jimmy Jimmy
Poor little Jimmy wouldn't let go

Jimmy Jimmy
Jimmy Jimmy - oh
Jimmy Jimmy
Poor little Jimmy wouldn't let go
Poor little Jimmy wouldn't let go

Jimmy Jimmy
Jimmy Jimmy - oh
Jimmy Jimmy
Jimmy Jimmy - oh
Jimmy Jimmy
