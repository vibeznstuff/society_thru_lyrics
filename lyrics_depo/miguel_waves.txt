Uh set it up, keep wildin', runnin', jivin'
Baby drop it like it's stalling, stalling tonight

Body built for the beach, do you got that ocean?
Body surf, don't sleep, body surf on me

Don't stop, I wanna ride that wave
All night, I wanna ride that wave
Look here, wanna surf in it baby
Get turnt in it baby

Keep working it while I ride that wave

Put it out, I'm on fire, fire
