Tell me when will you be mine
Tell me quando, quando, quando
We can share a love divine
Please don't make me wait again

When will you say yes to me
Tell me quando, quando, quando
You mean happiness to me
Oh my love, please tell me when

Every moment's a day
Every day seems a lifetime
Let me show you the way
To a joy beyond compare

I can't wait a moment more
Tell me quando, quando, quando
Say it's me that you adore
And then darling, tell me when

Every moment's a day
Every day seems a lifetime
Let me show you the way
To a joy beyond compare

I can't wait a moment more
Tell me quando, quando, quando
Say it's me that you adore
And then darling, tell me when
Oh my darling, tell me when
My darling, tell me when

When
