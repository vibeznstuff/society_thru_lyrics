Had enough
Had enough
What the fuck?

It's a doubtful world
Where they embrace the lies
Hear the songs they sing
Are you hypnotized?
Can I sell you something
Let me tell you something
You see I come from nothing
And my hands are calloused
While the one percent
Stay tippin' the balance
I'm a put 'em on blast
For the present and past
Put the night stick away
Keep it off my back
What the fuck!
What the fuck!
What the fuck!

Pass ain't just past
World ain't gonna last
Change itself and thrive
Will he survive
Cyber metric hat trick
Trip on a back flip
Molotov matchsticks
Are burning Calabasas
Banksta clowns
Timmy C wrapped in a shroud
Shrapnel in a sound cloud
Body armor powwow
No ifs and no whats, no whos no hows
Support for crazy horse
We need you now
