Marilyn says I got nothing to wear tonight
Only a pair of diamond earrings that catch the light
Platinum blonde - is it true that you have more fun
Siberia - now I'm sad and all alone

Goddess of love
I can't go on without you - oh I want you
Goddess of love
Nobody cares like I do - what can I do?

Marilyn says all the best things in life are free
Speaking of friends, will you spend a little time with me?
Walking alone down the cold wet boulevard
Siberia - is the beating of your heart

Goddess of love
You make it hard to work out - when you want out
Goddess of love
You twist and tear my heart out - when you walk out
Never a day goes by
When I don't cry

Maybe I'll find a way - living from day to day
Look what you done tonight - Niagara Falls tonight

Goddess of love
I can't go on without you - oh I want you
Goddess of love
Nobody cares like I do - what can I do?
Never a day goes by
When I don't cry
