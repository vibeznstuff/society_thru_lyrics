My recipe is Jack Daniels,
Non-filtered Camels,
Crates full of samples,
Dutches and examples,
One Nike in the grave,
One Nike in the rave,
It all makes sense after the 'shrooms and the purple haze.

Ya muggin all silly, point in her face.
Old school puffin a philly.
Nothin to chase, Nothin to lose.
Solid ground stuck to my suit.
You can cut your split ends, you cant cut your roots.
Come on!
