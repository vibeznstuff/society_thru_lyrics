They were sitting like a string of pearls 
Decorating an illegal world 
But the one that took the poor man's plight 
Was a tuby in the night 

Mental anguish was her speciality 
She's a sadist of society 
And she'll tell you that tomorrow is gone 
Now the race has just begun 

One look in Madonna's eyes 
She can read your thoughts and can see through your mind 
One look in Madonna's eyes, she can't fill the rooms 
But empty lives 

Now the thinking what a waste of sin 
She's a live one better jump on in 
Twisted stories bodies clinging tight 
She's a tick-tock of the night 

When the fog has finally settled in 
She will baptise all the waiting men 
And it seems the competition is on 
Now the race has just begun 

One look in Madonna's eyes 
She can read your thoughts and can see through your mind 
One look in Madonna's eyes, she can't fill the rooms 
But empty lives
