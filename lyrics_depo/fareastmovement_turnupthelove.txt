We are one tonight
And we're breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We're turnin' up the love


Just turn it up now
Get get it poppin', hot tamale
Dirty bass, We so body body
Too legit, we can't quit the party
Super freaks, no Illuminati
So one, two, hit the booze
We on youtube, nothing to lose
So let it loose 'cause the sheep don't sleep
Like pop pop pop pop
Alright.


Drop low to the L O
V E gotta get more
So clap your hands, clap, clap your hands
I got nothing but love to give
Turn it up
Turned up you don't hear me no (hear me no)
Here's some love for your stereo (stereo)
So clap your hands, clap, clap your hands
I got nothing but love to give


We are one tonight
And we're breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We're turnin' up the love


We are one tonight
And we're breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We're turnin' up the love


Go ahead, now floss your love like a heart of gold
Dirty bass to bake a tootsie roll
If you don't low on the floor
I got a crew that will handle that cookie jar
Damn girl, I ain't tryin' to be rude
Spread love like a guest list, you plus two
That's what you call a move
Like pop, pop, pop, pop
Alright.


Drop low to the L O
V E gotta get more
So clap your hands, clap, clap your hands
I got nothing but love to give
Turn it up
Turned up you don't hear me, no
Here's a love for your stereo
So clap your hands, clap, clap your hands
Like pop, pop, pop, pop


Turn me on like this your song
Dirty bass got love to give
Turn it up now
Mad monopoly all night long
Dirty bass got love to give
Yo, let me see that grin from ear to ear
So much lovin' in the atmosphere
The good times roll with me right here
I got nothing but love to give


We are one tonight
And we're breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We're turnin' up the love
