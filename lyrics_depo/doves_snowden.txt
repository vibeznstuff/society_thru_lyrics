I said man, can you help me out? 
Bring me back to love 
Bring me back to life 

Oh why should I care? 

I said how, could you keep me out? 
Without a wish to share 
So without a doubt 

Oh then why should I care? 

We have been warned 
It's a classic sign 
It's a wicked mind 
With an axe to grind 

When is it our, our turn? 
So why should we care? 

Yeah we have been warned 
It's a classic sign 
Why should we care? 

If this is our last summer 
Oh then why should we care? 

If this could be our last summer 
Then why should we care?
