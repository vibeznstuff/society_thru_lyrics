Got to leave your seat, gotta get up upon your feet,
Gonna move ya to the rhythm till you never can stop.
We got the power, we got the music, and you betcha that we can use it,
Gonna take it rock-bottom, gonna take it to the top.

Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard,
And together we will take on all the world.
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard,
And together we will take on all the world.

Move a little nearer, you know you got to follow your leaders,
'Cause we need you, like you need us for sure.
We're gonna drive ya, we're gonna ride ya, we're gonna get right inside ya,
And if you wanna keep going, just shout out for more!

Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard,
And together we will take on all the world.
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard,
And together we will take on all the world.

Sing your song, we'll listen to you.
Sing your song, the spotlights on you.

Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard,
And together we will take on all the world.
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard,
And together we will take on all the world.

Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard,
And together we will take on all the world.
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard,
And together we will take on all the world.
