D A P's to the Y 

Nah Nah Frickin' 

And this is for my DAD!! 

Uncle B 

Yeah, I don't mean to bore, you know my name 
Chill for a second, just hear my pain 
If you've lost any loved ones you'll feel what I'm saying 
Hope its peacful down there where they layin 

When someone you loved, who brought you up from the start 
Built you up and made you into who you are 
Who always believed, saying that you'll be a star 
Then all of a sudden they just passed 

Dash the reaper from ontop of ma wardrobe 
Slap den crack, from side of the mouth 
Put me on stage infront of a crowd 
Now we're picking up awards whle he's under the ground 

My Daddy this and my Daddy that 
Well I found mine dead on a couch in ma flat 
So much to say, I wish I coulda said bye 
The only time I'll talk to him is when I look into the sky 

 YEAH!! 


All I've got is these pictures of ya 
And your light blue crack down Nokia 
Things in my house still smell of ya 
All I wanna say is: 

Papa if you can hear me...!! 
I regret every bad thing that I saaaid 
Please forgive me if you hear me... 
Never knew how much I loved ya till you was dead...!! 

Papa if you can hear me... 
 If only youuu, knew what you went and done 
Please forgive me if you hear me... 
 See all I know is, I'm proud to be your Son 
Papa if you can hear me... 


We're getting away in the world, it's how I'm flowing with N-Dubz 
If it wasn't for you B there wouldn't be N-Dubz 
Kept us together never knowing we'd end up 
Moving onto Mobo's pushing the bench up 
You pushed and pushed when no-one wanted to believe 
But back then it was all a dream 

It's like you sacrificed your life 
For the love of success and a life full of stress 
I'm vexed cuz 

First they love you, second they hate you 
They talked about you, when they tried to play you 
Behind your back they were tryna betray you 
But B, I never had a chance to repay you 
For the things you done for me 
Put me on the right path, kept me from steering left 
Yeah we had a right laugh 
But I be feeling like Bruce Willis, each and everyday I really wanna Die Hard 


All I've got is these pictures of ya

 Please forgive me if you hear me...!! 
 Please forgive me if you hear me...!!

Papa if you can hear me...!! 

Tulisa: I never ever hear what you said 
The fights and the laughter 
Success and disasters, No! 
But nothing seems clearer.. 
Than the day you were gone.. 

You said, despite all the stress 
You haveta fight to the death 
Coz little girl your a star 
Don't let em kill who you are.... 

You see you gave me a chance 
And now look where I am 
You are the reason, I can't wait to see you again...
