Late at night and all alone,
Late night traffics constant drone,
A voice comes on the telephone,
Yeah late at night and all alone,
It tells me quicken up , pick up the pace,
C'mon more speed and a little less haste,
Get along no time to waste,
Telephone voice calmly says,

Do ya wanna go faster baby,
Do ya wanna go faster,
Do ya wanna go faster baby,
Do ya wanna go faster,
Do ya wanna go faster baby,
Do ya wanna go faster,
Do ya wanna go faster baby,
Do ya wanna go faster,

Dancing down the motorway,
In the fast lane all the way,
I see the night turn into day,
I was dancing down the motorway,
Fast lane of the motorway,
Dancing faster night and day,
Fast lane of the motorway,

Do ya wanna go faster baby,
Do ya wanna go faster,
Do ya wanna go faster baby,
Do ya wanna go faster,
Do ya wanna go faster baby,
Do ya wanna go faster,
Do ya wanna go faster baby,
Do ya wanna go faster,

Nothings gonna ever slow us down,
When you're flying with your head ten feet off the ground,
No, Nothings gonna ever slow us down,
When you're flying with your head ten feet off the ground,

Do ya wanna go faster baby,
Do ya wanna go faster,
Do ya wanna go faster baby,
Do ya wanna go faster,
Do ya wanna go faster baby,
Do ya wanna go faster,
Do ya wanna go faster baby,
Do ya wanna go faster.
