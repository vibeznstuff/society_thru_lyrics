Southern nights
Have you ever felt a southern night
Free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistling tunes that you know and love so
Southern nights
Just as good even when closed your eyes
I apologize
To any one who can truly say
That he's found a better way

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed
Southern skies
It's precious beauty
Lies just beyond the eye
It goes running through the soul
Like the stories told of old

Old man
He and his dog that walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weeping willows would cry for joy
Joy

Feels so good
Feels so good it's frightening
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting
La-da-da-da-da, da-la-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da

Mystery
Like this and many others
In the trees
Blow in the night
In the southern skies

Southern nights
They feel so good it's frightening
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, la-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da...
