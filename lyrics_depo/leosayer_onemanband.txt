Everybody knows down Ladbroke Grove
You have to leap across the street
You can lose your life under a taxi cab
You gotta have eyes in your feet
You find a nice soft corner and you sit right down
Take up your guitar and play
Then the lawman comes and says move along
So you move along all day
I'm a one man band
Nobody cares nor understands
Is there anybody out there wanna lend a hand
To my one man band
For three days now I haven't eaten at all
My, my, I must be getting so thin
Soon my cap won't be large enough
To drop a half-a-crown in
So hey there mister don't you look so sad
Don't look so ill at ease
When I can play you any song you like
To cheer up the life you lead
I'm a one man band
Nobody cares nor understands
Is there anybody out there wanna lend a hand
To my one man band
And oh, oh, oh, look at the rain falling
Oh, oh, oh look at it rain
Oh look at it rain
Nobody sees the minstrel boy
As he sings his tale of woe
Nobody sees him coming, nobody sees him go
So hey there mister don't you look so sad
Don't look so ill at ease
When I can play you any song you like
To cheer up the life you lead
I'm a one man band
Nobody cares nor understands
Is there anybody out there wanna lend a hand
To my one man band
