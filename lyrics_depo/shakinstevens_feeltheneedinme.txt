See how I'm walking
See how I'm talking
You'll notice everything in me
Feel the need
Feel the need in me
Whoawhoayeah Haa

I need you by my side
To be my guide
Can't you see my arms are open wide
Feel the need
Feel the need in me

I need your love
Everyday I need it
Everyway I need it
Without your sweet sweet love I'd gladly die

I need you constantly
Your love is good to me
Your love is sweeter to me than apple pie

Just put your hand in mine
Love me all the time
The truth you will plainly see
Feel the need
Feel the need in me

Haa

Your love is tough now
Can't get enough
'Cos your loves so important to me
Feel it
Feel the need in me

I need you by my side
To be my guide
Can't you see my arms are open wide
Feel the need
Yeah feel the need in me

I need your love
Everyday I need
Everyway I need
Without your sweet sweet love I'd gladly die

I need you constantly
Your love is good to me
Your love is sweeter to me than apple pie

Just put your hand in mine
Love me all the time
The truth you will plainly see
Feel the need
Feel the need in me
Yeah

Come on and feel it
Come on baby feel it
Come on and feel it
Ahh that's nice
Ooww
Ah that's good
Ahh your doing well
Ah that's nice
