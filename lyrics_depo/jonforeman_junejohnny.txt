Coming down the highway like a fright
Laughing three o’clock at night
With the desert stars above
Singing June and Johnny's songs
You felt pretty, I felt strong
And no one called our bluff
And love was a simple song

And I'll hold you all my life
Like a memory at the back of my mind

Summers come and go so fast
Close your eyes the moment's past
And another year is gone
We built our castles in the sand
The higher tide had other plans
But I'm still holding on
And love was a fragile song

And I'll hold you all my life
Like a memory at the back of my mind

Darling nothing stays the same
We were born without a name
And that’s the way we'll die
But even when the memories fade
What we have is still ingrained
It's written down inside
And love was our timeless song

And I'll hold you all my life
Like a child asking why
And I'll hold you all my life
Like a memory at the back of my mind
Just a memory at the back of my mind
