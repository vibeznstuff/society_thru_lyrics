I'm becoming less defined as days go by
Fading away
And well you might say
I'm losing focus
Kinda drifting into the abstract in terms of how I see myself

Sometimes I think I can see right through myself 
Sometimes I can see right through myself

Less concerned about fitting into the world
Your world that is
Cause it doesn't really matter anymore
(no it doesn't really matter anymore)
No it doesn't really matter anymore
None of this really matters anymore

Yes I am alone but then again I always was
As far back as I can tell
I think maybe it's because
Because you were never really real to begin with
I just made you up to hurt myself


I just made you up to hurt myself, yeah
And I just made you up to hurt myself

And it worked.
Yes it did!


There is no you
There is only me 
There is no you
There is only me 
There is no fucking you
There is only me
There is no fucking you
There is only me

Only 

Well the tiniest little dot caught my eye and it turned out to be a scab 
And I had this funny feeling like I just knew it's something bad
I just couldn't leave it alone, I kept picking at the scab
It was a doorway trying to seal itself shut
But I climbed through

Now I am somewhere I am not supposed to be, and I can see things I know I really shouldn't see
And now I know why, now, now, now I know why 
Things aren't as pretty
On the inside



Only
