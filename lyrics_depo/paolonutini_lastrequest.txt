Slow down, lie down,
Remember it's just you and me.
Don't sell out, bow out,
Remember how this used to be.

I just want you closer,
Is that alright?
Baby, let's get closer tonight


Grant my last request,
And just let me hold you.
Don't shrug your shoulders,
Lay down beside me.
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere,
But one last time let's go there,
Lay down beside me

Oh, I've found, that I'm bound
To wander down that one way road.
And I realise all about your lies
But I'm no wiser than the fool that I was before.

I just want you closer,
Is that alright?
Baby, let's get closer tonight



Oh, baby, baby, baby,
Tell me how can, how can this be wrong?



Yeah, lay down beside me.

One last time let's go there,
Lay down beside me
