You say it was like this
I was torn between 2 worlds
One full of promise
And the truth I knew would hurt
You say I'm no angel
Tryin to put the past behind

So now I try to find
A place to leave all
Memories in my mind
We try, our lives away
Then stumble into the grave
We cry, and still they stay
The past won't go away
The story of my life

See I was just thinkin
Now my life is on the road
The straight and the narrow
On the route that I've been showed
You know its not easy
To try to change your ways

So now I try to find
A place to leave all
Memories in my mind
We try, our lives away
Then stumble to the grave
We cry, and still they stay
The past won't go away
The story of my life

A place to leave all
Memories in my mind
We try, our lives away
Then stumble to the grave
We cry, and still they stay
The past won't go away
The story of my
Try, our lives away
Then we stumble to the grave
We cry, and still they stay
The past won't go away
The story of my life
