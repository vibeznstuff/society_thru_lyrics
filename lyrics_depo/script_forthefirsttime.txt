She's all laid up in bed with a broken heart,
While I'm drinking jack all alone in my local bar,
And we don't know how,
How we got into this mad situation,
Only doing things out of frustration

Trying to make it work but man these times are hard

She needs me now but I can't seem to find the time,
I've got a new job now on the unemployment line,
And we don't know how,
How we got into this mess
Is it God's test?
Someone help us 'cause we're doing our best,

Trying to make it work but man these times are hard

But we're gonna start by
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine,
 Sit talking up all night,
 Shit talking up all night,
Saying things we haven't for a while
A while, yeah,
We're smiling but we're close to tears,
Even after all these years,
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting for the first time

Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Ooooooh

She's in line at the DOLE*
With her head held high (high)
While I just lost my job but
Didn't lose my pride

But we both know how,
How we're gonna make it work when it hurts,
When you pick yourself up,
You get kicked to the dirt,

Trying to make it work but
Man, these times are hard,

But we're gonna start by
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine,
 Sit talking up all night,
 Shit talking up all night,
Doing things we haven't for a while,
A while yeah,
We're smiling but we're close to tears,
Even after all these years,
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting for the first time.

Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Ooooooh

Yeah...
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine,
 Sit talking up all night,
 Shit talking up all night,
Saying things we haven't for a while,
We're smiling but we're close to tears,
Even after all these years,
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting for the first time

Ooooo,.. yeah, for the first time
Ooooo,.. oh, for the first time,
Ooooh,.. yeah, for the first time,
(Just now got the feeling that we're meeting for the first time)

Oh these times are hard,
Yeah, they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me baby

Oh these times are hard,
Yeah, they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me baby

Oh these times are hard,
Yeah, they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me baby

Oh these times are hard,
Yeah, they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me baby
