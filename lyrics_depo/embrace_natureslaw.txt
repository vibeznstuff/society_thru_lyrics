I tried to fight the feeling, the feeling took me down
I struggle and I lost the day you knocked me out
Now everything's got meaning, the meanings bring me down
I'm watching as a screening of my life plays out

Every day I fight these feelings
For your sake I will hide the real thing
You can run all your life, all mine I will chase

You should never fight your feelings
When your very bones believe them
You should never fight your feelings
You have to follow natures law

I'll live with never knowing, if knowings gonna change
I'll stop a feeling growing, I will stay away
Like a broken record, stuck before a song
A million beginnings, none of them the one

Every day I fight these feelings
For your sake I will hide the real thing
You can run all your life, all mine I will chase

You should never fight your feelings
When your very bones believe them
You should never fight your feelings
You have to follow natures law

I wrote her letters and tried to send them
In a bottle I place my hope
An S.O.S full of good intentions sinking
Will you give it to me, don't make me wait
You built me up, knocked me down
But I will stand my ground
And guard this light that I've found

You should never fight your feelings
When your very bones believe them
If you let them show, you'll keep them
I know your hurt but soon you'll rise again, again, again:.
