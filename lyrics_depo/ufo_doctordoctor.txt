Doctor doctor, please
Oh, the mess I'm in
Doctor doctor, please oh, the mess I'm in
She walked up to me and really stole my heart
And then she started to take my body apart

 Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you

Doctor doctor, please
Oh I'm goin' fast
Doctor doctor, please, oh, I'm goin' fast
It's only just a moment
She's turning paranoid
That's not a situation for a nervous boy

 Doctor doctor, please
Oh, the mess I'm in
Doctor doctor, please oh, the mess I'm in
But you look so angry as I crawled across your floor
She's got the strength, and I can't take any more
