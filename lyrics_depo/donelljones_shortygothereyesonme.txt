Ooh, ooh... 
Ooh, ooh... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... 
Whoa, whoa... 
Whoa, whoa...Yeah... 
Listen baby 


Up in the place I see you getting down 
Can't help but look at you 
Gotta crowd around you 
Now you're the baddest thing I've seen tonight 
So come on girl let's put it in flight 
I got the V-1-2, 6-4-0 
Sitting outside of the door 
So bring it on, by the way 
Your body's plays for 
I like the little thing around your navel


It's a quarter past three 
Girl, what's it gonna be 
Shorty got her eyes on me 
We've been talking since two 
Girl, what'cha gonna do 
Tell 'em that you're riding with me 
It's a quarter past three 
Girl, what's it gonna be 
Shorty got her eyes on me 
You've been fronting since two 
Girl, what'cha gonna do 
I'll be chillin' at the Embassy, what 


I'm watching you move 
I stop to fantasize 
About the way I'm gonna put it on that ass tonight
So come on and ride shotgun 
I got the bubbles if you like it we can pop some 
I see me and you, flossing in my coupe 
Maybe we can peel back the roof 
And get it on 
And I see your body's plays for 
I like the little thing around your navel, baby 




All I know is I'm not leaving here alone, yeah 
Now you might be the baddest in the club to me 
But shorty's got it bad and wanna slide with me tonight 
So what'cha gonna do 
Is it gonna be me and you 
You got to stop playing games 
Girl, you got to stop faking me, ooh
