So much love to give
So won't you come and get it

Bring your body, undressed and yearnin'
Got the candles burnin', baby, I'm determined

Tickle, ride and pat it, your goodness and your savvy
You know I'm gonna answer your request

We're not close to endin' (No), it is just beginnin'
(Oh, yeah)
We're stretchin' out the episode (Oh), let me do it
one more time

Downtown, even lower, pick you up over my shoulders

Ride you in a rollercoaster, ooh, you're so wet
That just made me more excited, girl, you got my fire lighted
Since you tried it, I'm gonna shock you, go

Let me go deep, deep, deep, deep

Wanna go deep (Deep), deep , deep (Oh), deep
Make your body quiver just right (Just right)

You got my head spinnin' , the way my body's
twistin' (Twistin')
Give in to me, baby boy, oh...

Let me go deep, deep {Deep}, deep {Oh...}, deep
Just give it to me, girl, give it to me, girl
Wanna go deep, deep, deep, deep
