She's an American beauty
I'm an American psycho
She's an American beauty
I'm an American
I'm an American
American Psycho
(Whoa whoa whoa)
I'm an American
I'm an American
I'm, I'm, I'm an American psycho

I think I fell in love again
Maybe I just took too much cough medicine
And I'm the best worst thing that hasn't happened to you yet
The best worst thing (whoa)

You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
And you can kill me, kill me or let God sort 'em out
And you can kill me, kill me or (whoa)

She's an American beauty
I'm an American psycho
She's an American beauty
I'm an American
I'm an American
American Psycho
(Whoa whoa whoa)
I'm an American
I'm an American
I'm, I'm, I'm an American psycho
(Whoa whoa whoa)
I'm an American
I'm an American
I'm, I'm, I'm an American psycho

I wish I dreamt in the shape of your mouth
But it's your thread count I really care about
Stay up 'til the lights go out
Stay up, stay up

You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
And as we're drifting off to sleep all those dirty thoughts of me
They were never yours to keep, keep (whoa)

Alter boys, altered boys
We're the things that love destroys
(I'm an American, I'm an American)
You, me, us, them
We're just resurrection men
(I'm an American, I'm an American)
Us, we were only meant
To make you live again
(I'm an American, I'm an American)
Us, we were pity sex,
Nothing more and nothing less
(I'm an American)

She's an American beauty
I'm an American psycho
She's an American beauty
I'm an American
I'm an American
American Psycho
(Whoa whoa whoa)
I'm an American
I'm an American
I'm, I'm, I'm an American psycho
