Well, I've wondered around after hour of words
And I'm waiting in vain here for weeks.
The ghost of the girlfriend is here in my room
I can still smell her perfume in my sheets
But that's not her in my bed,
though she's out of the town
And I don't want anyone to see
There's a tattoo of my name on her body
But honestly, the man holding her hand isn't me

Oh honey how could you regret me
When you can't even forget me?
But it's OK to say that you love me
I think of you, still think of you
OK, say that you love me,
I think of you, still thinking of you

I thought that once you had one you had every woman
Until I lost this legendary woman, now I'm sure
That they don't make 'em like her anymore
So please baby, please love
Let's find a way to forgive each other
I got out of hand ever since you're gone
Without you I'm still alone

Oh how could you regret me
When you know you can't forget me?
But it's OK to say that you love me
I think of you, still think of you
OK, say that you love me,
I think of you, still thinking of you

I make mistakes I'm only human
And I am not ashamed to say
That you are the one
But it's OK, to say that you love me,
I think of you, still think of you
But it's OK to say that you love me
I think of you, still think of you

It's OK, it's OK, say that you love me, yeah
Say you love me.
