Just a Perfect Day
Drank Sangria in the Park
And Later, when it gets dark
We go Home

Just A Perfect Day
Feed Animals in the Zoo
And Later, a movie too
And then Home

It's Such a Perfect Day
I'm Glad I spent it with you
Such a Perfect Day
You Just keep me hanging on
You Just keep me hanging on

Just a Perfect Day
Problems all Left Alone
Weekenders on our own
Such Fun

Just a Perfect Day
You made me forget myself
I thought I was someone else
Someone new

It's Such a Perfect Day
I'm Glad I spent it with you
Such a Perfect Day
You Just keep me hanging on
You Just keep me hanging on

You're gonna reap just what you sow.
