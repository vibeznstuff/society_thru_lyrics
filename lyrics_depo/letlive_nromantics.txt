Now tell me, lady, do you feel at all? (do you feel at all?)
For all the lazy, for those you can’t write off (write them off...)
I’m feeling, lately, like you’ve been giving up (like you’ve given up) 
on every labored hand here in our promised land, on the backs we whipped then covered up

It’s not that far away, it’s not that far away
Every single time I think we’ve made it, I feel the decline I’m proudly jaded, but 
It’s not that far away, it’s not that far away
Every single time I think we’ve made it, our fantasy fades away

Grace was amazing until our faith ran out (until our faith right out)
Justice, you’re playing me for bigger bank accounts (big accounts...)
Cocaine arrangements, ghettos, and hand-me-downs (they were handed down)
She’s always got a plan to use her fellow man, no use believing in what she says, 

It’s not that far away, it’s not that far away
Every single time I think we’ve made it, I feel the decline I’m proudly jaded, but 
It’s not that far away, it’s not that far away
Every single time I think we’ve made it, our fantasy fades away

Now I’ve got it and I’ve lost everything
Every single time I think we’ve made it, I feel the decline, I’m proudly jaded, but 
It’s not that far away, it’s not that far away
Every single time I think we’ve made it, our fantasy fades away

These tired and poor, you said to bring them all to you
They’re all waiting for you to reap what you sow
These tired and poor, you said to bring them all to you (it’s all for you)
They’re all waiting for (we’re all waiting for) you to reap what you sow
