There must be something we can eat
Maybe find another lover
Should I fly to Los Angeles
Find my asshole brother

Mickey mouse has grown up a cow
Dave's on sale again
We kissy kiss in the rear view
We're so bored
You're to blame

Try to see it once my way
Everything Zen
Everything Zen
I don't think so

Rain dogs howl for the century
A million dollars at stake
As you search for your demi-god
And you fake with a saint
There's no sex in your violence
There's no sex in your violence
Try to see it once my way
Everything Zen
Everything Zen
I don't think so

I don't believe that Elvis is dead
I don't believe that Elvis is dead
I don't believe that Elvis is, Elvis is

There's no sex in your violence
