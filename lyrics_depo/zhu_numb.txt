Love me 'til I'm numb, baby
We gon' sip on this wine

In the morning light, let's go one more time
One more time

In the morning light, let's go one more time
One more time

But I'm into you, I'll connect to you
Help me numb the pain of feeling reclused
Girl, you know what to do, I'll connect to you
