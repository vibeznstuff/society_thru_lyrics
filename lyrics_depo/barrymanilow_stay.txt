Do you remember how we used to be
Before we lost the dream of you and me
From the very start you took my breath away
So tonight let's bring back yesterday
Darlin' stay
Why don't you be with me tonight

Stay
We can make love til the morning light
Baby stay
I can make everything alright Just tell me what to say
'Cause I really don't want you to go
You used to laugh and say sweet things to me
You made me happy as a man can be
Hold me in your arms like you did then
Make the memory live all over again
Darlin' stay
Why don't you be with me tonight

Stay
We can make love til the morning light
Baby stay
I can make everything alright
Just tell me what to say
'Cause I really don't want you to go
Darlin' stay
Why don't you be with me tonight

Stay
We can make love til the morning light
Now stay
I can make everything alright
Just tell me what to say
'Cause I really don't want you to go
Darlin' stay
Why don't you be with me tonight

Stay
We can make love til the morning light
Now stay
I can make everything alright
Just tell me what to say
'Cause I really don't want you to go
