You think you've got it all set up
You think you've got the perfect plan
To charm everyone you see
And playing any game you can

But I've got news for you
I hope it don't hit you too hard
One of these days while you're at play
I'm gonna catch you off guard

I'm gonna tear
Your playhouse down
Pretty soon
I'm gonna tear
Your playhouse down
(The way you are)
Room by room

You make our lives
A stress and strain
Using the power ploy
All you do is pass around
The hearts you use as play toys

You've been playing madly
With every mind in town
So what you gonna do
When you look up one day
And see your playhouse tumbling down

I'm gonna tear
Your playhouse down
Pretty soon
I'm gonna tear
Your playhouse down
(The way you are)
Room by room

You think you've got it all set up
You think you've got the perfect plan
To charm everyone you see
And playing any game you can

You've been playing madly
With every mind in town
Oh, what you gonna do
When you look up one day
And see your playhouse tumbling down

I'm gonna tear
Your playhouse down
Pretty soon
I'm gonna tear
Your playhouse down
(The way you are)
Room by room

I'm gonna tear
Your playhouse down
Pretty soon
I'm gonna tear
Your playhouse down
(The way you are)
Room by room
