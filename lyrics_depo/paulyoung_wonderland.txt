For all your worried weaknesses,
All will be revealed
And for all your troubled sweetnesses,
Your troubles will be healed...

Close your eyes,
Close your eyes (oh, now...)
Let me rise,
Let me rise (oh)

I see you in a dress of blue,
With a question in your hand
I see you in your attitude,
Of sorrow and demand... (oh)

Close your eyes,
Close your eyes...

Let me take you
Back to wonderland
I will take you
Back to wonderland...

Wherever there's an empty space,
Split the time in two
And when you come to claim your place
I'll see you smiling through

Hold my hand,
Hold my hand...

Let me take you
Back to wonderland
I will take you
Back to wonderland...

Are your eyes so tired of searchin',
Ah, that they can't see love?... and...
Is your heart so full of locks and keys
That it can't open up? (open your heart)

Through all the things that have to be,
We often have to cry
And beneath the weight of gravity,
We stumble then we fly...

Hold my hand,
Hold my hand...

Let me take you
Back to wonderland
I will take you
Back to wonderland...

Let me take you
Back to wonderland (let me take you back)
I will take you
Back to wonderland...

Let me take you
Back to wonderland (I wanna take you)
I will take you
Back to wonderland...
