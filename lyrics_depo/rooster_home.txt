I like to live life in motion
No time for slowing down
No time to turn around
Im just a wave on this ocean
Moving fast until the day that I come crashing down
But I wont make a sound
Sometimes we all feel broken 
And we need a place to hide


I find my way home
Every road that takes me takes me home
To a place I know my time is mine alone
Home
I find my way home
Cause you know its good to get your feet back on the ground


I need to see new horizons
Watch the red eye setting fire to a thousand skies
Makes me feel alive
I spread my wings free fall diving
And I am constantly reminded that
Sometimes we all feel broken
And we need a place to hide




Its time to save me from myself 
Lock me up inside
Floating on a feeling I cant hide
I find my way home 


I find my way home
Every road that takes me takes me home
To a place I know my time is mine alone
Home
I find my way home
Cause you know its good to put your feet down
