They said your cheating heart will make me cry
And like a fool I gave it a try
I should've listened when they told me so
Many many tears ago

But I could not believe the things they said
Because my heart over ruled my head
I should've listened when they told me so
Many many tears ago

I laughed out loud when they told me
That you had someone else
But your cheating heart has shown me
That I was foolin myself

I know it's too late for a brand new start
For I have cried you out of my heart
I should've listened when they told me so
Many many tears ago

I laughed out loud when they told me
That you had someone else
But your cheating heart has shown me
That I was foolin myself

I know it's too late for a brand new start
For I have cried you out of my heart
I should've listened when they told me so
I should've listened when they told me so
Many many tears ago
