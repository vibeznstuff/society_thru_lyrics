Ring-a-ding-ding you're out of school
Bringing those pink soled jiving shoes
Teacher said no words you'll find
Educated on rock and jive
Slide right up to overdrive
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to roll?
Well there ain't no one to bring my baby home

Get along to that crazy spot
Down to the juke joint where it's hot
I sure dig that cat Ramone
When he plays that saxophone
Boy that band is really gone
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to roll?
Well there ain't no one to bring my baby home

Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to roll?
Well there ain't no one to bring my baby home

Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to roll?

Get it up, play it up all you got
Keep it up, play it now cool and hot
History classes can make you mad
Tell them Eddy ain't going away
Pick up your shoes and graduate

Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to roll?
Well there ain't no one to bring my baby home

Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to roll?
Well there ain't no one to bring my baby home
Well there ain't no one to bring my baby home
