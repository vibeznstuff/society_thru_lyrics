Last night me n my dawgs were hanging out
Tired of being cramped up in the house
We were simply celebrating life
Off from work today so it's alright
But all those ups n downs had me in a twist
Started dancing wit this model chick
And then every record became my favorite song
And that is all that I remember


Cuz I had one too many drinks
And ended up at the embassy
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee
It was a one night extravaganza


When I woke up from last night's avoutrie
Baby girl was layin next to me
Shoes n clothes were scattered everywhere
I got dressed n got up out of there
But not before I called for me a cab
Hung over from all the drinks I had
And now I'm telling my story to u
Everything that I remember


Cuz I had one too many drinks
And ended up at the embassy
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee
It was a one night extravaganza
I had one too many drinks
And ended up at the embassy
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee
It was a one night extravaganza

Extravanganzaaa
Extravavganzaaa
Only was an extravaganza
yes it was the things that I remember


And I remember bein at da bar tryna ask what dat hypno hit fo' (hit fo')
Knowin I cant afford to get mo' (get mo')
Here's a broke niggah trick buy one bottle and sip slow
Or, or leave da club now, do like I did, come back when u get dough
A fishstick niggah now we messin wit lobster
We messin wit Grammies we messin wit Oscars
We messin wit dat dranky drank
Plus u puffin on da stanky stank
In the mornin u gon draw a blank
The hotel said ya was on one
My girl wasn't on shit I picked the wrong one
'Stead he talkin bout I ain't like them other girls
Well tonight I'm tryna find them other girls
Bring they own rubba girl
Never meet ya motha girl
You know they luv it when u luv em when they tell they friends giirrl


I had one too many drinks (I had one too many (u know they gon blame it on the drinks))
And ended up at the embassy (u no the excuse is to do excatly wat u want)
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee (J.Foxx, Kanye to da)
It was a one night extravaganza (And the winners are)
I had one too many drinks (thats BSP baby, we got black star power in the room right now)
And ended up at the embassy (easy, easy, be very easy)
Wuith this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee (calm down please)
It was a one night extravaganza (I aint c da periods)
I had one too many drinks
