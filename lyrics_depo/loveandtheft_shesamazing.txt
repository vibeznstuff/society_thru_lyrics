A char on the porch
That sun comin' up
Warm on my face
I'm thanking god for my luck

She walks through the door
Wrapped up in a sheet
Floating on air
An Angel in her bare feet
Leaving me speechless


She's the light at dawn
She's the cloud I'm on
She's amazing
Mona Lisa's smile
She's so innocent and wild
She's amazing, yeah
She's Amazing

Her eyes say it all
There's something to see
I can't stop staring
Her staring back at me
The world doesn't matter
Nothing else matters



Amazing
So Amazing



She's Amazing
She's Amazing
