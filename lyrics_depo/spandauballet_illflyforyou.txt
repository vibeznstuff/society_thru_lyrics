Passion take the wind
and break me from this tie
we're mortals on the earth
oh but God's up in the sky
I haven't got a clue
I haven't got a thing
but what I give to you
is all that I could bring

I'll give you all my time
that's everything to me
you know my only crime
is this flight of fantasy

because I've nothing else here for you
and just because it's easier than the truth
oh if there's nothing else that I can do
I'll fly for you
because I've nothing else here for you
and just because it's easier than the truth
oh if there's nothing else that I can do
I'll fly for you

Passion take the wind

oh if there's nothing else that I can do
I'll fly for you
I'll fly for you
I'll fly...

I'm just an average boy
you're more than an average girl and
when you sing to me the 'shoo be doos'
you sing so well
and don't you know that when I'm under you
I'm overjoyed

because I've nothing else here for you
and just because it's easier than the truth
oh if there's nothing else that I can do
I'll fly for you
because I've nothing else here for you
and just because it's easier than the truth
oh if there's nothing else that I can do
I'll fly for you
I'll fly for you
I'll fly for you
I'll fly
