Run away from all your boredom
Run away from all your whoredom and wave
Your worries, and cares, goodbye
All it takes is one decision
A lot of guts, a little vision to wave
Your worries, and cares goodbye

It's a maze for rats to try 
It's a race, a race for rats
A race for rats to die
It's a race, a race for rats
A race for rats to die

Sick and tired of Maggie's farm
She's a bitch, with broken arms to wave
Your worries, and cares, goodbye

It's a maze for rats to try 
It's a race, a race for rats
A race for rats to die
It's a race, a race for rats
A race for rats to die 
Burn away
Run away
