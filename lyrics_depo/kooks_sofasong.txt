The city freeze before
I just realised I don't like you
Me and my girl
Are going out for some air
And I will do my best
Just to get under her dress
And catch you out if I can
On the other side of my sofa

Won't you come on over
At the side of my sofa
Oh won't you come on over

The city heated it up
It got blurry cause I'd had enough
And he tried to take your soul
But didn't realise you keep it in a different hole

Won't you come on over
At the side of my sofa
Oh won't you come on over

So here he comes, a man with
A loaded gun, I don't know if he
Wants my soul or my
Cash flow, I s'pose I don't know

So here he comes, a man with a
A loaded gun I don't know if he
Wants my girl's heart or her pearls
I s'pose I don't know
I s'pose I don't know
I s'pose I don't know
I s'pose I don't know
I s'pose I don't know
