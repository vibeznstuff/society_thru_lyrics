Tired and weary and fraying at the seams
So disillusioned
I'd forgotten how to dream for just a while
I knew a change would have to come.
So wrapped up in myself
That I couldn't see the truth
But the moment I looked up
I knew I'd seen the future in your eyes
And my life had just begun.

Cos they can take away the sun and rain
And everything I've ever owned
Let them have it all
Cos you give me something more
A love worth dying for.

It's been such a long time since I felt so strong inside
I know you're the reason
And the words can't quite express the way I feel
But they're all I have to use.
Oh!
Cos there ain't nothing in this Universe
Can hold a candle next to you
And now my life's complete
Since you opened up the door
With a love worth dying for.

In the morning when the sunlight hits your face
It's such a beautiful collision that nothing could replace.

Cos they can take away the sun and rain
And everything I've ever owned
Let them have it all
Cos you give me something moreâ€¦
Oh Baby!
Cos there ain't nothing in this Universe
Can hold a candle next to you
And now my life's complete
Since you opened up the door
With a love worth dying for.
