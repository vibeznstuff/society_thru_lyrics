Think I can fly, think I can fly when I'm with U
My arms are wide, catching fire as the wind blows
I know that I'm rich enough for pride, 
I see a billion dollars in your eyes
Even if we’re strangers til we die

I wanna run away
I wanna run away
Anywhere out this place
I wanna run away
Just U and I, I, I, I, I
U and I, I, I, I, I 
U and I, I, I, I, I
U and I, I, I, I, I
Just U and I

I wanna run
Chase the morning sun when I'm with U
Give it all away
Catching fire as the wind blows
I know that I'm rich enough for pride, 
I see a billion dollars in your eyes
Even if we’re strangers til we die

I wanna run away
I wanna run away
Anywhere out this place
I wanna run away

Just U and I, I, I, I, I
U and I, I, I, I, I 
U and I, I, I, I, I
U and I, I, I, I, I
Just U and I
