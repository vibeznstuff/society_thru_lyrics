Love is but a song to sing
Feels the way we'll die
You can make the mountains ring
Or make the angels cry
Though the bird is on the wing
And you may know not why

Oh! Come on you people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
Come on you people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

Some may come and some may go
He will surely pass
When the one that let us heal
Returns for us at last
We are but in the morning sunlight
Fading in the grass

Oh! Come on you people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
Yes! Come on you people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

Come on you people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
