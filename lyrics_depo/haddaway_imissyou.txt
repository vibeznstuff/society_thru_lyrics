(I know if you could hear me you'd
Say there are always two sides of every story
Here's mine, I found out
I cannot live without you)

Loving you was easy,
And being true was hard,
One too many lies and you were gone
I didn't wanna face up to the things I've done
I thought I'd be alright but I was wrong

I miss you, oh I miss you
I'm gonna need you more and more each day
I miss you, more than words can say
More than words can ever say

Saying that I'm sorry isn't good enough
I need to show you just how much I've changed
'Cause girl if you could see what I'm going through
You wouldn't be afraid to try again

I miss you, oh I miss you
I'm gonna need you more and more each day
I miss you, more than words can say
More than words can ever say
