Lay your hands into my head
I've been rude
I don't care what you do

So much heart is not enough
I've seen few
Who treat me like you do

My foolish friend
Don't try to live my life
Upon this weary line

My foolish friend
Don't tell me if I'm right

Teenage tears the saving grace
Of this fool
But no one's watching you

Save this mirror for your face
Where there are two
No matter what you choose

My foolish friend
Don't try to live my life
Upon this weary line

My foolish friend
Don't tell me if I'm right
When my chameleon mouth
Is already studied

My foolish friend
Don't try to live my life
Upon this weary line

My foolish friend
Don't try to live my life
