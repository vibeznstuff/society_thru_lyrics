I don't like it when you break me honey
Why'd you have to do that?
Tell me when you'll make these tears keep falling
Do you feel like a man?

Figure, figure there's no working you out whatsoever
Only one way I can sum you up altogether
You got a black heart

Daddy I've fallen for a monster
Somehow he's scaring me to death
He's big and he's bad
I love him like mad
Momma, he's the best I ever had
Daddy I've fallen for a monster
He got a black heart

No walls to build around me honey
'Cause you blew my house down
Sticks and stones won't put it back up for me
And that's where we're at now

Sicker, sicker, I ain't feeling your mouth whatsoever
Naming hurts me more than weight thrown around but whatever
You got a black heart

Daddy I've fallen for a monster
Somehow he's scaring me to death
He's big and he's bad
I love him like mad
Momma, he's the best I ever had
Daddy I've fallen for a monster
He got a black heart

Daddy I've fallen for a monster
Somehow he's scaring me to death
He's big and he's bad
I love him like mad
Momma, he's the best I ever had
Daddy I've fallen for a monster
He got a black heart

He got a black heart
He got such a dirty black heart in him
Ain't it girls?! (yeah)
I love him like mad
Oh, yes I do
He got a black heart.
