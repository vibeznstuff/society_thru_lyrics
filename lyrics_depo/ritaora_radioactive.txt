Palms to the sky
We unite
I'm feeling, I'm feeling it, feel-feeling it
We rise tonight

(Hey, take a look at you)
(Hey, take a look at you)

I'm checking you out in your sweet desire
I'm coming over to make you mine
It's a crime, boy, you're so fine

I'm taking you out, boy, it's a green light
I'm glad you came over, it was about time
It feels right, boy, you're so fine

This goes radioactive
Drop the ball, let me feel the beat
This goes radioactive
Drop the ball, let me feel the beat

Palms to the sky
You know,
I'm feeling, I'm feeling it, feel-feeling it
We rise tonight

Palms to the sky
We unite,
I'm feeling, I'm feeling it, feel-feeling it
We rise tonight

Moving on me as the world ends
This nuclear heat is a beautiful air
You might not live to tell

This goes radioactive
Drop the ball, let me feel the beat
This goes radioactive
Drop the ball, let me feel the beat

Palms to the sky
You know,
I'm feeling, I'm feeling it, feel-feeling it
We rise tonight

Palms to the sky
We unite,
I'm feeling, I'm feeling it, feel-feeling it
We rise tonight

(Hey, take a look at you)

Palms to the sky
You and I
Palms to the sky
You and I
Palms to the sky
You and I
We rise tonight

Palms to the sky
You know,
I'm feeling, I'm feeling it, feel-feeling it
We rise tonight

Palms to the sky
We unite,
I'm feeling, I'm feeling it, feel-feeling it
We rise tonight

We unite,
You and I are right tonight
We unite,
You and I are right tonight
We unite,
You and I are right tonight
You and I are right tonight
