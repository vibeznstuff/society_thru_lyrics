The sweetest girl in all the world
These eyes are for you only
The sweetest girl in all the world
These eyes are for you only
The sweetest girl in all the world
These words that die before me
The sweetest girl in all the world
These words that die before me

When we walk in the park
I never can tell
When we walk in the dark
I never can tell
It's just loving it
Ooooo loving it

The sweetest boy in all the world
His life has got so lonely
The sweetest boy in all the world
His life has got so lonely
The maddest group in all the world
How could they do this to me
The maddest group in all the world
How could they do this to me

What I want I shall take
What you think that you know
Oooo such an awful mistake
To never let go

When the government falls
I wish I could tell
When necessity calls
I never can tell

The weakest link in any chain
I always want to find them
The strongest words in each belief
Find out what's behind them
Politics is prior to the vagaries of science
She left because she understood
The value of defiance

The sweetest girl in all the world
These eyes are for you only
The sweetest boy in all the world
His life has got so lonely
The sweetest girl in all the world
These words that die before you
She wants to go but she don't know why
Loving it oooo loving it
The maddest group in all the world
How could they do this to me
The sweetest boy in all the world
His life has got so lonely
The sweetest girl in all the world
These words that die before you
The sweetest boy in all the world
His life has got so lonely
