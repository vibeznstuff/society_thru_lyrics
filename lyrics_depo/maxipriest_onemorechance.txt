Uh oh yeah
There's no reason for hurting baby
You know I'm on your side
'Cause I've been sitting here thinking about us baby
And I wanna make it right oh yeah

Though I know I really stepped out a line before
Time after time
And you just got to believe in my promises baby
Even though that's the last thing on your mind oh yeah

I know I realize all the things I've done wrong
We must find a way to make our love grow strong

One more chance is all I ask, one more chance
Just one more chance
Got to believe in my promises baby
One more try is all I ask, one more chance
Just one more try hey hey hey

Uh oh

Won't you please just reconsider baby
Forget all the things I said and done
For all it takes is just a little understanding
Think of love and we'll make it right hey

I feel my life changing
You changed me for the better
Within my heart I know what's right
We should be together

One more chance is all I ask
Just one more chance
Got to believe in my promises baby

One more try is all I ask, one more chance
Just one more try hey hey hey uh oh
I wanna do you right

One more try one more try baby
I wanna do you right

I should've known better than to cause you pain oh~
To let you down and turn away
Let me do you right

Won't you give me one more try, won't you give me a one more try baby
I wanna make it right, one more try
I realized I know I was wrong all the things I said and done
One more chance baby that's all I ask that's all I ask
I wanna do you right

One more one more one more one more one more try
Let me do you right

I should've known better than to cause you pain oh~
To let you down and turn away
One more chance oh baby
It's all I ask I gotta make you mine
One more chance

One more one more one more one more one more try
Let me do you right
