We've been deceived for so long, we stop believe
Can't tell what's right or what's wrong
So you stop feelin'
When violence, and coercion. Are their tools
Then you must stand scream

No. Hell no. Won't follow commands I won't meet
Your demands said
No. Hell no. I am not yours to rule I won't be
Your fool cause

We are standing here waiting you'll listen to reason
This is a war you cannot win
We are standing here waiting. And you're gonna listen
This is a war you cannot win.

I now can see that it's all a fight for power.
But there is no way we are wrong this is our hour
One voice can silence the masses
One voice just scream these words say

No. Hell no. Won't follow commands I won't meet
Your demands said
No. Hell no. I am not yours to rule I won't be
Your fool cause

We are standing here waiting you'll listen to reason
This is a war you cannot win
We are standing here waiting. And you're gonna listen
This is a war you cannot win.

Just take a good look around you now
You have to see there's no way
You can't control what we feel, what we think,
And we will not go away.

No. Hell no. Won't follow commands I won't meet
Your demands said
No. Hell no. I am not yours to rule I won't be
Your fool cause

We are standing here waiting you'll listen to reason
This is a war you cannot win
We are standing here waiting. And you're gonna listen
This is a war you cannot win.

Won't follow commands won't meet your demands
(War you cannot win)
We are standing here waiting
Won't follow commands won't meet your demands
(This is a war you cannot win)
