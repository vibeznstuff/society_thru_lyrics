Nine times out of ten, baby, I told you
And I ain't gonna tell you just nine times again
Aah, just how much I aim to hold you
Again and again and again

Little girl, it's nine times out of ten, you've refused me
And then say that you refuse me nine times again
But I won't stop until you choose me
Again and again and again

(Well,) don't try to fight it
'Cause it's no use
You're gonna find that
I'm stubborn as a doggone mule

Nine times out of ten I've tried to kiss you
And I ain't trying just nine times again
Well, if I missed the nine times that I've tried, baby
I'll bet my life, I'll get you on number ten

Well, don't try to fight it
Come, baby, it ain't no use
You're gonna find that
I'm stubborn as a doggone mule

Nine times out of ten I've tried to kiss you
And I ain't trying just nine times again
Well, if I missed the nine times that I've tried, baby
I'll bet my life, I'll get you on number ten
