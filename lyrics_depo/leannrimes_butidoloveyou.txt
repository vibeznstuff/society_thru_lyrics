I don't like to be alone in the night
And I don't like to hear I'm wrong when I'm right 
And I don't like to have the rain on my shoes 
But I do love you 
But I do love you 

I don't like to see the sky painted grey 
And I don't like when, nothin's goin my way 
And I don't like to be the one with the blues 
But I do love you 
But I do love you 

I love everything about the way your lovin me 
The way you lay your head upon my shoulder when you sleep 
And I love to kiss you in the rain 
I love everything you do, oh I do-o 

And I don't like to turn the radio on 
Just to find I missed my favorite song 
And I don't like to be the last with the news 
But I do love you 
But I do love you 

I love everything about the way your lovin me 
The way you lay your head upon my shoulder when you sleep 
And I love to kiss you in the rain 
I love everything you do, oh I do 

And I don't like to be alone in the night 
And I don't like to hear I'm wrong when I'm right 
And I don't like to have the rain on my shoes 
But I do love you 
But I do love you 
But I do love you
But I do love you
