Oh...
Hey Hey Hey Hey...
I want you 

Hey, I love the night life
Yes I do it's so much fun
And before you know it
Ah here comes the sun
Sweetheart it's been real, but...
The thrill is gone

Silence is like a spirit
That picked my house to haunt
But I know it's there so I'm nonchalant
Now the question is just what do I want


And I want you to run away with me and experience something new
Anything you've already done just won't do
I want you
And I want you to genuinely and sincerely want me too
You can believe in my baby
Don't be cruel
'Cause I want you

Would a trip to a remote island ease your mind
Oh you look like a solitaire in the sunshine
I like her 'cause she's fun
She's fearless
She's a friend of mine

Oh I'm not trying to say that you need any help
You can have anything you want with your bad self
I like her 'cause she's smart
But she's still sexy
She is somethin' else


That's why I want you to run away with me and experience something new
Anything you've already done just won't do
I want you
And I want you to genuinely and sincerely want me too
You can believe in my baby, don't be cruel
'Cause I want you

Oh...
Oh one rarely finds a lady
That happens to be three times the lady
God is good
But he took his time when he designed you baby
That's why I want you

And
Oh I'll even quit my job
Lovin' you, I'll make it my job
Thank you Lord, thank you lord
This is it
My god!
That's why I want you
