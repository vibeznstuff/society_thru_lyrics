If I could learn to love you
Could you learn to love me
Lust will only get us so far now

Lust, top 40 fame...
I can smell your catholic shame
But it goes on &amp; on..

The fashion police keep chasing
The Irish keep gate-crashing
Lust will only get us so far now

I finally shed my puppy fat
No, kids, there's no encore tonight
But it goes on &amp; on..
