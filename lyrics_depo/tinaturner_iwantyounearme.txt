SHOULD YOU STAY SHOULD YOU GO
HMM YOU'RE BEGINNING TO SEE
I BLOW HOT I BLOW COLD
OO IT'S JUST THE DEVIL IN ME
YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND I AM
IN LOVE WITH A BEAUTIFUL MAN
SO IF YOU'RE FEELING INSECURE
YOU'VE REALLY GOT NO CAUSE TO BE

DON'T TURN AWAY
JUST GOT USED TO HAVING YOU AROUND
I WANT YOU NEAR ME
COME ON HERE AND STAY
DON'T LET ME DOWN

TO HELP ME WITH A HOOK OR ZIP
INDISPENSABLE THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE
HMM FOR THE OCCASIONAL KISS
I'M ONLY PLAYING GAMES WITH YOU
I CAN'T BE NICE WITHOUT BEING CRUEL
I KNOW IT'S UNFAIR BUT I MAKE THE RULES

JUST GOT USED TO HAVING YOU AROUND
I WANT YOU NEAR ME
COME ON HERE AND STAY
DON'T LET ME DOWN

IS YOUR ATTENTION
UNDIVIDED

I WANT YOU NEAR ME
COME ON HERE AND STAY
DON'T LET ME DOWN
