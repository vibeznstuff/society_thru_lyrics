you've done it all, you've broken every code
and pulled the rebel to the floor
you spoilt the game, no matter what you say
for only metal - what a bore!

blue eyes, blue eyes
how come you tell so many lies?

come up and see me, make me smile
or do what you want, running wild

there's nothing left, all gone and run away
maybe you'll tarry for a while
it's just a test, a game for us to play
win or lose, it's hard to smile

resist, resist
it's from yourself you have to hide

come up and see me, make me smile
or do what you want, running wild

there ain't no more, you've taken everything
from my belief in Mother Earth
can you ignore my faith in everything
'cause i know what faith is and what it's worth

away, away
and don't say maybe you'll try

to come up and see me, make me smile
or do what you want, running wild
