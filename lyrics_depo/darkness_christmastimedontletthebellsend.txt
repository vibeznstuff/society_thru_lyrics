Feinging joy and surprise at the gifts we despise over mulled wine with you
On the 25th day of the 12th month
The sleigh bells are in time ringing true
How we cling each Noel to that snowflake's hope in hell
that it won’t end

Don’t let the bells end
Christmas time, just let them ring in peace.

Well the weather is cruel,
and the season of Yule warms the heart, but it still hurts.
You’ve got your career, spent the best part of last year apart and it still hurts
So that’s why I pray each and every Christmas day that it won’t end

Don’t let the bells end
Christmas time, just let them ring in peace.

Christmas time, don’t let the bells end
Christmas time, don’t let the bells end

Dust underneath the mistletoe leaves when you’re not here,
You went away upon boxing day,
Now how the hell am I gonna make it into the New Year.

Christmas time, don’t let the bells end
Christmas time, don’t let the bells end

Christmas time, don’t let the bells end
Christmas time, just let them ring in peace.

Christmas time, don’t let the bells end
Christmas time, don’t let the bells end
