It's time to take you to its full potential
Peep this
and drop some game on the instrumental  and
it's essenial that you listen close and better tell your folks
that the loc has spoke
first things first since your date of birth
you've been kinda confused about what your life is worth
50 million times your weight in gold
you gotta take control
cause fools don't live to be old
you can do anything that you want to do
all you got to do is to put your brain into it
take your time and educate your mind and
in the long run I'm sure you'll find that
if you walk the walk you can talk the talk
but don't wait too long cuz life is short
and remember, no matter what they tellin' you
if you try, you can be a winner too


Keep on pushing 
moving on up
everybody we're moving on up
moving on up
you're a winner
you gotta keep pushing
moving on up
everybody we're moving on up
moving on up
you're a winner


Everybody rise men and women boys and girls
each one teach one but we can't save the world
all at one day you got to take it play by play
and once you're on the path
don't you ever go a stray
you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink
you can give a man some wizdom but you can't make him man feel
cuz 
stich in time saves nine
early bird gets the worm
but all you can think about is gettin attention for your perm
if knowledge is power and power is knowledge, then 
how so many idiots be graduating from colleges
better the B-side than the be gotted fool
than to speakin to move all out
you know what I'm talking about
when opportunity knocks you better let him in and sit him on down
and try to be his friend
in order to be a professional first you got to be a beginner
but if you keep on pushing you can be a winner




Red yellow black white or brown
if every mind their business we can all get down
it all starts and on
coz once they're grown they're gone
and once they're on their own their own
you got to leave them alone
be a leader but if you can't be a leader 
make sure your leader is a damn good teacher and
imagine if you was in a car and your life was wasted
somebody was on your back and you had to give him some space
put the petal to the metal and match at low
but make sure you stay in your lane 
and go strof to strof
we don't need no penaltys or eliminations
or disqualifications 
what we need is penetrations
now what you heard before but sometimes life is what you make it
I ain't the one thats known for fakin or perpetratin
if Albert was an Einstein
and Phillis was a Diller
and Michael Jackson was a thriller
then you could be a winner
