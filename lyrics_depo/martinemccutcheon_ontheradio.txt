Ooh,
Ah, yeah 
Someone found a letter you wrote me
On the radio
And they told the world
Just how you felt
It must have fallen out
Of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name
But I knew just who they meant 

Woah
Oh, I was so surprised and shocked
And I wondered too
If by chance you'd
Heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I've
Been feeling over you
But they said it really loud
They said it on the air 

On the radio
Woah
On the radio
Woah
On the radio
Woah
On the radio
Woah 

Now, now
Don't it kind of strike you sad
When you hear our song
Things were not the same since
We broke up last June
The only thing that I wanted to hear
Is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be coming
Home real soon
Woah 

Oh yeah it kinda made me feel proud
When I heard you say
(Ooh)
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself
(No, no, no, no, no)
And now in my heart I know I can say
What I really feel
'Cos they said it really loud
They said it on the air 

On the radio
Woah
On the radio
Woah
On the radio
Woah
On the radio
Woah 

If you think that love isn't found
On the radio
Then tune right in, you made find the love you lost
(Ooh woah)
'Cos now I'm sitting here
With the man I sent away long ago
He finally realised
He said it really loud 

On the radio
Woah
On the radio
Woah
On the radio
Woah
On the radio
Woah 

On the radio
Woah
On the radio
Woah
On the radio
Woah
On the radio
Woah
