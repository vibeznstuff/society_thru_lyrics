You packed your things in a carpet bag
Left home never looking back
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes
Music wherever you go
You don't fit in a small town world
But I feel you are the girl for me
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes
You're leavin' town where nobody knows

You can win if you want
If you want it you will win
On your way you will see
That life is more than fantasy
Take my hand follow me
Oh you gotta brand-new friend
For your life

You can win if you want
If you want it you will win
Oh, come on take a chance
For a brand-new wild romance
Take my hand for the night
And your feelings will be right
Hold me tight

Oh darkness finds you on your own
Endless highways keep on rollin' on
You are miles and miles from your home
But you never want to phone your home
A steady job and a nice young man
Your parents set your future plan
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes
That's the way your story goes
