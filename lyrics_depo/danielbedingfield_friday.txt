I live in an Ice house a 
I never do dance salsa
I'm living in Jamaca
I live in an Ice Breaker
I'm living in Africa
I never do Know where a
Where I'm living but I'm living in a free fall
Whenever she goes away
Might as well be in San Jose
'Cause I never can tell where my
Where my heart's gonna spend it's time
Half of me's missing
I miss her Kissing
I don't know nothing but I know 

She's coming back on Friday 
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday

My head is a hurricane
My heart is a touch insane
and my body can't sleep to dream
And my Eyes open up to scream
And my mouth is a thin straight line
As I'm struggling to pass the time
And my crime is that I'm living life without her
And the morning soon will come
And the days nearly almost done
And the clock says it's half past five
But the sun is still in the sky

Disorientated
Insatiated
How long I've waited but I know 

She's coming back on Friday 
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
