Bubba

Shit I ain't choose to rhyme
Rhymin' chose me
So I hit the track runnin'
Like a nosebleed
Life ain't great now
But it's much improved
Yo' album droppin' this summer?
That sucks for you
''Cause this is Bubba's moment
I put my mother on it
I said my momma
It seems as if
I love her don't it?
So buckle up, 'cause
It's gon' get bumpy
I call my girlfriends Betty's
And my sh*ts grumpies
That Bubba talk
Gotcha open wide
I giggle outside the booth
But ain't no joke inside
This is complicated
At least to y'all it is
Just let me sell fifty million
Then I'll call it quits
But until that day
Y'all in deep doo doo
I never once saw
You crank it 'cause
I just leap through you
What you need to do
Is just admit you love me
The South has
Always been Dirty
But now it's gettin' ugly


Ugly-in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get
Ugly, ugly, ugly
In here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
Uh-oh

Though I am country
Don't get the wrong idea
My ego's gettin' bigger
With every song I hear
'Cause y'all been bullsh*ttin'
Spittin' that booty chatter
Out here for two days and
Came with somethin'
That truly matters
On goes the saga
Of Bubba's plight
She won't see tomorrah
If I don't cut tonight
That's just my mood now
I hate it came to this
How else can I say it
I don't speak
No other languages
I'm fairly ripped now
So this the jimmy talkin'
You hear that beat don'tcha?
That's just Timmy talkin'
Go 'head throw dem bows
F*** it, break a bottle
Let's be honest none of us
Will ever date a model
So let's just cut it loose
Ignore the repercussions
If you scared, then just
Forget what we discussin'
This that new South
Take a picture of me
'Cause I'm a f***in' legend
And this is gettin' ugly



Now this thang is jumpin'
Ain't it somethin'?
What makes it special
This whole moment
Came from nothin'
Now you see it triples
I bet she slurp tonight
Lames hide your wallets
Hatin' broads
Clutch your purses tight
If you ain't tryin' to live
You with the wrong crowd
And if you feelin' brave then
Better sport that thong proud
And if you finally breathin'
Then sing this song loud
I'm glad I got you wet
I know you had a long drought
Don't worry about the law
They can't arrest us all
I had to crank couldn'ta done
Nothin' less for y'all
Forget your inhibitions
I wanna see you whylin'
And if Bubba dies tonight
Know he was smilin'




Ha ha, it's gon' get
(Ugly-in here)
Thck, thck
(Huh, in here
Huh, in here)
It's gon' get
(Ugly-in here)
(Huh, in here
Huh, in here)
It's gon' get (ugly)
Say what?
(Ugly, ugly)
Say what?
(Ugly) In here
Huh, in here
(It's gon' get ugly in here)
(Huh, in here
Huh, in here
Uh-oh)
Thcka, thcka, thcka, thcka
Thcka, check switch uh

Switch it one time
Now switch it back baby
Switch it one time
Now switch it back baby

"Holla ain't no stoppin' me
Copywritten so"
(So what?)
"Don't copy me"

I want you to

"Holla ain't no stoppin' me
Copywritten so, don't copy me"

C'mon Bubba, let's go
