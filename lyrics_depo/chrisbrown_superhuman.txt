Weak
I have been crying and crying for weeks
How'd I survive when I can barely speak
Barely eat
On my knees


But that's the moment you came to me
I don't know what your love has done to me
Think I'm invincible I see
Through the me
I used to be



You changed my whole life

Don't know what you're doing to me with your love

I'm feeling all Super human
You did that to me
Superhuman heart beats in me

Nothing can stop me here with you, super human
Super human

Super human

Super human


Strong
Since I've been flying and righting the wrongs
Feels almost like I had it all along
I can see tomorrow

But every problem is gone because
I flew everywhere with love inside of me
It's unbelievable to see
How love could set me free



You changed my whole life
Don't know what you're doing to me with your love
I'm feeling all super human
You did that to me
Superhuman heart beats in me
Nothing can stop me here with you, super human
Super human

Super human


It's not a bird
Not a plane


It's my heart and it's gonna go away


My only weakness is you
Only reason is you
Every minute with you I feel like I can do
Anything



Going going I'm going away
In love
You changed my whole life
Don't know what you're doing to me with your love
I'm feeling all super human
You did that to me
Superhuman heart beats in me
Nothing can stop me here with you, super human
Super human

Super human
