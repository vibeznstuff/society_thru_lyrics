The circle of the moon
The rising of the sun
We'll be together soon
Our story's just begun
Time will bring us near
I'll never be too far
Oh, baby, don't you fear
I'll always be where you are

You can dry my tears
But you can't stop the pain inside
I'm trying to hide
As I hold you near
I know I have to pull away
You know that I can't stay
All of my life
No one has touched me the way that you do
Wherever I go
I know that the road will lead back to you


So don't say goodbye
Don't turn away
It doesn't have to end today
Don't say goodbye
'Cause I will love you 'til the end of time

Don't say goodbye

Can you feel my love inside
The way that my body's sighing
With your every breath
I try to memorize
Every move you're making
So I'll never forget
The way that you feel
Whenever your heart is beating with mine
Wherever I go
I'll keep my memories of you inside



Don't say goodbye
We'll never be apart
We'll see the same stars
Just close your eyes
And I'll be where you are

Don't say goodbye
'Cause if you say that word
My heart won't survive



Don't say goodbye

The circle of the moon
The rising of the sun
We'll be together soon
Our story's just begun
Time will bring us near
I'll never be too far
Oh, baby, don't you fear
I'll always be where you are
