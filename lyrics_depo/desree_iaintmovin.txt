Love is my passion, love is my friend
Love's universal, love never ends
Then why am I faced with so much anger, so my pain?
Why should I hide? Why should I be ashamed?

Time's much too short to be livin', somebody else's life
I walk with dignity, I step with pride

'Cause I ain't moving from my face, from my race, from my history
I ain't movin' from my love, my peaceful dove, means too much to me
And loving self can be so hard, honesty can be demanding
Learn to love yourself it's a great, great feeling

When you're down baby, I will set you free
I will be your remedy, I will be your tree
A wise man is clever, seldom ever speaks a word
A foolish man keeps talking, never is he heard, no no no no

Time's much too short to be livin', somebody else's life
I walk with dignity, I step with pride

'Cause I ain't moving from my face, from my race, from my history
I ain't movin' from my love, my peaceful dove, means too much to me
And loving self can be so hard, honesty can be demanding
Learn to love yourself it's a great, great feeling

Time's too lonely, too lonely without words
Future voices need to be heard
Eyebrows are always older than the beards
Momma said be brave, you've nothing to fear and I, ooh

Time's much too short to be livin', somebody else's life
I walk with dignity, I step with pride

'Cause I ain't moving from my face, from my race, from my history
I ain't movin' from my love, my peaceful dove, means too much to me
And loving self can be so hard, honesty can be demanding
Learn to love yourself it's a great, great feeling

'Cause I ain't moving from my face, from my race, from my history
I ain't movin' from my love, my peaceful dove, means too much to me
And loving self can be so hard, honesty can be demanding
If we learn to love ourself we'll have great, great feeling

'Cause I ain't movin', I've been here long before
I ain't movin' 'cause I want more
I ain't movin', got my feet on the ground, hey
As far as I'm concerned, love should win the rounds, oh yeah
