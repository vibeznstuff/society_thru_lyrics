Always had a roof above me
Always paid the rent
I never, set foot inside a tent
Couldn’t build a fire to save my life
I lied about being, the outdoor type

I’ve never slept out underneath the stars
Closest that I came to that was one time my car,
Broke down for an hour
In the suburbs, at night
I lied about being, the outdoor type

Too scared to let you know
I knew what you were looking for
Lied until I’d fit the bill
God bless the great indoors
I lied about being, the outdoor type
I’ve never owned a sleeping bag, let alone a mountain bike

I can’t go away with you on a rocking climbing weekend
What if something’s on TV and it’s never shown again
Just as well I’m not invited
I’m afraid of heights
I lied about being, the outdoor type

Never learned to swim
Can’t grow a beard or even fight
I lied about being, the outdoor type
