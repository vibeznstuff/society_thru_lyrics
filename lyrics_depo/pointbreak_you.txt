You said I don't know who you are
Trying to reach you so near yet so far
You said I was falling apart
How did you notice from this hole in your heart


I dreamed every second through of every passing day
These dreams were reality
How was I to know that they'd fly away


You
You stole the sun from my day
You always have your own say
You drifted away
You

Waiting for the moment to come
I'm lost in this maze that I've stumbled upon
Dreaming of the beautiful end
These wounds don't heal easy
But I'm trying to mend


Won't walk any further, baby
You're gonna watch me run
Been living in this fairytale
For far too long look what we've become





You
You stole the moon from my night
I always thought I was right
You stole all my night
You
