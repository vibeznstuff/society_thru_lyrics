You want love
You get hate
Yeah, you push and shove
You know you just can't wait
You've had your fun
You don't fool no one

You build it up
To tear it down
You're running out of luck
I won't get kicked around
I could drive all night
Till you're out of sight

Hide and seek
Turning on the heat
Running like a cadillac (like a cadillac)
I'm so sick and tired
You're a damn dirty liar
When I run, I said I ain't coming back

Oh, you better beware
Keep on rocking this house, baby, I don't care
Breaking out this jailhouse, going nowhere
I ain't ready for no rocking chair

When you came
You play rough
Now I know your game
And you ain't tough enough
Don't know what you've done
'Cause you ain't begun

You fool with me
You're going to lose
You've got to understand
That you don't get to choose
When night comes around
I can't be found

Hide and seek
Turning on the heat
Running like a cadillac (like a cadillac)
I'm so sick and tired
You're a damn dirty liar
When I run, I said I ain't coming back

Oh, you better beware
Keep on rocking this house, baby, I don't care
Breaking out this jailhouse, going nowhere
I ain't ready for no rocking chair

Red sky burning
Won't be no returning
So long
Fire up the motor
Don't you get no closer
Yeah, I'm gone

Oh, you better beware
Keep on rocking this house, baby, I don't care
Breaking out this jailhouse, going nowhere
I ain't ready for no rocking chair

I need my rocking, but I don't need no rocking chair
I don't need no rocking chair
I don't want no rocking chair
I don't need no rocking chair
I said I don't want no rocking chair
No, no, no
No, no, no
