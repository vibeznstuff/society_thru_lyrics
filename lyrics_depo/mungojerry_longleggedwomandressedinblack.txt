She's a long-legged woman dressed in black, 
Dressed in black, dressed in black, 
Dressed in black, black, black
She's a long-legged woman dressed in black, 
Dressed in black, dressed in black, 
Dressed in black, black, black

Every time I make a move, she tells me no
Every time I make a move, she tells me no
Every time I make a move, she tells me no
Every time I make a move, she tells me no

Yeah, she knows how to move, how to rock
How to rock, how to rock, how to rock, rock, rock
Yeah, she knows how to move, how to rock
How to rock, how to rock, how to rock, rock, rock

Every time I make a move, she tells me no
Every time I make a move, she tells me no
Every time I make a move, she tells me no
Every time I make a move, she tells me no

And she's stoned like a flash in the night
In the night, in the night, in the n-, ni-, night
And she's stoned like a flash in the night
In the night, in the night, in the n-, ni-, night

Every time I make a move, she tell me no
Every time I make a move, she tell me no
Every time I make a move, she tell me no
Every time, every time, every time, every time, every time, every time
Whoa!

She's a long-legged woman dressed in black, 
Dressed in black, dressed in black, 
Dressed in black, black, black
She's a long-legged woman dressed in black, 
Dressed in black, dressed in black, 
Dressed in black, black, black

Every time I make a move, she tell me no
Every time I make a move, she tell me no
Every time I make a move, she tell me no...
