I'll be true to you yes I will
I'll be true to you yes I will
I won't look twice when the other girls go by
I'll be true to you yes I will

Somehow this time it's all so clear to me
The way to go is easy to see
My heart is sure you're the girl I've waited for
I'll be true to you yes I will

Yes I will
I used to be the kind
Who said that every girl's the same
And love was just a game for havin' fun
But when I looked at you
I knew that I was wrong
And that I really could belong to only one

I'll be true to you yes I will
Every dream that you have I'll fulfil
I never promised this to any girl before
But I'll be true to you yes I will



I never promised this to any girl before
But I'll be true to you yes I will

Yes I will
Yes I will
Yes I will
Oh, yes I will
