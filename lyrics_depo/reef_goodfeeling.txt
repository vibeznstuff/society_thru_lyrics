Got this good feeling in me,
Everything's feeling clear inside,
Look around, that glow is real,
Silence felt so good,
Inside it lay so calm, mm mm, yeah girl, mm.
Wind that blew some cold;
Mm but now it feels a world away.
Not to try and just to be,
Someone truly special like you always were, mm mm, yeah girl.

And well your time will come to work things out.
Yeah, your time will come to work things out.
Your time will come to work things out, when it flows.

A passion came to me,
Warmth around, just like you found someone, mm mm, yeah girl, mm.
Alongside it walked with me,
Showed me to be grateful, for the way I am, mm mm, yeah girl, mm.
Came from deep inside,
Thoughts so real, just as the ground you're on, yeah.
Why do you want to try to be?
Look to yourself, I think you'll find someone, mm mm, yeah girl.

And well your time will come to work things out.
Yeah, well your time will come to work things out.
Yeah, well your time will come to work things out, let it flow.

It feels so close to me.
It feels so close to me.
It feels so close to me.
It feels...
It feels...
It feels...
It feels...

And well your time will come to work things out, hey.
Yeah, well your time will come to work things out, yeah.
Oh, well your time will come to work things out, let it flow.
You don't say, I don't know, what you do, when I play.

Oh, it feels so close to me.
Oh, god, it feels so close to me.
Oh, it feels so close to me.
Let me hear you when I'm saying:
It feels so close to me.
Understand me when I'm saying:
It feels so close to me.
Oh, it, feels so close, to me.
