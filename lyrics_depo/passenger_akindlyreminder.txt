Well I heard all about your travel ban
Just for countries that don't fit your business plan
But how can you decide who cannot and who can
You're the president now, not a business man

And I heard you say climate change isn't real
But that's not how the world's leading scientists feel
So go bury your head in the sand if you will
But the waters are rising around Capitol Hill

With four years in front and only three weeks behind you
You've somehow already managed to upset China
And if I could offer a kindly reminder
It's not okay to grab women by the vagina

And maybe it's cause your hands are so small
That's why you have to build such a big fucking wall
Yeah you promised it wide and you promised it tall
Now you're wanting the Mexicans to pay for it all

And you say that you'll make America great
But I fear that we're in for a long fucking wait
Cause your carving divides through every state
And you're filling up hearts with fear and hate

And I know this song won't change your thoughts
We're more likely to see your tax reports
