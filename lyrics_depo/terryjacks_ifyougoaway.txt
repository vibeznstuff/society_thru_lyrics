If you go away
On this summer day
Then you might as well
Take the sun away
All the birds that flew 
In the summer sky
When our love was new
And our hearts were high
And the day was young
And the nights were long
And the moon stood still 
For the night bird's song
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away

But if you stay
I'll make you a day
Like no day has been
Or will be again
We'll sail the sun
We'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees
We'll fly with the wind

But if you go away
When I love you so
There'll be nothing left
In the world, you know
Just an empty room
Full of empty space
Like the empty look
I see on your face
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away

But if you stay
I'll make you a day
Like no day has been
Or will be again
We'll sail the sun
We'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees
We'll fly with the wind

But if you go away
If you go away
If you go away
