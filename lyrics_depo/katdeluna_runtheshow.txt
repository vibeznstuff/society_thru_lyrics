Saka De man
GMB, first lady, Kat
Yo dun' know
Red One, let's go


Got you half flippin like fire
Come with me let me take you higher
I'm the object of all your desire
And your attention is all i require
Don't stop now
Cause you on a roll
Make me go anywhere that you go
I'm that dream in your head when you're sleepin'
I'm that secret inside that you're keepin' woah-woah


You want this don't front qué qué qué pasa
Speak up cuál es la cosa
Ven aquí let's get closer and closer


I say no-oh-oh
If you wanna take it slow-oh-oh
Catch up well now let's go-oh-oh
Together we run the show-oh-oh

I say no-oh-oh
If you wanna take it slow-oh-oh
Don't stop well now let's go-oh-oh
Together we run the show-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Bite your lips cause you know that you feel it
When i shake it you know you're addicted
I see you're lovin this dominicana
You like the way that I dance the bachata

Don't stop now, cause i'm on a roll
Give you that gutta you feel in your soul
My heart beats like a drum can you hear it


I know you want this don't front qué qué qué pasa
Speak up cuál es la cosa
Ven aquí let's get closer and closer




Yeah
ShakaDee
Black kat
Red one
Let's go

Me takin it slow, me takin it fast
Me like a train baby girl when me take in the pants
Me and you what i think that's what the aftermath
And after that me and you could just slip the cash
The pon and kat just smashin the party
After that, yo kat, let's mash up the lobby
Cause this is a dance and this is a hobby
It's fire in here and GMB got me
WOAH
