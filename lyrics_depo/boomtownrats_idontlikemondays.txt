The silicon chip inside her head
Gets switched to overload
And nobody's gonna go to school today
She's going to make them stay at home

And daddy doesn't understand it
He always said she was as good as gold
And he can see no reason 'cause there are no reasons
What reason do you need to be shown?

(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays
(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays
(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays
I wanna shoot

The whole day down

The telex machine is kept so clean
And it types to a waiting world
Her mother feels so shocked, father's world is rocked
And their thoughts turn to their own little girl

Sweet 16 ain't that peachy keen
No, it ain't so neat to admit defeat
They can see no reasons 'cause there are no reasons
What reason do you need, oh, ohoho

(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays
(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays
(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays
I wanna shoot

The whole day down, down, down
Shoot it all down

And all the playing's stopped in the playground now
She wants to play with the toys a while
And school's out early and soon we be learning
And the lesson today is how to die

And then the bullhorn crackles and the captain tackles
With the problems and the hows and whys
And he can see no reasons 'cause there are no reasons
What reason do you need to die, die, ohoho

And the silicon chip inside her head
Gets switched to overload, oh
And nobody's gonna go to school today
She's going to make them stay at home

And daddy doesn't understand it
He always said she was as good as gold
And he can see no reason 'cause there are no reasons
What reason do you need to be shown?

(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays
(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays
(Tell me why) I don't like, I don't like
(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays

Tell me why I don't like, I don't like
(Tell me why) I don't like Mondays
Tell me why I don't like Mondays
I wanna shoot

The whole day down
(Ooohooohooo, ooohooohooo
Ooohooohooo)
