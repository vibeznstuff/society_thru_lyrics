When was the last time I said
I love you
I find it hard to say
But I do

When was the last time I said
I need you
I've kept it to myself
Much too long
(It's been too long, it's been too long)

In all my life
I've never known anyone like you
I love you, I love you
Only you

I've been in love before
I didn't think I could love anymore
But there you were with love
In your heart for me

I can feel it when we kiss
I can tell when we touch
That the magic of love
Was meant for you and me
(For you and me, for you and me)

In all my life
I've never had a love so true
I love you, I love you
Only you (Only you)

I know it when we touch

Oh, I know if I had the power
To make this song come true
It would be for me
To build my life with only you
