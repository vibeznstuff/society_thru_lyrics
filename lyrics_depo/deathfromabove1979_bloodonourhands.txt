I'm leaving while you turn away
In the basement is where I'm gonna stay
There is blood in all the things I say
Will you hate me if I stay this way

From the bedroom where we're running from
There's a sequel to the things I've done
You're a woman we both know it's true
By the things that I've done to you

There is blood on all the shoes you've worn
From the people you've been stepping on
There is blood in all the things you say
I won't hate you if you go away

There is blood on our hands again
From the bedroom is where we will
bring it back to the start again
bring it back to the love we had

There is blood on our hands again
From the bedroom is where will
Bring it back to the love we had
Bring it back to...

I'm leaving while you turn away

bring it back to the start again
bring it back to the love we had

There is blood on our hands again

Bring it back to the love we had
Bring it back to...
