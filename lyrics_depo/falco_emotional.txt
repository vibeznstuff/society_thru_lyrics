Ooh yeah yeah yeah
Here comes the soul
Gimme that soul
Ooh he's emotional
He's an emotional man
Sacrify the day
And bless the night
Want you to come and do me
Ooh he's emotional
He's an emotional man
He's got tears in his eyes
Watch him break down and cry
Watch me cry
Hear me babe 

Was soll ich Dir noch sagen
Es ist doch alles schon gesagt
Ohne uns sind wir die Hälfte wert
Wir geh'n vorbei und seh'n es nicht 

He's a desperate man in a world so cold
Und du weißt, ich habe ein Herz wie ein Löwe
He's just longing for a woman to hold
Und das Herz geht so lange zum Messer bis es sticht
Do me 

Ooh he's emotional
He's an emotional man
So emotional
I had my woman right here
I had her in the palm of my hand
Want you to come and do me
Ooh he's emotional
So emotional
He's an emotional man
He's got tears in his eyes
Watch him break down and cry
Watch me cry 

Still hear me babe
Ich weiß die Frau die mich erträgt 
Noch nicht geboren ist
Aber ich bitte Dich, komm' zur Welt 

He's a desperate man in a world so cold
Und du weißt, ich habe ein Herz wie ein Löwe
He's just longing for a woman to hold
Und wenn Du willst, 
Dann geh' ich down on my knees 
And pray to the spirits above, do me 

Ooh he's emotional
So emotional
He's an emotional man
I had my woman right here
I had her in the palm of my hand
Want you to come and do me
Ooh he's emotional
So emotional
He's an emotional man
He's got tears in his eyes
Watch him break down and cry
Cry -
Watch me break down and cry
Tears in my eyes I've got to cry cry
Tears in my eyes I've got to cry cry
Watch me break down and cry
And pray to the spirits above and do me 

Ooh he's emotional
So emotional
He's an emotional man
I had my woman right here
I had her in the palm of my hand
Want you to come and do me
Ooh he's emotional
So emotional
He's an emotional man
He's got tears in his eyes
Watch him break down and cry
Cry -
Cry - Hear me babe was soll ich Dir noch sagen
Cry - Es ist doch alles schon gesagt, Du siehst ja wo ich bin
Cry - Can't you see I'm down on my knees
Cry - But I'll tell you something wenn nicht, dann nicht 

Ooh he's emotional
So emotional
He's an emotional man
I had my woman right here
I had her in the palm of my hand
Want you to come and do me
Ooh he's emotional
So emotional
He's an emotional man
He's got tears in his eyes
Watch him break down and cry
Cry -
