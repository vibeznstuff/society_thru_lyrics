I was half in mind, I was half in need
And as the rain came down, I dropped to my knees and I prayed
I said, "Oh Heavenly thing, please cleanse my soul
I've seen all on offer and I'm not impressed at all"

I was halfway home, I was half insane
And every shop window I looked in just looked the same
I said, "Now send me a sign to save my life
'Cause at this moment in time there's nothing certain
In these days of mine"

See, it's a frightening thing when it dawns upon you
That I know as much as the day I was born
And though I wasn't asked I might as well stay
An' promise myself each and every day that

When you're knocked on your back an' your life's a flop
And when you're down on the bottom there's nothing else
But to shout to the top

You gonna shout to the top
We gonna shout to the top
We gonna shout to the top
We gonna shout to the top

See, it's a frightening thing when it dawns upon you
That I know as much as the day I was born
And though I wasn't asked I might as well stay
An' promise myself each and every day that

We gonna shout to the top, shout
We gonna shout to the top, shout
We gonna shout to the top, shout

We gonna shout to the top, shout
We gonna shout to the top, shout
We gonna shout to the top, shout

So when you're knocked on your back an' your life's a flop
And when you're down on the bottom there's nothing else
But to shout to the top, shout

We gonna shout to the top, shout
We gonna shout to the top, shout
We gonna shout to the top, shout

And when you're knocked on your back an' your life's a flop
And when you're down on the bottom there's nothing else
But to shout to the top, shout

We gonna shout to the top, shout
We gonna shout to the top, shout
We gonna shout to the top, shout

Shout to the top, shout...
