I love it when we do what we 

Ahahahaaaaaaaaaaaa 

When you're around the sun is always shining
And since we met I haven't once stopped smiling
The love I feel for you is almost blinding yeah

I'm running up and down the street
Hugging everyone I meet
Now you love me life is sweet
When I got you in my arms
I can't turn off the fire alarms yeah 

I love it when we do what we do 

because we do what we do till it's done
I love the way we do what we do

because we do what we do and it's fun

you're the one

When you're around my eyes will never wander
And there ain't no-one else I've ever been more fonder of
So baby don't you break this spell I'm under yeah

When I look into your eyes I don't have to fantasize
You're a dream that's realised
I'm dancing on the moon inside
If life is cruel then someone lied

I love it when we do what we do 

because we do what we do till it's done
I love the way we do what we do

because we do what we do and it's fun

you're the one

I dig it when we kiss and we hug and you're cuter than a bug in a rug my love

When you and me
no to end to us
It makes me cry
It makes me trust

repeat chorus 

When you and me
taste so sweet
It makes me cry
It makes me trust
