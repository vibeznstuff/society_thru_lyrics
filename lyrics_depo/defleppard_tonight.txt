Ohhhh...Oooooh... 
I don't wanna play 
The waiting game 
And drift away 
Leavin' an illusion 
I don't wanna hide 
It's foolish pride 
To close my eyes 
A touch away from wanting you 

Don't try to look away 
When we're face to face 
I see your eyes 
That animal emotion 
You don't have to set 
Your tender trap 
It's in those eyes 
It's gonna happen anyway 

(Movin' to the rhythm of your heartbeat) 
Yeah, I'm wantin', willin', touchin' you 
We'll be 
(Movin' to the rhythm of your heartbeat) 
Ooh babe 
When you get that rhythm 
Gonna move into your room 

Tonight - Gimme love with no disguise 
Tonight - I see the fire in your eyes 
Tonight - So right, this night could be dynamite 
Wait'n'see 
If it pleases you it pleases me 

There's nothing I can say 
No mystery 
It's in your eyes 
Those eyes are where I wanted them 
So give me heart'n'soul 
I lose control 
Can't stop my eyes 
From fallin' into fantasy 




Tonight - Gimme love with no disguise 
Tonight - I see the fire in your eyes 
Tonight - I wanna win the greatest prize 
Tonight - So right, this night could be dynamite 
Wait'n'see 
If it pleases you it pleases me
