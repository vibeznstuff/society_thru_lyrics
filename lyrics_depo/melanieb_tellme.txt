What made you think I would be fooled 
I now see through you 
And you're the fool 
Tell me 
How do you feel when you see me 
And I disregard you 
There's someone new 
And they're true 
I can't believe I was so blind I didn't see 
That you couldn't be the type of man to meet my needs 
Strangest thing is everyone tried to tell me 
But I did what they told me not to 

You nearly had my everything 
by running game on me 
You told me all I had to hear 
I thought love was finally here 
But then one day the truth I'd see your game was incomplete 
Cos when I realised the truth 
I see your plan, you're not my man so get from under my roof 
(I don't want you) 

What made you think I would be fooled (Be fooled) 
I now see through you (Yes I do) 
And you're the fool 
Tell me (Tell me) 
How do you (How do you) 
feel when you see me (When you see me) 
And I disregard you (Disregard you) 
There's someone new 
And they're true 

It was the saddest thing I thought there was no help for me 
Cos you made me think I wasn't worth anything 
Now I see you didn't have no self esteem 
And all you loved was Mel B's money 

You nearly had my everything 
by running game on me 
You told me all I had to hear 
I thought love was finally here 
But then one day the truth I'd see your game was incomplete 
Cos when I realised the truth 
I see your plan, you're not my man so get from under my roof 
(I don't want you) 

What made you (Made you) 
think I would be fooled (think I would be fooled) 
I now see through you (I can see through you) 
And you 're the fool (you're the fool, baby, you're the fool) 
Tell me 
How do you feel when you see me (When you see me) 
And I disregard you (Oh...) 
There's someone new 
and they're so true 

You nearly had my everything, by running game on me 
You lied to me, why did you lie to me 
But then one day the truth it seems your game was incomplete 
I found out the truth 
I see your plan, you're not my man so get from under my roof 
(I don't want you) 

What made you think I would be fooled 
I now see through you (I'm glad I saw through you) 
And you're the fool 
Tell me (Tell me, tell me) 
How do you feel when you see me (Do when you see) 
And I disregard you (Disregard you) 
There's someone new (One new) 
and they're so true (And they're so true) 

What made you think I would be fooled 
I now see through you 
And you're the fool 
Tell me 
How do you feel when you see me 
And I disregard you 
There's someone new and they're true
