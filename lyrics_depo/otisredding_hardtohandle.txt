Hey there, here I am 
I'm the man on the scene
I can give you what you want
But you got to come home with me

I forgot some good old lovin'
And I got some more in store
When I get to thrown it on you
You got to come back for more

Toys and things that come by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drug store lovin'
Hey little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle, now, yessir'am

Action speaks louder than words
And I'm a man of great experience
I know you got another man
But I can love you better than him

Take my hand, don't be afraid
I wanna prove every word I say
I'm advertisin' love for free
So, you can place your ad with me

Once it come along a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but ten cent lovin'
Hey little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle, now, yessir'am

Baby, here I am
The man on your scene
I can give you what you want
But you got to come home with me

I forgot some good old lovin'
And I got some more in store
When I get to thrown it on you
You got to come runnin' back for more

Once it come along a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drug store lovin'
Hey little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle, now, yessir'am
