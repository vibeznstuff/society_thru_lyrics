She said: "Baby our love's just like your songs 
The beat ain't bad but the words are all wrong 
It's time to pack my bags, it's time to just move on" 
She sang: "Johnny, I'm gone, gone, gone" 
And she was gone, yeah 

Me and Leigh met summer of '95 
In a burgundy dress lookin' finer than a French wine 
A Cajun queen with another side 
She was a schoolboy's dream, I was out of my mind 
She was lookin' fine 
She said: "You wanna drive me home" 
But what I didn't know ...... 

Ooh, ooh, (shalala) I was dancing with the Queen of New Orleans 
Ooh, ooh, (shalala) dancing in the streets of New Orleans 
Ooh, ooh, (shalala) dancing cheek to cheek in New Orleans 
Ooh, ooh, (shalala) it was almost like a dream (almost like a dream) 

That night I made my move 
Man I fell hard when I put my hands in her cookie jar 
She was more than a girl, she was a cabaret star 
I was a deer in the lights of a speeding car 
Nothing's what it seems, she was a Venus De Milo in her sister's jeans 

Ooh, ooh, (shalala) I was dancing with the Queen of New Orleans 
Ooh, ooh, (shalala) dancing in the streets of New Orleans 
Ooh, ooh, (shalala) dancing cheek to cheek in New Orleans 
Ooh, ooh, (shalala) it was almost like a dream (almost like a dream) 



Ooh, ooh, (shalala) I was dancing with the Queen of New Orleans 
Ooh, ooh, (shalala) dancing in the streets of New Orleans 
Ooh, ooh, (shalala) I was dancing cheek to cheek in New Orleans 
Ooh, ooh, (shalala) dancing with the Queen down Bourbon Street 

Ooh, ooh, (shalala) dancing with the Queen of New Orleans 
Ooh, ooh, (shalala) dancing in the streets of New Orleans 
Ooh, ooh, (shalala) nothing's what it seems in New Orleans 
Ooh, ooh, (shalala) dancing with the Queen of New Orleans 

Ooh, ooh, (shalala) dancing with a Queen of New Orleans 
Ooh, ooh, (shalala) dancing with the Queen of New Orleans 
Ooh, ooh, (shalala) dancing with the Queen of New Orleans
