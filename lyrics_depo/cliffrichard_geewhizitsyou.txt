Well, who's that a-walkin' down the street
Pickin' up those dainty little feet
Who's the one that catches my eye
Everytime she passes by - gee whiz it's you

Ever since we said goodbye, all because of a little white lie,
Let me tell you why we parted, let me tell you what my heart says,


Gee whiz it's you, you're the one that's makin' me blue
Gee whiz it's you, you're the one who can't be true

Little darlin' won't you hear my plea
Won't you please come back to me,
We can pick up where we started, listen now to what my heart says,
Ummmm - gee whiz it's you...



Little darlin' won't you hear my plea
Won't you please come back to me,
We can pick up where we started, listen now to what my heart says,
Ummmm - gee whiz it's you...

Gee whiz it's you
Gee whiz it's you
