Meet me on the other side, meet me on the other side 
I'll see you on the other side, see you on the other side 

Honey now if I'm honest, I still don't know what love is 
Another mirage folds into the haze of time recalled 
And now the floodgates cannot hold 
All my sorrow all my rage 
A tear that falls on every page 

Meet me on the other side, meet me on the other side 
Maybe I oughta mention, was never my intention 
To harm you or your kin, are you so scared to look within 
The ghosts are crawling on our skin 
We may race and we may run 
We'll not undo what has been done 
Or change the moment when it's gone 
Meet me on the other side, meet me on the other side 
I'll see you on the other side, see you on the other side 
I know it would be outrageous 
To come on all courageous 
And offer you my hand 
To pull you up on to dry land 
When all I got is sinking sand 
That trick ain't worth the time it buys 
I'm sick of hearing my own lies 
And love's a raven when it flies 

Meet me on the other side, meet me on the other side 
I'll see you on the other side, see you on the other side 
Honey now if I'm honest, I still don't know what love is
