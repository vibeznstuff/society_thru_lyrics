Yeah ehh ehh
Ah oooh ooh
Dib um dib dib dib dib dib dib

I always thought that our relationship was good
You played the role of having sense
I always played the fool
Now something's different
I don't know the reason why
Whenever we separate
I almost want to cry

Oh no, please not that again
Love rears up its ugly head

And when I come home late you don't complain or call
so as a consequence I don't go out at all
My friends are frightened
They don't know what's going on
They think you put a spell on me
And now my mind is gone

Oh no, please not that again
Love rears up its ugly head
...its ugly head

Love's not so bad they say
but you never know where love is gonna go

Does anybody really know oh?

(Check this out...)

I'm standing at the altar
As they play the wedding march
I'm in a black tuxedo with my collar full of starch
She looks as lovely as she's ever gonna get
I wake up from this nightmare in a pool of sweat

Oh no, no, no, no
Not that again...yeah...

I'm not goin'
I'm not goin when
Love rears up its ugly head

No not me 
No no not me when
Love rears up its
Love rears up its ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly head

What you gonna do
What you gonna do when it comes and gets you?
