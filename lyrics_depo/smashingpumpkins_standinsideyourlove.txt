You and me 
Meant to be 
Immutable 
Impossible 
It's destiny 
Pure lunacy 
Incalculable 
Insufferable 
But for the last time 
You're everything that I want and ask for 
You're all that I'd dreamed 
Who wouldn't be the one you love 
Who wouldn't stand inside your love 
Protected and the lover of 
A pure soul and beautiful you 
Don't understand 
Don't feel me now 
I will breathe 
For the both of us 
Travel the world 
Traverse the skies 
Your home is here 
Within my heart 
And for the first time 
I feel as though I am reborn 
In my mind 
Recast as child and mystic sage 
Who wouldn't be the one you love 
Who wouldn't stand inside your love 
And for the first time 
I'm telling you how much I need and bleed for 
Your every move and waking sound 
In my time 
I'll wrap my wire around your heart and your mind 
You're mine forever now 
Who wouldn't be the one you love and live for 
Who wouldn't stand inside your love and die for 
Who wouldn't be the one you love
