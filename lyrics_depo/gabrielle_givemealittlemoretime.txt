You try your best to show me
That you really care
You said, if there were days I was lonely to call you
You'd be there

You tried your best to convince me
That you understand
And if I ever need someone to hold on to
You wanted to be the man

And I knew, it was true
All the feelings that I had inside for you
I cannot deny
Many times I've tried, hoo, hoo

Give me a little more time
I need to make up my mind
'Cause you know I'm in two minds
I wanna be more than your friend
Oh, I just can't pretend any longer
Feeling's gettin' stronger

Give me a little more time
I need to make up my mind
'Cause you know I'm in two minds
I wanna be more than your friend
Oh, I just can't pretend any longer
Feeling's gettin' stronger

You've been there when I needed
You've never let me down
(Ha, ooh)
I just don't know how I'd cope without you
Being around
(Ha, ooh)

Feeling's have grown between us
And friends we have been
(Ha, ooh)
Don't you think it complicates this or is it
Just me?

Then I knew, it was true
All these feelings that you had
I shared them too
I cannot deny, the many times I lied, hoo, hoo

Give me a little more time
I need to make up my mind
'Cause you know I'm in two minds
I wanna be more than your friend
Oh, I just can't pretend any longer
Feeling's gettin' stronger

Give me a little more time
I need to make up my mind
'Cause you know I'm in two minds
I wanna be more than your friend
Oh, I just can't pretend any longer
Feeling's gettin' stronger

Oh, ooh
All the feeling's that I had are for you
I cannot deny
Oh, I just can't pretend any longer
Feeling's gettin' stronger
  (Give me a little more time)
Oh, ooh
  (I need to make up my mind)

Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
  ('Cause you know I'm in two minds)
Da, da, da, da
  (I wanna be more than your friend)
(Oh, I just can't pretend any longer)
Da, da, da
Feeling's gettin' stronger

Oh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
  (Give me a little more time
(I need to make up my mind)
All the feelin's that I had are for you
I cannot deny
  ('Cause you know I'm in two minds)
(I wanna be more than your friend)
(Oh, I just can't pretend any longer)
Feeling's gettin' stronger
