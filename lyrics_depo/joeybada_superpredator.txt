Yeah
Ride with a nigga
Statik Selektah
Ride with a nigga
Yeah

Call me the general
Push in and over genital
For my millennials, for the youth and the fellas too
Trying to be perennial, but chance of living is minimal
She critical - exactly what made my niggas criminals
Typical AmeriKKKa, damn sure ain't no miracle
Word to Steezy, Imma keep this shit lyrical
'Til I fall out my physical
All my verses is biblical, uh
Flowing religiously, my delivery spiritual, uh
Feelin' invincible, this here is nothing new
This is just principle - take notes, if I were you
They say I'm a clumsy king, how I be dropping jewels
But see the funny thing is I got lots to lose
Never no fucks to give, only one life to live
So I exchange my negative for a positive
And it's all
Good Lord
The pen is way mighty than the sword
Who want war? I told you before

How I kick in the door
With the rugged war, back just to re-install
What you niggas thought it was?
Yes I'm a veteran, you just a come up
About to teach you a lesson
How to get your hunger up?
Homie ya
How I kick in the door
With the rugged war, back just to re-install
What you niggas thought it was?
Yes I'm a veteran, you just a come up
About to teach you a lesson
How to get your fuckin' hunger up nigga

Badmon we a run tings, yeah
Never let the tings run we, uh
All the gyaldem, uh, come pre
And I tell 'em that the tele never come free
Badmon we a run tings, yeah
Never let the tings run we, oh
All the gyaldem, uh come pre
And I tell 'em that the body never come free


Super predator, filthy AmeriKKKa
Burn the newspapers and the editors
My dead presidents ain't dead enough
Blew a zip to the head, still ain't red enough
Pray to Jesus, hope he got you
No I'm not a chicken, I never listen to FOX News
Niggas built the country but never giving they props due
Paying for my people, I'm still payin' for my pops dues
I'm royalty, my momma said it
I'm gold hearted, I'm scum headed
Lost soul in a promised land of promises
Gotta mask on, but no I'm not anonymous
Built on my lonely, no accomplices
Light a L up for my accomplishments
I'm a real nigga, it's not a lot of 'em
If they were, then the cops probably shot at 'em


Badmon we a run tings, yeah
Never let the tings run we, uh
All the gyaldem, uh, come pre
And I tell 'em that the tele never come free
Badmon we a run tings, yeah
Never let the tings run we, oh
All the gyaldem, uh come pre
And I tell 'em that the body never come free

Yeah
I Stomp the grass in my Timbalands
Ain't nothing colder than New York when that December ends
The coldest shoulders
From average joes and the simple mans
I pack the heat cause I'm known around to be simmering
That mean I'm finna hit the boilin' point like real soon
Man, I've been heating up
My self esteem been on the move
The flow is hotter than volcanic craters near the equator
Any debaters is simply haters
They know that I'm greater
I be countin' my paper, forever fuck all the majors
Did it all on my own, don't owe nobody no favors
It's clear, I'm heir to the throne
I've been the best in my zone
Internationally known, forever Brooklyn's own
I mean
But here's for the Presidents, the Congressmen, the Senators
Who got us all slaving while they reaping all the benefits
Got the world thinking that it's true 'bout what they said of us
AmeriKKKa's worst nightmare, the super predator
