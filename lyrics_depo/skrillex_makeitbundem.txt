Loud greetings to the world
Vice ala one big GongZilla
'Longside Skrillex
End for now!
Oh wait!
I won't!

We mash up the place
Turn up the bass
And mek dem all have fun
A-we ablaze the fire
Make it bun dem

We mash up the place
Turn up the bass
And mek sum soundboy run
And we will end your week
Just like a Sunday

We mash up the place
Turn up the bass
And mek dem all have fun
Skrillex ablaze the fire
Make it bun dem

We mash up the place
Turn up the bass
And mek sum soundboy run
And we will end your week
Just like a Sunday

Rude boy!
Rude boy!
Rude boy!
Rude boy!

Hop on opposed
What people supposed
And too we opposed
And wouldn't suppose

We killing the floors
We're sicker than most
We pitching the post
Now we let the moles in

Never ya falter
Never ya fluff
Never ya tire
And never ya stop

Keep up your guard
And never ya drop
All them a-talk
And all them a-chat

Skrillex and Gong
The legend lives on
We give dem it hard
We give dem it strong

We give dem it rough
We give it long
We give dem it right
And never yet wrong

Sweeter the victory, the hotter the battle
The bigger the cover, the fatter the bottle
The bass have been rucklin', I might have to knuckle this!
Rude boy bass!
Mash up the place!

We mash up the place
Turn up the bass
And mek dem all have fun
A-we ablaze the fire
Make it bun dem

Turn up the bass
And mek sum soundboy run
And we will end your week
Just like a Sunday

We mash up the place
Turn up the bass
And mek dem all have fun

Turn up the bass
And mek sum soundboy run
And we will end your week
