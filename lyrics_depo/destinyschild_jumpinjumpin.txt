Ladies leave yo man at home
The club is full of ballas and
They pockets full grown
And all you fellas leave yo girl
With her friends
Cause its 11:30 and the club is
Jumpin, jumpin 


So you say you've got a girl?
Yes do you got a man?
But the party aint gon stop 
So lets make it hot hot! 


last weekend you stayed at home
Alone and lonely
Couldnt find yo man 
He was chillin with his homies
This weekend you goin out 
If he try to stop you, you goin off
You gotcha hair done and your nails done too
And your outfit and your in your shoes
You parlaying at the hottest spot tonight
You're gonna find the brothas
Rollin in the Lexus, trucks and Hummers 







Call your boys 
Cause tonight you're not gon stay at home
So tell your girl she aint coming tonight you're goin solo
Cut her off is she talks some noise
You know you got the right to get your party on
So get your hair cut and your car washed too
Lookin' like a star in your Armani suit
You need to look your best cause
You're turnin heads tonight

Sexy women do your dance 
Fly ladies work yo man
All them fellas in the club 
Who can get down now?


Bounce with me, bounce bounce
Bounce papis work
Shake baby shake shake shake work it work it
Twist baby twist twist twist
You better dip that thang
