One ticket, please
Lord have mercy, everybody's there
Hey, what's goin' on man, yeah
She's at home, yeah, she's at home
Yeah, she's at home

Let the music play
I just wanna dance the night away
Here, right here, right here is where I'm gonna stay
All night long...

Let the music play on
Just until I feel this misery is gone
Movin', kickin', groovin', keep the music strong
On and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on

I'm out here dancin' and still, huh
I can't erase the things I feel
The tender love we used to share
See, it's like it's no longer there
I've got to hide what's killin' me inside

Let the music play
I just want to dance the night away
Here, right here, right here is where I'm gonna stay
All night long...

Let the music play on
Just until I feel this misery is gone
Ah, movin', kickin', groovin', keep the music strong
Ah, let it play on and on, let it play on and on
And on, and on, and on, and on, play on and on, play

I think I'm gonna be alright, ha, ha, ha
If I can make it through the night, oh, Lord
I'll just pretend she's here with me
I'll close my eyes, her face I'll see
I know it's make believe, but it's the only hope for me

Let the music play
I just wanna dance the night away
Ah, here, right here is where I'm gonna stay
All night long...

Let the music play on
Just until I feel this misery is gone
Movin', kickin', groovin', keep the music strong
Let it play on, let it play on, let it play on
Please, let it play on, let it play on
