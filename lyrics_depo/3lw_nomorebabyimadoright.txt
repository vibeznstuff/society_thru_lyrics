I'm getting a little tired of your broken promises promises
Looking at your pager seeing different numbers and numbers 
Call you on your cell you hangin' the fellas the fellas 
Hangin' with my girls you always getting jealous n' jealous

I was with you when you didn't have no dollars no dollars
Hangin at the crib chillin' with ya mama ya mama
Never fronted you never brought the drama the drama
Now you flip the script player, please

No I'm not the one 
(Say it again Say it again oh)
No I'm not the one 
(You do or you don't)


You do or you don't don't 
You will or you won't won't
No more No more baby I'ma do right

You can or you can't can't 
Be a man Be a man man
No more baby I'm do right

You treat me like a lady when you open doors and doors
But then you want to front when you with your boys your boys
How you gonna play when I brought your clothes yo clothes
The one that you be wearin' when you with yo does yo does

You know you never thought that I would have the nerve the nerve 
To think about it more since you at the curb the curb
Blowin' up my pager say you want a chance a chance 
Listen when I say player please




2 - No I'm not the one 
(Say it again Say it again oh)
No I'm not the one 
(You do or you don't)


I just wanna know
What happened to our love 
We used to be best friends 
Were did it go wrong
When ya gonna see 
How good it is to me
I'm tired and I'm through with all your "listen baby"


Hey yo you promised me Kate Spade 
But that was last year boy in the eighth grade
But you ain't Biggie baby boy
So no it ain't one more chance
And when yo friends around you don't wanna hold my han
And now you see a girl stylin' and wildin' inside the mix
Hoppin at the whips the whips the five and six
Yes fly chrome, so pardon my tone
Here go a quarter go call Tyrone






No I'm not the one 
(Say it again Say it again oh)
No I'm not the one 
(You do or you don't)
