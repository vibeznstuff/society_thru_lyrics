Late at night when you realize you’re on your own
I know the feelings inside you start to grow


Please tell me that it’s alright, alright, alright
I wanna know
Please tell me that it’s alright, alright, alright
I wanna know
Please tell me, tell me


‘Cause everybody’s got something
Something they can’t hide
Let it out into the open
Right here, right now

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh


When you turn up the light and you’re all alone
Cold as the shapes and the shadow’s gone


Please tell me that it’s alright, alright, alright
Tell me that it’s alright, alright, alright
I wanna know
Please tell me, tell me…


‘Cause everybody’s got something
Something they can’t hide
Let it out into the open
Right here, right now

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
(Everybody clap your hands now)
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
(Everybody clap your hands oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh


‘Cause everybody’s got something
Something they can’t hide
Let it out into the open
Right here, right now

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
(Everybody clap your hands now)
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
(Everybody clap your hands oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh

(Everybody clap your hands oh oh oh oh)
