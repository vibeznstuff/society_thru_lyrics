Said baby, what you want from me.
I'll give you anything.
Follow the river, leads to bigger streams.
Your love is everything to me.
Because my love runs deep as the ocean.
Oh let's sail away (until the light of day).
No ones gonna stop us now, you and me can face the love and pain.
Love &amp; Pain comes and goes, but I won't change, No.
Love &amp; Pain.
Said maybe, I'm the only thing you need.
I know you feel it don't you.
Or just maybe, perception is reality.
Either way I want you.
Because my love runs deep as the ocean.
Oh let's sail away (until the light of day).
No ones gonna stop us now, you and me can face the love and pain.
Love &amp; Pain comes and goes, but I won'tchange, No.
Love &amp; Pain.
That's what I like.
I will never leave you lonely.
That's what I like.
Love &amp; Pain.
