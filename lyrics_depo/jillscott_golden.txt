Heyyy, Ohh, Heyyy, Yeah, Ohh, Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeahhhh


I'm taking my freedom,
Pulling it off the shelf,
Putting it on my chain,
Wear it around my neck,
I'm taking my freedom,
Putting it in my car,
Wherever I choose to go,
It will take me far,


I'm livin' my life like it's golden
Livin' my life like it's golden, 
Livin' my life like it's golden, golden,
Livin' my life like it's golden, 
Livin' my life like it's golden, golden,


I'm taking my own freedom 
Putting it in my song,
Singing loud and strong,
Grooving all day long,
I'm taking my freedom,
Putting it in my stroll,
I'll be high-steppin' y'all,
Letting the joy unfold,



I'm holding on to my freedom,
Can't take it from me,
I was born into it,
It comes naturally,
I'm strumming my own freedom,
Playing the god in me,
Representing his glory,
Hope he's proud of me,




I'm living my life like its golden, golden, golden, golden, golden, golden, 




Livin' my life like it's golden,
It really matters to me, Ohhh
