What the hell is wrong with you tonight? 
I can't seem to say or do the right thing 
Wanted to be sure you're feeling right 
Wanted to be sure we want the same thing 

She said, I can't believe it 
You can't, possibly mean it 
Don't we, all want the same thing 
Don't we 
Well, who said anything about love? 

No, not love she said 
Don't you know that it's different for girls? 
(Don't give me love) 
No, not love she said 
Don't you know that it's different for girls? 
You're all the same 

Mama always told me save yourself 
Take a little time and find the right girl 
Then again don't end up on the shelf 
Logical advice gets you in a whirl 

I know, a lot of things that you don't 
You want to hear some? 
She said, just give me something 
Anything 
Well give me all you got but not love 

No, not love she said 
Don't you know that it's different for girls? 
(Don't give me love) 
No, not love she said 
Don't you know that it's different for girls? 
You're all the same 
You're all the same 
You're all the same 
You're all the same 
You're all the same 
You're all the same 
You're all the same 
You're all the same 

Who said anything about love? 

No, not love she said 
Don't you know that it's different for girls?

No, not love she said 
Don't you know that it's different for girls?

No, no, no, no, not love she said 
Don't you know that it's different for girls?

No, no, no, no, no, not love she said 
Don't you know that it's different for girls? 
You're all the same 
You're all the same 
You're all the same 
You're all the same
