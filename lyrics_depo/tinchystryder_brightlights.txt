Flash lights and the good life, keep calling out my name
And I pray somehow something’s gonna change
Bright lights in the skyline, let me lose my way
‘Cause I know somehow something’s gonna change

Uh, uh
From the ground to the sky
And it wasn’t overnight
Strydes

Last time running never went too well
Heart saying carry on, head’s telling me forfeit
Glimpse of the high life, I wish I never saw this
Now I want it all, want it all, I’m selfish
Felt locked down like I caught a death sentence
Like Alan Sugar fired me from The Apprentice
See my little weight, I must’ve lost half
Even Nando’s won’t send me a new black card
And there’s all opinions and assumptions
Back to the grind and there’s more where it comes from
I love the life ’cause my life flash cameras on
Tell Cheryl Cole and Rihanna that I love them

From young I’ve been obsessed with the fame
Know you’re in lane ’cause your dreams were the same
Every day I pray, really wishing for a change
Dreams to reality and now I’m in the game

Flash lights and the good life, keep calling out my name
And I pray somehow something’s gonna change
Bright lights in the skyline won’t let me lose my way
‘Cause I know somehow something’s gonna change

Tell me how you feel
Do you love me or hate me, there’s no pleasing everybody
Need to focus, then he lost track, I’m really sorry
Left the black clouds, bright lights got me feeling jolly
Never let you down, that’s my word you ain’t gotta worry
Work for this, don’t know about you but I work for this
Couple labels said I wasn’t worth the risk
Just another hoodrat hoodie with a black hat
He’s just one of them looking for a purse to nick
Never really had a plan B
Stayed on point, I am sharper than a Stanley
Big star, flash car, looking trendy
minogue on my list I ain't talking about Kylie

From young I’ve been obsessed with the fame
Know you’re in lane ’cause your dreams were the same
Every day I pray, really wishing for a change
Dreams to reality and now I’m in the game

Flash lights and the good life, keep calling out my name
And I pray somehow something’s gonna change
Bright lights in the skyline won’t let me lose my way
‘Cause I know somehow something’s gonna change

Let me tell you when to take it down
This is the part where the song breaks down
Stay looking up, never facing down
Long as the bright lights are blazing down

Flash lights and the good life, keep calling out my name
And I pray somehow something’s gonna change
Bright lights in the skyline won’t let me lose my way
‘Cause I know somehow something’s gonna change

Ha ha, I like that
