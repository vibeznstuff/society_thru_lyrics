First love
Last love
Only love
It's only love

First love
Last love
Only love
It's only love

Do you miss home?
Do you miss home?
And are you cool?
Symmetrical?

Let's get married
And tick the boxes
And so she says
Oh lets get married
And tick the boxes

Do you want to be alone?
Do you wanna be alone?
And are you cool?
Symmetrical
Hypocritical
Analytical
So critical
Nothing's perfect
And I'm hoping I'll do
But I will not do
Cause nothing's perfect
So I'll have to make do

And it's my mistake
And no mistake
And I would take it back if I could
So stay with me tonight

I'll make my bed, I'll lie in it
And pillow talk you into it
I'll make my bed, I'll lie in it
Entice you with this leopard print and matching velvet duvet

First love
Last love
Only love
It's only love

First love
Last love
Only love
It's only love

Only love
Only love

It's only love
