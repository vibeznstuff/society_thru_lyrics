I'm sitting here in a boring room, it's just another rainy
Sunday afternoon. I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do.
I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you,
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.

I'm driving around in my car, I'm driving too fast, I'm
Driving too far. I'd like to change my point of view.
I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you,
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.

I wonder how, I wonder why yesterday you told me
'Bout the blue blue sky and all that I can see is just
A yellow lemon tree. I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around.
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree.

Sing: dah...

I'm sitting here, I miss the power, I'd like to go out,
Taking a shower, but there's a heavy cloud inside my head.
I feel so tired, put myself into bed, where nothing ever
Happens - and I wonder.

Isolation - is not the good for me.
Isolation - I don't want to sit on a lemon tree.
I'm steppin' around in a desert of joy. Baby anyhow I'll get
Another toy and everything will happen - and you'll wonder.

I wonder how, I wonder why yesterday you told me
'Bout the blue blue sky and all that I can see is just
Another lemon tree. I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.

And I wonder, wonder
I wonder how, I wonder why yesterday you told me
'Bout the blue blue sky and all that I can see
And all that I can see
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.
