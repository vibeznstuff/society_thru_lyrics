I've been practicing all day
Now the words I meant to say are gone
I promised that I wouldn't cry
Told myself I had to try and hold on
The truth, I lied
I hate myself inside
And why
I played the game and paid the price
I never look back
I never cry never try to wonder why
I'll be on my own
And never doubt, never shout or wonder how
I'll never be lonely until
This time, this time, this time
This time I will
I've been wide awake all night
There's no sign of sleep inside my mind
The headlight shadows scan my wall
I convince myself you'll call in time
The truth, I lied
The girl in me has died
And why
I played the game and paid the price
I never look back...
This time I will be yours completely
This time I'll make sure you don't hate me
This time I know, this time I can and this time I will
I never look back...
I've been practicing all day
Now the words I meant to say are gone.
