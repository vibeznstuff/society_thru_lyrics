I carry the weight of you in my heavy heart
And the wind is so icy, I am numb
I carry the weight of you heading back to start
With the thousand eyes on me, I stumble on

I am tired, I'm growing older
I'm getting weaker every day, yeah
I carry the weight of you
I carry the weight of you

Lay down here beside me in the shallow water
Beside me where the sun is shining on us still
Lay down here beside me in the hallowed water
Beside me where the silver lining stays until
The sirens' calling

We follow the sun down low 'til we hit the night
And you hold me so tightly, it's hard to breathe, oh

And I'm tired, I'm growing older
I'm getting weaker every day, yeah
We follow the sun down low
We follow the sun down low

Lay down here beside me in the shallow water
Beside me where the sun is shining on us still
Lay down here beside me in the hallowed water
Beside me where the silver lining stays until
The sirens' calling
The sirens' calling

Yeah, I'm tired, I'm growing older
I'm getting weaker every day, yeah
I am drowning, and you're stealing every breath
Take me away and just

Lay down here beside me in the shallow water
Beside me where the sun is shining on us still
Lay down here beside me in the hallowed water
Beside me where the silver lining stays until
The sirens' calling
The sirens' calling
