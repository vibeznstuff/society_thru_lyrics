Tryna reign, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm I'm new
I'ma walk, I'ma march on the regular
Painting white flags blue
Love forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth
I'ma rain, I'ma reign on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new

I'm telling these tears, "Gonna fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames

Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

I'ma wade, I'ma wave through the waters
Til the tide, "Don't move"
I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders
Call me bullet proof
Love forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I'm new

I'm telling these tears, "Gonna fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames

Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves


Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice (One, two)
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blacks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements by my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqua ducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breath for me, sing for me
Honesty guidin' me
I can be me more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Cold on me, driving me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me
Like yeah
Open correctional gates in high deserts
Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads


Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves


What you want from me?
Is it true you see, uh? Oh father can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it true you see, uh? Oh father can you hear me?
Hear me?


I had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to pull myself up. I was served lemons, but I made lemonade
