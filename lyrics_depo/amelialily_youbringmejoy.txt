I've been thinking 'bout all the things I'm searching for
Twenty years from now, boy we could've done it all
I've been thinking 'bout all the times I've lost my head
I've been thinking 'bout all the things I never said
I won't think about all the things that could go wrong
Nothing left to shout, cause we got it going on
Standing in the crowd, yeah I know you won't be long
I'ma looking back, in a minute will be gone

Oh you bring me joy, yeah you bring me sadness
So you bring the love, so forget all the madness
I’m done with all the pain, I’m done with all the happenings
So you bring me joy, yeah you bring me sadness

Oh you bring me joy, yeah you bring me sadness
So you bring the love, so forget all the madness
I’m done with all the pain, I’m done with all the happenings
So you bring me joy, yeah you bring me sadness

I've been thinking 'bout everything I never had
All those crazy doubts, only gonna make me mad
I've been thinking 'bout everything I should've done
I'ma looking back, when I've only just begun
I've been thinking 'bout standing on the razor's edge
Looking up and down, questions running through my head
I've been thinking 'bout how I'll know which way to turn
I've been thinking 'bout lessons that I'll never learn

Oh you bring me joy, yeah you bring me sadness
So you bring the love, so forget all the madness
I’m done with all the pain, I’m done with all the happenings
So you bring me joy, yeah you bring me sadness

Oh you bring me joy, yeah you bring me sadness
So you bring the love, so forget all the madness
I’m done with all the pain, I’m done with all the happenings
So you bring me joy, yeah you bring me sadness

You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you

And maybe we were built to break
And this lasts a little more than we can take
Maybe we were built to last
And we're strong enough to break the past

Oh you bring me joy, yeah you bring me sadness
So you bring the love, so forget all the madness
I’m done with all the pain, I’m done with all the happenings
So you bring me joy, yeah you bring me sadness

Oh you bring me joy, yeah you bring me sadness
So you bring the love, so forget all the madness
I’m done with all the pain, I’m done with all the happenings
So you bring me joy, yeah you bring me sadness

You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you (yeah, you bring the sadness)
You, you, you (you bring me joy)
You, you, you, you, you, you
