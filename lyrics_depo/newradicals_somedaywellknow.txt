90 miles outside Chicago 
Can't stop driving 
I don't know why 
So many questions 
I need an answer 
Two years later, you're still on my mind 
Whatever happened to Emilia Earhart 
Who holds the stars up in the sky 
Is true love once in a lifetime 
Did the captain of the Titanic cry 
Someday we'll know 
If love can move a mountain 
Someday we'll know 
Why the sky is blue 
Someday we'll know 
Why I wasn't meant for you 
Does anybody know the way to Atlantis 
Or what the wind says when she cries 
I'm speeding by the place where I met you 
For the 97th time tonight 


Someday we'll know 
Why Samson loved Delilah 
One day I'll go 
Dancing on the moon 
Someday you'll know 
That I was the one for you 
I bought a ticket to the end of the rainbow 
I watched the stars crash in the sea 
If I could ask God just one question 
Why aren't you here with me? 



( seeing you in February was great 
cliches eventually all come true "time heals all 
wounds" I went to get us our ninth drink 
and you ran out the door with another guy 
I woke up on the floor with my shoes on 
A smile on my face and I don't even care)
