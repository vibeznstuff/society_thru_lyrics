You and him broke up
You and I hooked up
But you looked like a deer in the midnight headlights
Every time his name came up

Yeah I tried to make it work
But all I ever got was hurt
He was always on your mind, center line, every time
Waiting round every curve

Now here I am driving and driving and driving
Pretty soon you'll be calling and crying and trying
And dropping those lines on me
'Cause one more time's on me

But I don't have a comeback
I don't have a slowdown
I'm all out of what it takes to tap these breaks and turn around
When he breaks your spell like he always has
And you wish like hell we had what we had
My cell's just gonna keep saying "Leave a message, I'll call you back"
'Cause I don't have a comeback, comeback, comeback
Girl, I don't have a comeback

Every time we made love
Baby I would fall for us
But girl I could tell there was somebody else
Always tripping you up

Yeah, I've given e—given enough, girl
And now I'm giving it—giving it up, girl
You can have the last word
Hell, you can keep my t-shirt

But I don't have a comeback
I don't have a slowdown
I'm all out of what it takes to tap these breaks and turn around
When he breaks your spell like he always has
And you wish like hell you had what we had
My cell's just gonna keep saying "Leave a message, I'll call you back"
I don't have a comeback, comeback, comeback
Girl, I don't have a comeback, woah, woah

Come back home, come back in
Come back just to leave again
You're half-way dressed, half-way sober
Come back and let's talk it over

'Cause I don't have a comeback
I don't have a slowdown
I'm all out of what it takes to tap these breaks and turn around
When he breaks your spell like he always has
And you wish like hell you had what we had
My cell's just gonna keep saying "Leave a message, I'll call you back"
'Cause I don't have a comeback, comeback, comeback
Girl, I don't have a comeback, woah, woah

Come back home, come back in
Come back just to leave again
You're half-way dressed, half-way sober
Come back and let's talk it over

'Cause I don't have a comeback
