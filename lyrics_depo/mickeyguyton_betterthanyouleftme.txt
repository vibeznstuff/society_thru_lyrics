You said goodbye
With words cold as ice
I was shaking
Watching you go
I couldn't breathe
No, I just couldn't see
Past you leaving
Me here all alone
It's funny what a little time does, baby

I'm better than you left me
I'm better than I should be
Better than I was when you walked out that door
I'm stronger than the woman
The one that you knew back then
So don't you think I'll take you back
Like every time before
No baby, I don't think you know me anymore
I'm better than you left me

Now here you are
Trying to win back my heart
And I bet you
Thought it'd be easy to do
But baby I've changed
Now you get a taste of standing
On the side where you lose
Ain't it funny what a little time does, baby

I'm better than you left me
I'm better than I should be
Better than I was when you walked out that door
I'm stronger than the woman
The one that you knew back then
So don't you think I'll take you back
Like every time before
No baby, I don't think you know me anymore
I'm better than you left me

Now I love deeper
And I laugh a little bit louder
I smile brighter
And I fly higher

I'm stronger than the woman
The one that you knew back then
So don't you think I'll take you back
Like every time before
No baby, I don't think you know me anymore
I'm better than you left me
Oh, I'm better than you left me
