Boy I love it when I open my eyes and I see you beside me
You know what I want to do
Come closer I see you smiling
You're reading my mind that I'm ready to get it on
Don't worry I won't hold back
Don't want your time, we got plenty of that
Boy the way you look underneath the sunlight
Is bringing out my appetite
