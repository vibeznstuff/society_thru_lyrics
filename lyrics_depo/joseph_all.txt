Wake up love, it's morning
Immediately feel the weight
'Cause it's a day just like the other ones

I can see you hurting
You tell me quick that nothing's wrong
But I can see your posture bending heavy with it

You can carry gifts like burdens
Cause once you have a thing you love
You spend your time worrying you're losing it, losing it

If something matters to you
My babe, it matters to me
I'll go where you're going
Keep on holding
If something matters to you
My babe, it matters to me
I'll go where you're going
I'll keep on holding

I'm gonna give you my all
I'm gonna give you my all
I'm gonna give you my all
I'm gonna give you my all

I'm gonna give you my all, all, all
I'm gonna give you my all, all, all
I'm gonna give you my all
I'm gonna give you my all

If it matters to you
My babe, it matters to me
I'll go where you're going
Keep on holding
If it matters to you
My babe, it matters to me
I'll go where you're going
I'll keep on holding

I'm gonna give you my all
I'm gonna give you my all
I'm gonna give you my all
I'm gonna give you my all

I'm gonna give you my all, all, all
I'm gonna give you my all, all, all
I'm gonna give you my all
I'm gonna give you my all

I'm gonna give you my all, all, all
I'm gonna give you my all, all, all
I'm gonna give you my all
I'm gonna give you my all

Wake up love, it's morning
Immediately feel the weight
'Cause it's a day just like the other ones
