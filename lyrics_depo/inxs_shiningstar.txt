Mmmm I got a plan
Yeah, you got a plan
Gotta plan ahead
I got a plan that'll make you a star
Make you go rich, make you go far

Take your life and throw it on a bus
Make you feel like you make a fuss
Bright ideas and a fast hill too
Make you feel like you got feet of glue

Shining Star

take my soul, take my soul, take soul, take my soul

Just leave me with your heart, loving heart
loving heart, just leave me with your heart
Shining Star

There you go
Way up high

Joy in mind, cheat your heart
Make you wanna feel before it get's too hot
Let 'em gun you down while you run around
Before that shining star has gone
