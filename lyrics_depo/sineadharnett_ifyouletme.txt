Hurts me the most when I wake
I fumble and twist, 'til the truth starts to click
There's so much space in this bed
These sheets go for miles: dreams of your smile

I don't wanna be just a memory
And I don't wanna feel your wings break free
Because without you I'm lost in the breeze
I gotta be strong now, I gotta show you how

I'll love you like I've never, ever loved somebody
I'll give you things you didn't even know you wanted
Don't tell me that it's not enough
My time is up, you're over us
Cause I think I might do anything for you
If you just let me, if you just let me
If you just let me, just let me

Taste of your lips is still fresh
And the smell of your scent, how could I forget?
Your words how they cut me to shreds
But to tell you the truth every piece is for you

I don't wanna be just a memory
And I don't wanna feel your wings break free
Because without you I'm lost in the breeze
I gotta be strong now, I gotta show you how

I'll love you like I've never, ever loved somebody
I'll give you things you didn't even know you wanted
Don't tell me that it's not enough
My time is up, you're over us
Cause I think I might do anything for you
If you just let me, if you just let me
If you just let me, just let me

I'll love you like I've never, ever loved somebody
I'll give you things you didn't even know you wanted
Don't tell me that it's not enough
My time is up, you're over us
Cause I think I might do anything for you
If you just let me, if you just let me
If you just let me, just let me
