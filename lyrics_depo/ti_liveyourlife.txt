You're gonna be a shining star with fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far.
'Cause everyone knows just who you are-are.
So live your life, ay, ay, ay.
You steady chasing that paper.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
Ain't got no time for no haters.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
No telling where it'll take you.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
'Cause I'm a paper chaser.
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)


Never mind what haters say,
Ignore them 'til they fade away.
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away.
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today.
You still be wasting days away, nah had I never saved the day.
Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay.
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way.
I never been a hater still I love them in a crazy way.
Some say they sold the yay and no they couldn't even work on Labor Day.
It ain't that black and white, it has an area that's shaded grey.
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away.
Some move away to make a way not move away 'cause they afraid.
I brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away.
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt their face away.
Like I once made them spray, now I could make them plead their case away.
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break.
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away.


You're gonna be a shining star, with fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far.
'Cause everyone knows, who you are-are.
So live your life, ay, ay, ay.
You steady chasing that paper.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
No telling where it'll take you.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
'Cause I'm a paper chaser.
Just living my life.


I'm the opposite of moderate,
Immaculately polished with the spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid.
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics.
Articulate but still would grab a nigga by the collar quick.
Whoever having problems with their record sales just holla tip.
If that don't work and all else fails, then turn around and follow tip.
I got love for the game but ay I'm not in love with all of it.
Could do without the fame and the rappers nowadays are comedy.
The hootin' and the hollerin' back and forth with the arguing.
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in.
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'.
The cheques into your bank account and you up out of poverty.
Your values is a disarray, prioritizing horribly.
Unhappy with the riches 'cause your piss poor morally.
Ignoring all prior advice and fore warning.
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden aren't we?


You're gonna be a shining star, with fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far.
'Cause everyone knows, who you are-are.
So live your life, ay, ay, ay.
You steady chasing that paper.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
No telling where it'll take you.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
'Cause I'm a paper chaser.
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)

Now everybody watchin' what I do.
Come walk in my shoes,
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to.
I got my mind on my money and I not goin' away.
So keep on gettin' your paper and keep on climbin'.
Look in the mirror and keep on shinin'.
'Til the game ends, 'til the clock stops.
We gonna post up on the top spot.

So live your life.
