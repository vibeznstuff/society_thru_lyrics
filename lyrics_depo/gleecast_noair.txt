If I should die before I wake 
It's 'cause you took my breath away 
Losing you is like living in a world with no air 
Oh 

I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave 
My heart won't move, it's incomplete 
Wish there was a way that I can make you understand 

But how do you expect me 
to live alone with just me 
'Cause my world revolves around you 
It's so hard for me to breathe 

 
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air 
Can't live, can't breathe with no air 
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there 
It's no air, no air 
Got me out here in the water so deep 
Tell me how you gonna be without me 
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe 
It's no air, no air 

No air, air - No 
No air, air - No 
No air, air - No 
No air, air 

I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew 
Right off the ground to float to you 
There's no gravity to hold me down for real 

But somehow I'm still alive inside 
You took my breath, but I survived 
I don't know how, but I don't even care 

So how do you expect me 
to live alone with just me 
'Cause my world revolves around you 
It's so hard for me to breathe 

 
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air - (Uh - oh) 
Can't live, can't breathe with no air - (No - No) 
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there 
It's no air, no air 
Got me out here in the water so deep - (So Deep) 
Tell me how you gonna be without me - (Without Me) 
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe ( Breathe - No - No- aha) 
It's no air, no air (No - No) 

No air, air 
No air, air 
No air, air 
No air, air 
No more 
It's no air, no air 

 

No air, air 
No air, air 
No air, air 
No air, air 

You got me out here in the water so deep 
Tell me how you gonna be without me 
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe 
It's no air, no air 

No Air (No) 
No Air (No - No) 
No Air 
No Air 
No Air
