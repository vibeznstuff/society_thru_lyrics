I can't get a girl
Cause I ain't got a car
I can't get a car
Cause I ain't got a job
I can't get a job
Cause I ain't got a car
So I'm looking for a girl with a job and a car

Don't you know where you are?

Lost in America

I got a mom but I ain't got a dad
My dad's got a wife but she ain't my mom
Mom's looking for a man to be my dad
But I want my mom and dad to be my real
Mom and dad
Is that so bad?

Oh, I think I've been had

Lost in America
Lost in America
Lost in America
Lost

Lost in America
Lost in America
Lost in America

Well, I live at the 7-11
Well, I'm tryin' to play this guitar
Well, I'm learning "Stairway to Heaven"
Cause Heaven's where you are



I can't go to school
Cause I ain't got a gun
I ain't got a gun
Cause I ain't got a job
I ain't got a job
Cause I can't go to school
So I'm looking for a girl with a gun and a job
(And a house, with cable)

Don't you know where you are?

Hey man, you're...
