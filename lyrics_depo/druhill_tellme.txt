Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Tell me if it ain't good enough for ya babe
Tell me



Listen baby
Anything is possible
Anytime you want it girl let me know
I won't ask why just let it flow
Do your thing baby, take control
On my knees just say the word
No request is gonna go unheard
I'll take my time when I'm loving you
Foreplay at one won`t end till two




Candlelight we're alone
I'm up in your mix if you put me on
Talk to me I'll understand
Your need to feel a gentle hand
Now girl it's not my style, I can not lie
You know I like to serve it on the freaky side
What you want I can't ignore
So tell me what your lookin for, yeah




And you know, you know
When I lay you down
I can hear your body speak
Telling me to kiss you till your knees get weak
All night working that, working that, working that body baby
In the bed, or the middle of the floor baby
My love is gauranteed to make you go crazy
Said I don't see nothing wrong
With loving you all night long
