I don't wanna (no, no, no..)
a-a-ah
Never gonna be, (a fool, fool..), no more

Never thought i'd see the day
You'd play me
But you're the kinda guy who lies
To get along

So caught up in you're cheating world
With diamond studded rings and pearls
Now you cant deny it
And I will be the fool no more

Don't you tell me
I'm the only one
Cos something tells me
There's another one
Who calls you baby
Not the kinda girl to take so lightly

I don't wanna be a fool no more
Never gonna be a fool no more

All the times you said to me
I'll be there (I'll be there)
But you're the kind of boy
Who's time is nearly done (done, done..)

So caught up in you're cheating world (you're caught up, caught up)
With diamond studded rings and pearls
Now you cant deny it
I will be the fool no more

Don't you tell me (a-a-ah)
I'm the only one
Cos something tells me (a-a-ah)
There's another one
Who calls you baby (a-a-ah)
Not the kinda girl to take so lightly

I don't wanna be a fool no more
Never gonna be a fool no more

I don't wanna be
Never gonna be a fool no more

Don't you tell me (a-a-ah)
I'm the only one
Cos something tells me (a-a-ah)
There's another one
Who calls you baby (a-a-ah)
Not the kinda girl to take so lightly

I don't wanna

Dont you tell me (a-a-ah)
I'm the only one
Cos something tells me (a-a-ah)
There's another one
Who calls you baby (a-a-ah)
I'm Not the kinda girl to take so lightly

I don't wanna

Don't you tell me (a-a-ah)
I don't wanna be a fool
There's another one
Who calls you baby (a-a-ah)
no more

I don't wanna
