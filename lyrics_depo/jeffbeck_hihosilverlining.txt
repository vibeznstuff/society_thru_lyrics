You're everywhere and nowhere, baby
thats where you're at
Going down a bumpy hillside
In your hippy hat
Flying across the country
And getting fat
Saying everything is groovy
When your tyres are flat

And its hi - ho silver lining
and away you go now baby
I see your sun is shining
But I won't make a fuss
Though it's obvious

Flies are in your pea soup baby
They're waving at me
Anything you want is yours now
Only nothing's for free
Lies are gonna get you some day
Just wait and see
So open up your beach umbrella
While you're watching TV

And its hi - ho silver lining
and away you go now baby
I see your sun is shining
But I won't make a fuss
Though it's obvious

And its hi - ho silver lining
and away you go now baby
I see your sun is shining
But I won't make a fuss
Though it's obvious
