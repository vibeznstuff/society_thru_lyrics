I just heard that time will come to an end
In twenty thousand million years
I just heard the big bang
With my own ears 

People sit and worry about the future
Live your life 'cos the now is all there is 

Forever now
As the world goes round and round
One eternal moment in time
To live forever
Live forever now 

If I live one hundred years in this life
It still don't give me too much time
And time is still the one thing
That money can't buy 

People sit and worry about the future
Live your life 'cos the now it's all there is 

Forever now
As the world goes round and round
One eternal moment in time
To live forever
Live forever now 

Holy grail, holy cow
I just wanna live forever now
