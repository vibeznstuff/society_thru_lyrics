Y'know what..
It's time .. for you to surrender your love
uh uh uh 

It's not about what ya wanna know
The time is right that's for sure
It seems so silly but you complete me
Your hanging back just to see
Is another girl better than me
Looks so pretty she's the kind I lead


What is it you're looking for
I give you all you want and more
It's not tricky it's what it is what it is


So just surrender your love baby
surrender your love
surrender your love baby
surrender your love
uh uh nooo

Shy away from the deal
Ya sitting by something so real
You think your clever
but the other side is better


What is it you're looking for
I give you all you want and more
never felt like this before
is what it is what it is


So just surrender your love baby
surrender your love
surrender your love baby
surrender your love

Don't want you to let yourself go
there's so much more for you to know
surrender wont surrender wont no no no
It's time for you to see just what i'm worth
You've made me so proud to be the first
surrender wont surrender wont no no no


surrender your love baby
surrender your love
surrender your love baby
surrender your love
surrender your love baby
surrender your love
surrender your love baby
surrender your love ...........

It's time for you to surrender your love
