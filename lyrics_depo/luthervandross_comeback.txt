My heart and soul
And body too
Keep missin' you
What am I to do
The day's so long
And the night's so rough
; Cause it seems like I
Can't forget your love
It feels just like
I'm gonna fall apart
And I don't know how
I can make it now... so


Come back
You've been gone too long
You're on my mind
And it's hard to carry on
Come back
You've been away too long
My heart is weak
From being strong

I thought my sad face
Would make you stay
And it took me out
When you left that day
I sit and stare
But no one's there
In the room outside
That we used to share
When you're not here
It's a quiet place
It's a lonely house
Just an empty space... you gotta


Come back
You've been gone too long
You're all I need
And it's hard to carry on
Come back
You been away too long
My heart is weak
From being strong
Come back
You've been gone so long
I love you so
And I betcha I can show you
Come back
I got a love so strong
I'm missin' you, my baby
Ooh


I need you back now
You gotta come back, gotta come back
And I want you love
Please come back, please come back
I need you back right now
You gotta come back, gotta come back
And I want your love, my baby
