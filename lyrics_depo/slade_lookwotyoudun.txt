I know just exactly where to be
You know what my freedom means to me
What it means, what it means to me
Just exactly what my freedom means to me.

I say I know just what I want to be
You say what's it all supposed to mean
What's it mean. But we don't agree
Just exactly what's it all supposed to mean.


Hey hey hey hey what you doin' to me
Hey hey hey look wot you dun

I know what your mind is going through
You know my mind is going through it too
Through it too, going through it too
And you know my mind is going through it too.
