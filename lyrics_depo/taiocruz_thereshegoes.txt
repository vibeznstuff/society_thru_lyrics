She's A Thriller, Killer
Dance floor Filler

You know the rule of the game
More money, more leeches
And they’ll rob you like the Pharaohs in Egypt
But these boys all paraplegic
‘Cause they don’t know Pit is very prestigious
Me and this woman have telekinesis
Such as look and they go, look and they move, look and they shake
Look At The features, Beautiful Creatures
And make love to ‘em on beautiful beaches
Ready for the world but the world ain’t ready for me
Patience is as a virtue, wait and see
Don't believe? My baby es pa darte cosquillitas en tu kiki
Don't act like you don't know what I'm talkin' about
And your friends, who cares what they're talkin' about
She can play, go leave her with a little bit of Voli
She gonna let me score for sure, dale

There She Goes Looking Like A Star
With Her Body Shaped Like A Rock Guitar
There She Goes...
Like A Shooting Star
Make You Wanna Play
Makes All The Boys Them Say

There She Goes...
