Really?
I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.


Nope! But sometimes I like to close my eyes,
And imagine what it'd be like when summer does come. Ah.

Bee's they buzz, kids'll blow dandelion fuzz
And I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer.
A drink in my hand, my snow up against the burning sand
Prob'ly getting gorgeously tanned in summer.

I'll finally see a summer breeze, blow away a winter storm.
And find out what happens to solid water when it gets warm!
And I can't wait to see, what my buddies all think of me.
Just imagine how much cooler I'll be in summer.

Dah dah, da doo, uh bah bah bah bah bah woo

The hot and the cold are both so intense,
Put 'em together it just makes sense!

Rrr Raht da daht dah dah dah dah dah doo

Winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle,
But put me in summer and I'll be a - happy snowman!

When life gets rough, I like to hold on to my dream,
Of relaxing in the summer sun, just lettin' off steam.

Oh the sky will be blue, and you guys will be there too
When I finally do what frozen things do in summer.


I'm gonna tell him.


Don't you dare!


In summer!
