I've been coming round here now
For quite some time
And I think you got it figured out
But you don't look at me, how I look at you
You make it so hard for my love to get through

And I just know I'd make you happy
If you'd only let me in
You'll never really know unless you try
I could be, the, girl of your dreams
I strongly suggest, you don't let me pass you by

Its a lesson in simplicity
And I've spelt it out specifically
The rest is up to you
And it seriously bothers me
That you may just not ever see
The way I feel about you

I've got everything you need and
I want you to be with me
This not some crazy fantasy
I got everything you need

Take me for a ride in your big fancy car
I want to see how fast you can go
We'll drop the roof and we'll find the coast
And we won't stop driving 'till the sun sink below

And we can find a little place
That serves a chilled white wine
Somewhere we can be alone
And you can feel free to impress me
And we can play until its time to go

Its a lesson in simplicity
And I've spelt it out specifically
The rest is up to you
And it seriously bothers me
That you may just not ever see
The way I feel about you

I've got everything you need and
I want you to be with me
This not some crazy fantasy
I got everything you need
