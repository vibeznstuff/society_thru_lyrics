The baby's born in New York City
Wrapped in a blanket that's tattered and worn
Mama's doing the best she can
Findin' hope in a hopeless world
Her eldest boy
Well he stayed in school
Listen to mama
Didn't drink or use
But every job he wants
He gets refused
Is there hope in a hopeless world
Looking for hope in a hopeless world
Searchin' for love in such hateful times
Tryin' to stay strong
While the mind gets weak
I'm lookin' for hope in a hopeless world
On a corner stands a young girl
The home she left was from the better part of town
Her daddy did things she'd rather not talk about
Is there hope in a hopeless world
You gotta quarter for the homeless
Spare some changes for a soldier who fought the war
Put some money in those hats and in those tins
Give them hope in a hopeless world
Gotto find hope in a hopeless world
Lookin' for love in such hateful times
Lookin' for hope in a hopeless world 
I got to ease my mind
Ease my mind
You gotta listen to the voice inside you
That speaks of love
Don't compromise, realize
The time is quickly passing by
There are mountains to climb
You can't be standing still
The churches are full but the prayers are not heard
Saturday's child don't want to go to Sunday school
Whatever happened to the golden rule
Teach them hope in a hopeless world 
Somebody out there's got to listen
Somebody out there's got to know what I'm talking about
Raise your hand if you're with me
Give them hope in a hopeless world 
Gotta find hope in a hopeless world 
Gotta in love
Gotta find love in hateful times
Gotta find love
Gotta find love and free your mind
Gotta find love
Is there hope in a hopeless world 
Is there hope in a hopeless world
