Tell me,
Tell me that you want me,
And I’ll be yours completely
For better or for worse.

I know,
We’ll have our disagreements,
Be fighting for no reason.
I wouldn’t change it for the world.

‘Cause I knew
The first day that I met you
I was never gonna let you,
Let you slip away.

And I
Still remember feeling nervous
Trying to find the words to
Get you here today.

You make my heart feel like it’s summer
When the rain is pouring down.
You make my whole world feel so right when it’s wrong.
That’s how I know you are the one.
That’s why I know you are the one

Life
It’s easy to be scared of.
With you I am prepared for
What is yet to come.

‘Cause our two
Hearts will make it easy
Joining up the pieces
Together making one.

You make my heart feel like it’s summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it’s wrong
That’s how I know you are the one
That’s why I know you are the one

When we are together you make me feel like my mind is free and my dreams are reachable, whoa
You know I never ever believed in love, I believed one day that you would come along and free me

You make my heart feel like it’s summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it’s wrong

That’s how I know you are the one
That’s why I know you are the one
That’s why I know you are the one
That’s how I know you are the one
