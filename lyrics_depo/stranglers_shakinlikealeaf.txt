When you're lying in your bed
Wide awake with sleepy head
Thinkin' you should look beneath
And then you're shakin' shakin' shakin'

See a full moon in the sky
Time to be away and fly
Seems to be the sole relief
It's got me shakin' shakin' shakin'

Oh silent night
Give me some respite
Why must it be so brief
It's got me shakin'
It's got me shakin'
Like a leaf

Now that autumn's hit the ground
Every day and every sound
Says the world is changing round
It's got me shakin' shakin' shakin'

See the villains on their screens
Doing battle with their teams
Another week delays their grief
It's got me shakin' shakin' shakin'

Oh silent night
Give me some respite
Why must it be so brief
It's got me shakin'
It's got me shakin'
Like a leaf

Shakin' shakin' shakin' like a leaf
Shakin' shakin' shakin' like a leaf
Shakin' like a leaf
