I've waited, and given the chance again,
I'd do it all the same, but either way
I'm always outplayed, up on your down days
I left it the right way, to start again


Now watch me rise up and leave all the ashes you made out of me
When you said that we were wrong, life goes on, just look how long I've agreed

Now watch me rise up and leave all the ashes you made out of me
When you said that we were wrong, life goes on, just look how long I've agreed


Out of place, like a gem on a coalface
Lost on the right way, it's all the same
'Cause I've had my hopes raised, riding the wrong waves
Scared when you feel safe to start again


Now watch me rise up and leave all the ashes you made out of me
When you said that we were wrong, life goes on, look how wrong I could be

Now watch me rise up and leave all the ashes you made out of me
When you said that we were wrong, life goes on, you blew me away
Awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
Awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay 
Awaaaaaaay



I sink like a stone, I lost my control
