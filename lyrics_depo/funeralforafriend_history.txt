Dear friends of this academy
Oh, Romeo is bleeding to death..
To see a friend bleed to death
What for, some kind of metaphor
That I can't see..
So I'll drink until I see it.

This sky will make me sick,
So I'll give up on you,
I'll give up on this.
This sky will make me sick,
So I'll give up on this,
I'll give up on you.


Archers in your arches,
Raise your fingers for one last salute..
And bleed this skyline dry
Your history is mine.

So you want to hold me up and bring me down?
Yes, you want to hold me up and break me down

I don't care for your sweet scent
Or the way you want me more than I want you.
I don't care for your sweet scent
Or the way you want me more than I want you.



It's all mine.. it's all mine.. it's all mine...
