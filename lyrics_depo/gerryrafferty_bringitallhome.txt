I was lost on an endless sea
Going down, going down, going down on an endless sea
Sail with the wind, you weather the storm
You bring it all home, bring it all home, you bring it all home.

I was free in the dead of night
I want you, I want you, I want you in the dead of night
Give me your love, I'll sing you my blues
I bring it all home, bring it all home, I bring it all home.

I was blind in the light of day
I need you, I need you, I need you in the light of day
I still won't let go, hang on to this pride
I bring it all home, bring it all home, I bring it all home.

I was lost on an endless sea
Going down, going down, going down on an endless sea
Think to yourself as you're laughing it off
Bring it all home, bring it all home, bring it all home.


Yeah you think to yourself as you're laughing it off
Bring it all home, bring it all home, bring it all home.
