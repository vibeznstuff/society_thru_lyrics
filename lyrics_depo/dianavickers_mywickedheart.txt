Hush Hush Secret
Your secret's safe with me
Hush Hush Keep it
Under lock and key
I lead you follow

Coz I shiver
when you brush my lips
Stand-Deliver
You were made for this
I know I should go

Oh my wicked heart
Beats out of time for you
God knows I see stars
It's bad to feel this good
Whoops-coz I got that feeling
whoop-a, here I go again
Whoops no it aint for keeping
whoop-a here I go again

Big guns small drum
The beating of my chest
Slow touch fast tongue
I see magenta red.
I just can't be told.

Oh my wicked heart
Beats out of time for you
God knows I see stars
It's bad to feel this good
Whoops coz I got that feeling
Whoop-a, here I go again
Whoops no it aint for keeping
Whoop-a here I go again.

Look at you and me honey bee yeah whoops a daisy
Cuckachoo with me honey bee ahh whoops a daisy

Oh my wicked heart
Beats out of time for you
God knows I see stars
It's bad to feel this good
Whoops coz I got that feeling
Whoop-a, here I go again
Whoops no it aint for keeping
Whoop-a here I go again.

Oh my wicked heart
Beats out of time for you
God knows I see stars
It's bad to feel this good
Whoops coz I got that feeling
Whoop-a, here I go again
Whoops no it aint for keeping
Whoop-a here I go again.
