Are there no fighters left here anymore?
Are we the generation we've been waiting for?
Or are we patiently burning, waiting to be saved?

Our heroes, our icons have mellowed with age.
Following rules that they once disobeyed.
They're now being led when they used to lead the way

Do you still believe in all the things that you stood by before?
(That you stood by before.)
Are you out there on the front lines, or at home keeping score?
Do you care to be the layer of the bricks that seal your fate?
(Bricks that seal your fate.)
Would you rather be the architect of what we might create?

(Go!)

They laid out the blueprints,
They poured down a base
Concrete solutions to slow our decay.
But when they are gone
Who the fuck's gonna take their place?

Yeah, will it be the cynic, the critics galore?
The cliche apathetic, passed out on the floor
The trusting complicit who collectively ignore

Do you still believe in all the things that you stood by before?
(That you stood by before.)
Are you out there on the front lines, or at home keeping score?
Do you care to be the layer of the bricks that seal your fate?
(Bricks that seal your fate.)
Would you rather be the architect of what we might create?

Don't you remember when you were young, and you wanted to set the world on fire?
Somewhere deep down, I know you do.
And don't you remember when we were young, and we wanted to set the world on fire?
'Cause I still am, and I still do.

Make no mistake, we are not afraid
To bear the burden of repeating
What they're thinking anyway.
Let's raise the stakes
On the bet we made.
Let's decide to be the architects,
The masters of our fate.

Yeah, we still believe in all the things that we stood by before.
(That we stood by before.)
And after everything we've seen, there may be even more.
I know we're not the only ones and we were not the first.
(We were not the first.)
And unapologetically we stand behind each word.
