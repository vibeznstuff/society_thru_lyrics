I'm in luv
Round and round I go 
Out of control, I'm in luv
I'm in luv 
Round and round I go 
Out of control, I'm in luv 

Now from the very start
You knew you had my heart 
It was plain to see 
Ooo, good god almighty 
The way you work that body 
It was something to remember
And I dance all in this

Imagine you and me 
A gentle summer breeze 
What a lovely affair 
Champagne and candlelights 
Romance and moonlights 
Girl, I'm no geginner so I hope you're no pretender 

I can't deny 
Girl, you turn me on
Make me lose my self-control
Hold me close
I'm in luv 
Crazy love
Girl, I must admit it 
I am so addicted to your love 

Ooo la la 
Girl, you've got it 
All I need 
You can give to me
What I want
Is your sweet loving, baby 
Girl, I'm no beginner so I hope you're no pretender
