All the subtle flavors of my life
Are become bitter seeds
And poisoned leaves
Without you

You represent what's true
I drain the color from the sky
And turn blue
Without you

These arms lack a purpose
Flapping like a humming-bird
I'm nervous 'cause
I'm the left eye
You're the right

Would it not be madness to fight
We come 1

In you the song which rights my wrongs
In you the fullness of living
The power to begin again
From right now, in you

We come 1

I'm unafraid
Never never scared
Worries washed
Pressed air
I am the left eye
You're the right
Would it not be madness to fight

We come 1
