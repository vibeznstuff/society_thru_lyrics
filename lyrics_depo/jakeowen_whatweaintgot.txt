We all want what we ain't got,
Our favorite doors are always locked.
On a higher hill with a taller top,
We all want what we ain't got.

We ain't happy where we are,
There's greener grass in the neighbors yard.
A bigger house and a faster car,
We ain't happy where we are.

All I want is what I had,
I'd trade it all just to get her back.
She's moving on, but I guess I'm not..
Yeah we all want what we ain't got..

We all wish it didn't hurt,
When you try your best and it doesn't work.
And goodbye's such a painful word,
We all wish it didn't hurt.

All I want is what I had,
Yeah I'd trade it all just to get her back.
She's moving on, but I guess I'm not.
Yeah We all want what we ain't got.

Woah-oh-oh-oh 
Woah-oh-oh-oh

All I want is what I had,
Yeah I'd trade it all just to get her back.
She's moving on, but I guess I'm not.
Yeah we all want what we ain't got.

I wanted the world until my whole world stopped,
You know a love like that ain't easily forgot.
I guess we all want what we ain't got. 
Yeah we all want what we ain't got.
