You ever wanna live in the sky?
Sitting on a crown, watch the world go by
You ever wanna live in the sky?
Watchin' all the world go by

Sliding down a rainbow on a star
And everything below you looks so small
And everybody wonders who you are
But you tell 'em that you're not so tall

All together now
You ever wanna live in the sky?
Sitting on a crown, watch the world go by
You ever wanna live in the sky?
Watchin' all the world go by

Sitting on the moon with all your friends
Watchin' Mother Earth go rollin' by
You plant a little flag and then pretend
You're tryin' something no one else has tried

All together now
You ever wanna live in the sky?
Sitting on a crown, watch the world go by
You ever wanna live in the sky?
Watchin' all the world go by

All you need is love!
You ever wanna live in the sky?
Sitting on a crown, watch the world go by
You ever wanna live in the sky?
Watchin' all the world go by

You ever wanna live in the sky?
Watchin' all the world go by
