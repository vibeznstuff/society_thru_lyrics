Think, before you leave me, for somebody new
Make sure with your heart
Your mind's not fooling you
Think if there's another
I won't come between
But don't let careless kisses
Take away all our dreams
I think, you know darling
That I'm human too
If there's a chance for me
Take time before you choose
Cause I'll live a lifetime just loving you
So darling think, darling think
Cause I'll live a lifetime just loving you
So darling think, darling think
