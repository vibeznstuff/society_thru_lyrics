If a boy had a chance, a chance with someone like you
Are you gonna break his heart,
Let him cry for the moon
Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes?

(Behind those eyes)
I just freeze every time you see through me
And it's all over you,
Electric blue
(On my knees) On my knees,
Help me baby tell me what can I do?

Electric blue

Oh I had a dream, for a moment I believed it was true
Oh I'd have given anything just to be there with you
Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes?

(Behind those eyes)
I just freeze every time you see through me
And it's all over you,
Electric blue
(In too deep) In too deep,
Standing here waiting as I'm breaking in two
Electric blue
(I can see) I can see,
Can see that it may be just a vision of you
Electric blue
(On my knees) On my knees,
Help me baby tell me what can I do?

Electric blue

(Help me baby)

Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes?

(Behind those eyes)
I just freeze everytime you see through me
And it's all over you,
Electric blue
(In too deep) In too deep,
Standing here waiting as I'm breaking in two,
Electric blue
(I can see) I can see,
Can see that it may be just a vision of you,
Electric blue
(On my knees) On my knees,
Help me baby tell me what can I do?

Electric blue

(Behind those eyes)
I just freeze everytime you see through me
And it's all over you, 
Electric blue

Standing here waiting as I'm breaking in two,
Electric blue
(I can see) I can see,
Can see that it may be just a vision of you,
Electric blue
(On my knees) On my knees,
Help me baby tell me what can I do?
