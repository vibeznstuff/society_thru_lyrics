Oh...hey here I go, here I go

I know you heard men say it
Time and time again
That they would rock your world
And change your life
But I can’t blame them
Cause you make a nigga wanna get involved
Wanna get the drawers

And get at you
No disrespect but I want it bad as they do
The only difference is
they look out for themselves
But I’m doin’ it just to hear you yell..yeah

Girl when it’s goin’ down
Your body sayin’ O...
Don’t have to say my name
Girl I’m just glad you came
So you can say O...

In the night
You sayin’ O...
Means I was hitting it right O...
You can’t be mad at me

Let’s get this thing crackin’
You’ll be surprised when
You see what O’s I’m packin’
Cause I’m young but I’m ready
Tryna get hot and heavy
Turn you out if you let me

Somewhere that never been
Show you some things that
Make you wanna show your friends
Have you so weak that you
Can’t even say a thing
But that’s okay all you gotta say

Couldn’t believe me when I tell you
