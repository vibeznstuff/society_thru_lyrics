You know my heart beats rhythm and my dreams still take me higher
I've travelled round the world but they can't cure my desire
The city looks pretty tonight
Hold on now let's go till morning

Get up on love and stand by me
Stand by love, stand by me

I'm a shell shocked lover, under cover that's my game
I'm your long lost brother, little sister what's your name

I feel so alone
I'm stranded and so far from home I'm calling
Get up on love and stand by me
Stand by love, and stand by me
Stand by love

Love - stand by love stand by me
Stand by love stand by me

Give me one good reason why you don't come play with fire
'Cos when the earth starts moving you know I'm no liar

The city looks pretty tonight
Oh hold on now let's go till morning

Get up on love and stand by me
Stand by love, and stand by me
Stand by love stand by

Stand by love
Stand by love stand by me
Stand by love stand by me
Stand by love stand by me
Stand by love stand by me
Stand by love stand by me
Stand by love stand by love
Stand by love stand by love
Stand by me
