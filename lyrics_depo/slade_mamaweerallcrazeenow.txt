I don't want to drink my whiskey like you do
I don't need to spend my money but still do


Don't stop now a c'mon
another drop now c'mon
I wanna lot now so c'mon
That's right, that's right
I said Mama but we're all crazy now
I said Mama but we're all crazy now
I said Mama but we're all crazy now

A you told me fool fire water won't hurt me
A you tease me and all my ladies desert me



I don't want to drink my whiskey but still do
I had enough to fill up "H" Hill's left shoe



Mama mama mama mama oh yeah...
