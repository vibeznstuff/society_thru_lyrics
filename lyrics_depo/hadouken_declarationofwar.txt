I'm walking wounded on the ground
But I will stand here tall
I grow standing tall

If you want a war with me
If you want a war with me
If you want a war with me then bring your beef

If you wanna war with me
If you want war then you've got war

You tried to rip me
But I don't tear and I don't care
My skin is thick now
I learnt these lessons years before
This time I'm ready for your war
Now I'm ready for you war

I should have put this flame out years ago but you burnt my house down
And I won't move
And as I stand here alone in this dust
I've got nothing left to lose

I've seen your ways and
I know your plans
'Cause I've been around
And I've seen this place before
I wont do this anymore
But if you want war then you've got war

So pick your friends out
I'll take my place and you'll take yours
Load your guns up
And we'll declare an ex-lovers war
I should have seen this years before
But now I'm ready for your war

I should have closed these borders years ago
But you left me somewhere I know well
And as I stand here in no-mans-land
I contemplate your attack

I've seen your ways and
I know your plans
'Cause I've been around
And I've seen this place before
I wont do this anymore
But if you want war then you've got war

You can try and hurt me
I'll come back for more

I've seen your ways and
I know your plans
'Cause I've been around
And I've seen this place before
I wont do this anymore
But if you want war then you've got war
