Are you a man who loves and cherishes and cares for me?
Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?
Are you a guard in a prison maximum security?
Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?
Do we stay home all the time 'cause you want me to yourself?
Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?
Or am I locked away out of fear that I'll find someone else?
Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?


Well, I don't like (o-hoo)
Living under your spotlight (o-hoo)
Just because you think I might (o-hoo)
Find somebody worthy
Oh, I don't like (o-hoo)
Living under your spotlight
Maybe if you treat me right
You won't have to worry


Is this a relationship:
Fulfilling your needs as well as mine?
Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?
Or is this just my sentence
Am I doing time?
Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?
If this is love, real, real love
Then I'm staying no doubt
Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?
But if I'm just love's prisoner
Then I'm busting out (oh)
Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?




Oh, you ought to be ashamed of yourself
What the hell do you think you're doing
Loving me, loving me so wrong?
Baby, all I do is try (try)
To show you that you're mine (mine)
One and only guy (only guy)
No matter who may come along
Open your eyes 'cause, baby, I don't like
Ooh, ooh (oh, oh)
Ooh, ooh (hey, 'cause I don't like!)

Well, I don't like
Living under your spotlight (no, no)
Just because you think I might (hee)
Find somebody worthy (no, I don't like, yeah)
And I don't like
Living under your spotlight (living under your spotlight)
Maybe if you treat me right (treat me right, yeah!)
You won't have to worry

(I don't like)
