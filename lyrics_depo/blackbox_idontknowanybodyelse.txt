Tell me what you want and nothing more... 

I don't know anybody else 

I'll tell you what I know so well 
Your love is standing tall and swell 
Why! Come on out and hear him say 
Gonna get you now! Gonna get to you! 
We're livin' by this inspiration 

Come on, baby, come on! 
You 'n' nobody else 
Come on, baby, come on! 
Just walk this way 
Come on, baby, come on! 
You 'n' nobody else 
I wanna take you! So close to you! 

Just gotta touch me, touch me 

Can't you say it to my eyes, to my face? 
There's no need to wait 
Gonna get you now! Gonna get to you! 
We're livin' by this inspiration
