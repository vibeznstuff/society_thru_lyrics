(Welcome… and that’s just how we roll)


Oh, fitted tee black jewelry
I know I stand out
I don’t need to try fully
I check the lime light if you don’t think you’ll get quicker
It’s like catch me if you can like some gingerbread… oh
I never ride solo
It’s me and my chick looking like slow mo
And we only roll through guns blazin'
So you don’t wanna roll with either me or my lady

Time after time
They try and prove me wrong
And nobody knows the way she saves me


We have a real top shotta
Hotter than hotter
Boy I’m in, I look for no other
You know


You and me on our own
You should already know
It’s just me my baby oh oh
Me my baby oh
Back to back and reload
Pack our bags, hit the road
It’s just me my baby oh oh
Me my baby oh
And that’s just how we roll 

They say love can be deadly
I know this already
I know what I like
Stop trying to scare me
If only you knew
The things we’ve been through
Then maybe you would leave us both alone

So time after time
They try and prove me wrong
But nobody knows the way she saves me


We have a real top shotta
Hotter than hotter
Boy I'm in, I look for no other
You know


You and me on our own
You should already know
It’s just me my baby oh oh
Me my baby oh
Back to back and reload
Pack our bags hit the road
It’s just me my baby oh oh
Me my baby oh
And that’s just how we roll 

And I swear
Wherever we go from here
We’ll be one til the sky falls down
Yeah

You and me on our own
You should already know
It’s just me my baby oh oh
Me my baby oh
Back to back and reload
Pack our bags hit the road
It’s just me my baby oh oh
Me my baby oh
And that’s just how we roll 
(Me and baby) (I don't want you to ever leave)
Me and my baby ooh
