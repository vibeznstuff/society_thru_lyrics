Some people have to learn
Some people wait there turn
Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives


They wanna hold you back, tell 'em pee off
Whenever they say you can't, take the "t" off
I remember when they told me I wouldn't be famous
Now my dream and reality is simultaneous
And work your own way to the top
If they put you on a pedestal they can take you off
And there's a higher level than the top
You gotta make more, don't make do with what you got
Yeah, so get it in, go sonny
Not everybody gets a second chance at getting money
Or even getting lucky so you gotta feel
The hunger in your tummy


I'm always pushing myself to the limit
Making sure I stay ahead
You made me who I am, from the words you said

Some people have to learn
Some people wait there turn
Some people but not me
I was born a champion

Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives
Some people don't believe
But I was born a champion
But I was born a champion
But I was born a champion


This gonna be the realest shit I ever wrote
Off the record, no camera’s, forget a quote
Some of my family doing good, most doing dope
I'm from Virginia where they hang the niggas by a rope
I used to see my momma getting beat down
Is that the real definition of me now?
I fell off, back on my feet now
Headed to the sky, can’t even see down
Award shows, I poured my heart out
And people still steady trynna point my flaws out
And I’d be lying if I said it ain’t get to me
But I’m a champion, legend, history




Imagine you was the one, that couldn't get a look in
Couldn't get a booking
Couldn't get a push in when you needed a shove
Or your buttons they be pushing
So now they tryna shush him
It's only you believing in you
They turn you into a bastard the moment you rude
Attitude a little out of tune
But that's how champions move
Yeah so go and get it in sonny
Not everybody gets a second chance at getting money
Or even getting lucky
So you gotta feel the hunger in your tummy




No-one wants to help
I guess you're on your own
Build a foundation with the bricks they throw
In a black and white world, true colors show
Change if you want, everybody grows
Life's like an eel, but try and get a hold
Opinions ain't facts, take em and let em go


You made me who I am from the words you said

Some people have to learn
Some people wait there turn
Some people but not me
I was born a champion (champion)

Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives
Some people don't believe
But I was born a champion

Some people have to learn
Some people wait there turn
Some people but not me
I was born a champion (champion)

Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives
Some people don't believe
But I was born a champion
But I was born a champion
But I was born a champion
