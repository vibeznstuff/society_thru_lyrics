Te necesito profundamente, ahora!

Girl, light's out, candles lit
Tonight's gonna be a night to remember
And your body is gon' be saying thank you, like a Thursday in November.
And I promise I'mma work you hard.
Something like you never experienced
And girl I got just what you want right here!

So baby can we make love?

(Girl, you undress me with your sex-ray vision…)
And I promise I'mma make, I'mma make
