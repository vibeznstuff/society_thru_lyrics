I am watching the rise and fall of my salvation.
There's so much shit around me.
Such a lack of compassion. 
I thought it would be fun and games (would be fun and games).
Instead it's all the same (it's all the same).
I want something to do.
Need to feel the sickness in you. 

I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again.
It's quite decieving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad.

All I'll do is look for you.
I know your fix, you need it to
Just to get some sort of attention, attention.

What does it mean to you?
For me it's something I just do.
I want something.
I need to feel the sickness in you. 
I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again.
It's quite decieving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad.

Does it make me bad?
