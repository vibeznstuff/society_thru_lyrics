What is this feeling? I can't sleep at night
Just thinking 'bout being without you
Work 'til I'm tired and I can't eat a bite
'Cause I know someday is only...




I have the man that I want
I prayed so many nights for you and then my prayers came true
Now that I have the answer, I'll be wishing on a star
I'll follow you where you are

I don't wanna be alone so baby let's stay together
Through any kind of weather, yeah
Let's make a happy home because you mean so much to me baby
That's why I wanna be your lady
