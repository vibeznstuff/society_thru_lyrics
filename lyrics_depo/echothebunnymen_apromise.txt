You said something will change
We were all dressed up
Somewhere to go
No sign of rain
But something will change
You promised

You said nothing will change
We were almost near
Almost far
Down came the rain
But nothing will change
You promised

A promise
A promise
A promise

It's exactly the same
You said
It's always the same
But I'll make it change
Into something the same
I promise

A promise
A promise
A promise

Light on the waves
Light on the waves
Light on the waves
Light on the waves
A promise
A promise
A promise
A promise
(light on the water)
(we could sail on forever) a promise
A promise
(there's light on the water)
(we could sail on forever) a promise
(there's light on the water) a promise
(there's light on the water) a promise
(we could sail on forever) a promise
(there's light on the water) a promise
(there's light on the water) a promise
(we could sail on forever)
