Show me where I belong tonight. 
Give me a reason to stay. 
No matter if I go left or right. 
I always come back to love your love 

I've been up and down. 
Been going round and round. 
I've been all over town. 
But I'll never find somebody for sure 

Show me love tonight. 
I'm going to left to right. 
No matter where I go. 
Always find your love 

I've been high and low. 
I don't know where to go. 
Cause I love you so. 
And I'll never ever find someone like you for sure 

Show me where I belong tonight. 
Should I go left or right. 
I always come back to your loving, baby. 
Show me I where I belong tonight. 

Should I go left or right. 
I always come back to your love
