Standing here in the music hall
With my microphone and a glitterball
And you walk right in blowing through the doors
Like a force of nature, a force of nature


I can't look up cause my head's a mess
But you're beautiful in the way you dress
I'm lost for words and I'm powerless
Right from the beginning you've got me singing


Ooh
Singing ooh
Singing ooh
Singing oh
I'm so in love with you
Singing ooh
Singing ooh
Singing oh
I'm so in love with you
I'm so in love with you

I thought I'd lost you in the crowd
But how can I when you stand out?
You're like the sun to the evening rain
The bells are ringing, you've got me singing



And I feel love
Do you feel love?
And I feel love

I've only got eyes for you, for you
Just look and see, it's true, it's true
So tell me what to do, to do
Don't wait too long





And I feel love
Do you feel love?
And I feel love
