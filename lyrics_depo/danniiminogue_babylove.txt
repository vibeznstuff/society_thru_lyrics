My Baby
Baby love (you are my)
Baby love (just call me)

Boy, there's no one home tonight
The timing could be right
To forget the blues
We're out of school until tomorrow

Now, if only you would stay
There's so many games to play
Why should we pretend
To be just friends
When we could be so much more

Baby love (you are my)
Baby love (just call me)
Baby love (you are my)
Baby love (just call me)

Words, don't mean so much to me (mean so much to me)
I'd rather wait and see
See what happens when the lights go down 
With your arms around me

Time (time) to leave the world behind (leave the world behind)
Save it for another time 
'Cos I don't remember where I am
When you start to love me

Baby love (you are my)
Baby love (just call me)
Baby love (you are my)
Baby love (just call me)

Ooh
Sweet and tasty, baby, baby love
My baby
My baby

Boy, I want you by my side
There's no reason we should hide
How we feel when we are
Near each other, under cover

Warm (warm) I'll hold you close to me (hold you close to me)
You're perfection first degree
Cause I don't remember where I am 
When you start to, love me

Baby love (you are my)
Baby love (just call me)
Baby love (you are my) Oh
Baby love (just call me)

Baby love (you are my) Baby Baby
Baby love (just call me)
Baby love (you are my) Baby Baby
Baby love (just call me)
Baby love, you are my
