Mama, tell your children not to go
Down to the city, where the desperate people go
And mama, don't let them stray
They won't find, peace of mind, in such a lonely place
Wannabes and losers, all trying to get a break
They don't give a damn, they'll do whatever it takes
If they climb the ladder, they get to play for higher stakes
That's why there's low life in high places

Mama, things have changed since you were young
When you scream, in the dead of night
Now no one ever comes
And a poor man, he's cast as the villan and a thief
See him down on the street, begging for enough to eat

Waiting on the corner, I saw her waiting for the man
When the limo pulled up I saw what was changing hands
I should've tried to warn her, and make her understand
There is low life in high places

There is low life, like you never even knew
There is low life, and it lives in me and you
But we don't all let it through

Don't let 'em go, you've got to have some pity
Don't you let 'em go
You've got to keep 'em away, from the big bad city

Waiting on the corner, I saw her waiting for the man
When the limo pulled up I saw what was changing hands
I should've tried to warn her, and make her understand

Mama, tell your children not to go
Down to the city, where the desperate people go
And mama, don't you let them stray
They won't find, peace of mind in such a lonely place
