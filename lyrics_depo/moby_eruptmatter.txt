Step out of the dancehall
How my world got so small

(Pow pow erupt and matter)
(Pow pow erupt and matter)
(Pow pow erupt and matter)
(Pow pow erupt and matter)
And the veins begin to rust
In a space betrayed of trust

(Pow pow erupt and matter)
(Pow pow erupt and matter)
(Pow pow erupt and matter)
(Pow pow erupt and matter)

We don't trust you anymore
We don't trust you anymore

We believed your words, but now we see
You just don't mean, a thing to me
Your power reign was sick and wrong
Your time is gone, your time is gone
And we don't need ruin and lies
Your touch is death, your heart despised
Your time of reign and dark began
Your time to change is at an end

(Pow pow erupt and matter)
(Pow pow erupt and matter)
(Pow pow erupt and matter)
(Pow pow erupt and matter)

Wake up in the dancehall
Look around, is that all?

(Pow pow erupt and matter)
(Pow pow erupt and matter)
(Pow pow erupt and matter)
(Pow pow erupt and matter)

Sweet dreams of a dying way
Are these dreams of a dying day?

(Pow pow erupt and matter)
(Pow pow erupt and matter)
(Pow pow erupt and matter)
(Pow pow erupt and matter)

We don't trust you anymore
We don't trust you anymore

We believed your words, but now we see
You just don't mean, a thing to me
Your power reign was sick and wrong
Your time is gone, your time is gone
And we don't need ruin and lies
Your touch is death, your heart despised
Your time of reign and dark began
Your time to change is at an end

We believed your words, but now we see
You just don't mean, a thing to me
Your power reign was sick and wrong
Your time is gone, your time is gone
And we don't need ruin and lies
Your touch is death, your heart despised
Your time of reign and dark began
Your time to change is at an end

We believed your words, but now we see
You just don't mean, a thing to me
Your power reign was sick and wrong
Your time is gone, your time is gone
And we don't need ruin and lies
Your touch is death, your heart despised
Your time of reign and dark began
Your time to change is at an end

(Pow pow erupt and matter) 

Awake!
(Pow pow erupt and matter)
