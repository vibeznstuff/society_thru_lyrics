I'm just a little tin soldier in your hands
I'm good for nothing but to obey your commands
You'll never really love me, I know
So wind me up, let me go

I'm just your plaything 'till you see someone else
And then you leave me alone on the shelf
But even tin soldiers have hearts don't you know
So wind me up, let me go

You don't really need me
You've a hundred other toys
And tear drops don't look good in the eyes of soldier boys

So pick me up and hold me one more time
That's just consolation for this heart of mine
Whisper a sweet word to the one who loves you
So then wind me up let me go
Then wind me up let me go
Let me go
Let me go
