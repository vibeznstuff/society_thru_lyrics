Let's just take our time 
Theres nothing else to do 
What better way to spend the night 
Wasting it with you 
The moon has won the war 
The daylight waits to win 
Stay here by my side 
We'll watch the struggle start again 

I need you 
Now and forever 
To stay right here with me 
Don't ever leave 
Love was kept 
From me like a secret 
And I swore I was through 
Until you 
Until you 

The city's settled down 
I watch you as you sleep 
There's a silent celebration 
For every breath you breathe 
All this now makes sense 
With you as company 
I left all I knew and found 
The better part of me 
Yeah yeah 

I need you 
Now and forever 
To stay right here with me 
Don't ever leave 
Love was kept 
From me like a secret 
And I swore I was through 
Until you 
Until you 

The time it took to find you 
I would wait again, my baby 
For the feelings that I feel with you now 

I need you 
Now and forever 
To stay right here with me 
Don't ever leave 
Love was kept 
From me like a secret 
And I swore I was through 
Until you 
Until you 
Until you 
Until you
