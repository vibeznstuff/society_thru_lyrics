 "I have a grandfather on my father’s side. He’s 95 years old. His great grandfather came from Nigeria, from the Ebo tribe. I don’t look like my mother and I don’t look like my father. I look exactly like my grandfather. I act like him."
 "Do you act all the time?"
 "Not all the time. No."

You work all day and men who know
The wheels must turn to keep the flow
Oh, oh, oh

Build on up, don't break the chain,
Sparks will fly when the whistle blows

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, slave to the rhythm
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, slave to the rhythm

Work to the rhythm! Mm-hm.

Build on up, don't break the chain,
Sparks will fly when the whistle blows
Fire burns, hearts beat strong
Sing out loud, the chain gang song

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, slave to the rhythm
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, slave to the rhythm

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, slave to the rhythm
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, slave to the rhythm

Never stop the action
Oh, never stop the action
Never stop the action 
Keep it up, keep it up
Never stop the action

Aaaaaooowww!



Slave to the rhythm!
Keep it up, keep it up!
Never stop! Never stop!
Keep it up!

Work to the rhythm!
Slave to the rhythm! A-ha.
Live to the rhythm!
Love to the rhythm! A-ha.
