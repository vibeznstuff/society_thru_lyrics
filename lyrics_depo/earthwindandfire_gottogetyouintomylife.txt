I was alone, I took a ride, I didn't know what I would find there.
Another road, where maybe I could see another kind of mind there.
Ooh, then I suddenly see you.
Oooh, did I tell you I need you ev'ry single day of my life?

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

You didn't run, wyou didn't lie, you knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again for I had told you.
Ooh, you were meant to be near me.
Ooh, and I want you to hear me say we'll be together ev'ry day.

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be, when I'm with you I want to stay there.
If I'm true I'll never leave and if I do I know the way there.
Ooh, then I suddenly see you.
Ooh, did I tell you I need you ev'ry single day of my life?

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life
