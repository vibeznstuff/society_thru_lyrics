Anyone who's played on a record date
Will remember Stage Door Jenny
Well, I saw her last night and man
She looked like she wasn't gettin' any (Ahh)
Rock and roll kinda took its toll
When she shed her inhibitions
Too many scenes in limousines
And dressing room intermissions

She was the queen of 1964
But the truth of the matter is
Nobody wants her anymore
There was a time she could've shown you how
But nobody wants an overage groupie now

When it came to a superstar
Jenny was a braggart
Spread it all around to everyone in town
That she once had Mick Jagger (Ooh)
There's no doubt when the truth comes out
True love will over conquer
She didn't get Mick but she got a kick
And a black eye from Bianca

She was the queen of 1964
What a pity she became a shadow of
The girl she was before
She passed her prime, it seems a shame somehow
But nobody wants an overage groupie now

De-da-da-da-da-de-da-da
De-da-da-da-da
De-da-da-da-da-de-da-da
De-da-da-da-da
De-da-da-da-da-de-da-da
De-da-da-da-da
De-da-da-da-da-de-da-da
De-da-da-da-da

I'm afraid that the Morning Trade
Had a sad obiturary
There'll be no more Jenny at the door
They took her to the cemetery (Ahh)
Just an autograph book and a stereo
There was no one she was close ta
She was found with her arms around
An Elvis Presley poster

She was the queen of 1964
Tonight there'll be a moment of silence
At the Troubadour
There was a time she could've shown you how
But nobody wants an overage groupie now
But nobody wants an overage groupie now
