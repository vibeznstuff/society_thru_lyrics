There's an empty front porch rocking chair, and a rusty old tin roof.
A lonely silence fills the air, but I can still feel you.
Cars and trucks all slow down just to stare at me.
I'll smile and wave because I know they don't see
This whole town must think I'm crazy.

'Cause I can feel you all on my skin.
But to them, it's only the wind.
And I can feel the warmth of your touch, but to them it's just another noon day sun.
I know how bad you want to be here now, when I look up and see those tear drops coming down.
I look around and think "what a shame, they think it's just the rain".

I can hear you whisper when the leaves fall to the ground.
I can see you smiling through a rainbow in the clouds.
How someone could be so close and still so far away.
Guess they'll never understand and I just can't explain.

Yeah I know it sounds insane.

But I can feel you all on my skin.
But to them, it's only the wind.
And I can feel the warmth of your touch, but to them it's just another noon day sun.
I know how bad you want to be here now, when I look up and those tear drops coming down.
I look around and think "what a shame, they think it's just the rain".

I swear it's almost like you never went anywhere.

I know how bad you want to be here now, when I look up and see those tear drops falling down.
I still look around, think "what a shame, they think it's just the rain".
