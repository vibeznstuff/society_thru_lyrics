A new beginning 
A new chapter of my life 
Started the day 
When I thought 
It could be my last 
My eyes were wide shut but I hadn't given up 
Just thought I'd be walking the world alone 

Out of the blue 
There I met you 
Showed me a life I can't see without you 
And theres just no way 
That I can fight these emotions 
Your energy running through me 
Nobody can renew me like you 

Out of the blue 
Can this be true?

Family and friends they were my life 
I wasn't one for butterflies 
But you gave me love that I can't disguise 
And there will be times when we're apart 
I want you to know you're in my heart 
Growing into a beautiful garden 

No emotions 
My whole body felt like ice 
Needed to feel that the sun would shine my way 
My world had turned to dust 
But I had my faith and trust 
Just thought I'd be walking the world alone

Family and friends they were my life 
I wasn't one for butterflies 
But you gave me love that I can't disguise 
And there will be times when we're apart 
I want you to know you're in my heart 
Growing into a beautiful garden

Out of the blue 
There I met you 
I canâ€™t believe that this happened so soon 
And theres just no way 
That I can fight these emotions 
Your energy running through me 
(Out of the blue)
(There I met you)
(Showed me a life) I can't see without you
(Out of the blue) Without you
There I met you, you
(Showed me a life) I can't see without you

There will be times when we're apart 
I want you to know you're in my heart 
Growing into a beautiful garden (Finally come true)
(Out of the blue)
(There I met you)
