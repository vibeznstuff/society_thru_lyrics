Ooh babe, oh girl
No more, no more
Bounce baby, bounce baby
You can move, uh
Check it out

Baby, relax, sit back and chill (yeah)
Just give me a second
And let me tell you how I feel
Cause all around town you've been steppin' out
Runnin' your mouth about
What made you think I wouldn't find out?
Wasn't I there for you?
Truly cared for you
Maybe my love was just too good
Could've had it good
Now the love is gone
Cause he hit from the


Does he lace you with the finer things?
Does he make ya wanna scream his name?
Does he hit it from the front to back?
Did you let him break it down like that?
Should've told me the love was gone
Never thought that you'd do me wrong
Girl I though that your love was strong
Till I saw you with another man


No more shopping sprees
No more late night creeps
No more VIP's
No more dough
We can't even kick it no more



I saw you on the Av and in a Nav
In the backseat piece spilling Henney in his lap
Thought it was me you was all about
But I'm having doubts
Cause I see you try-na play me out
But when the brother called the crib with beef
Didn't I represent you?
When I caught him in the streets
So let me get the keys to Lex and then my checks
And no more hanging brigets around your neck, babe





No more, I want no more
Baby, I want no more
