She's the kinda girl boys read about in magazines, glossy magazines 
She is the only one I think about leading lady in my dreams 
Hey I have waited so long, to gather up my courage she has got me love drunk fumbling my words 
Times running out, gotta do it now 
She's the one I cannot live without 

Yeah.. she's the one I cannot live without 
Yeah.. yeah.. yeah.. yeah 

You only get one shot so make it count 
You might never get this moment again 
The clock is ticking down, it's the final round 
So tell me what it is thats stopping you now 
You never know unless you try 
You'll only regret sitting wondering why 
You only get one shot so watch this moment go by 
when love's on the line 

I never thought that I would get the chance to tell this girl how I feel, tell her how I feel 
Sometimes I pinch myself a mile away, this can't be real, this can't be real 
Move faster can't wait any longer, gotta do something before she gets away 
Do it like a movie, take her by the hand, I'm gonna love this girl until the end 

You only get one shot so make it count 
You might never get this moment again 
The clock is ticking down, it's the final round 
So tell me what it is thats stopping you now 
You never know unless you try 
You'll only regret sitting wondering why 
You only get one shot so watch this moment go by when love's on the line 

When love's on the line 

When love's on the line 

She is the definition of beautiful she knocks me off my feet 
I'mma tell her she's my everything, tell her that she's all I need, that I know she's the only reason my heart beats 
Da da da.. Da da da 

You might never get this moment again 
(You might never get this moment again ) 
You only get one shot so make it count 
You might never get this moment again (never get this moment again) 
The clock is ticking down, it's the final round 
So tell me what it is thats stopping you now 
You never know (never know) unless you try (unless you try) 
You'll only regret sitting wondering why (wondering why) 
You only get one shot so watch this moment go by 
when love's on the line 

When love is on the line, when love is on the line, when love is one the line 

When love's on the line (I wish I had one more chance, I wish I had one more chance) 

When love's on the line.
