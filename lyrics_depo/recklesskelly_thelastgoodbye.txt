The last goodbye really had me going
Pulling my strings all the while knowing
You weren't leaving anytime soon

The last goodbye really had me runnin' hot
You turned me into something I was not
You were determined to make me your fool

This time around I won't come running
No matter how hard you try
This time around I won't come crawling back to you
This is the last goodbye

The last goodbye was tougher than the one before
Hard to believe you could hurt me any more
But you did it, here we go again

The last goodbye was nothing but a toy
You were crying wolf like the lonesome little boy in the story
But here's how it ends

This time around I won't come running
No matter how hard you try
This time around I won't come crawling back to you
This is the last goodbye
This is the last goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
