Girl we get on like a house on fire,
You're feeding the flames I can't complain,
Choose your life it's an innocent lie,
Against the grain it's all the same

Spend my time wasting yours,
To give away you've got it all,
Apend your time wasting mine,
No...

Times for wasting celebrating.

What do you know learn to say no,
I can't resist,
I'm an optimist.

I spend my time wasting yours,
To give away you've got it all,
Spend your time wasting mine,
No...

Innocence
Inner sense
Times for wasting celebrating
