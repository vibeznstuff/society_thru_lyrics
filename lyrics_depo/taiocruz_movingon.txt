I cant wait till you're gone away, cos
then I can move on
I cant wait till you're gone away, cos
then I can move on
And I can say
I'm finally over you ...I'm 
It's finally over,
I can't wait till you're gone away, cos
then I can move on,
I can't wait till you are gone,
I can't wait till you are gone

You say that you are no longer in love
with me, and
You cannot be, the one for me,
Told me that this love of ours has taken

And its caused us to grow, apart and so

Girl don't say to me, you wanna be,
Be good friends with me, That's just

Goodbye to me
You should know girl that I...



I just need you to leave me lady
I just need you to leave me lady
That way I can move on you feel me
That way I can move on you feel me
I just need you to leave me lady
I just need you to leave me lady
That way I can move on you feel me
That way I can move on... feel me
I just need you to leave me lady
I just need you to leave me lady
That way I can move on you feel me
That way I can move on you feel me
I just need you to leave me lady
I just need you to leave me lady
That way I can move on you feel me
That way I can move on...
And I can say
I'm finally over you ...I'm 
It's finally over,
I can't wait till you're gone away, cos
then I can move on,
I can't wait till you are gone,
I can't wait till you are gone
