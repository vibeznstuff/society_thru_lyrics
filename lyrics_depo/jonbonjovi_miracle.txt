A penny for your thoughts now baby 
Looks like the weight of the world's on your shoulders now 
I know you think you're going crazy 
Just when it seems everything's gonna work itself out 
They drive you right back down 

And you said it ain't fair 
That a man walks 
When a bird can fly 
We have to kick the ground 
The stars kiss the sky 
They say that spirits live 
A man has to die 
They promised us truth 
Now they're giving us lies 

Gonna take a miracle top save us this time (ooh...) 
And your savior has just left town 
Gonna need a miracle 'cause it's all on the line 
And I won't let you down 
(No I won't let you down, ooh...) 
The river of your hope is flooding 
And I know the dam is busted 
If you need me I'll come running 
I won't let you down... no, no 

You're looking for salvation 
You thought that it'd be shining like an angel's light, yeah 
Well, the angels left this nation 
And salvation caught the last train out tonight 
He lost a hell of a fight 

He said: "I'm just one man, that's all I'll ever be 
I never can be everything you wanted from me 
I've got big plans so big that any blind man could see 
I'm standing in the river 
Now I'm drowning in the sea 

Gonna take a miracle top save us this time (ooh...) 
And your savior has just left town 
Gonna need a miracle 'cause your heart's on the line 
And your heartbeat is slowing down (heartbeat's blowing, ooh...) 
Your feet are grounded still you're reaching for the sky 
You can let 'em clip your wings 'cause I believe that you can fly 



Well my eyes have seen the horror of the coming of the flood 
I've driven deep the thorny crown into the soul of someone's son 
Still I'll look you in the eye 'cause I've believed in things I've thought 
And I'll die without regret for the wars I have fought 

Gonna take a miracle top save you this time (ooh...) 
And your savior has just left town 
Gonna need a miracle 'cause your heart's doing time 
And your conscience is calling you out (conscience's calling, ooh...) 
It ain't all for nothing 
Life ain't written in the sand 
I know the tide is coming 
But it's time we made a stand with a miracle 

Gonna take a miracle, I need a miracle 
I need a miracle, I need a miracle 
Na, miracle (miracle) oh...
