and I'm a black rainbow
and I'm an ape of god
I got a face that's made for doing violence upon
I'm a teen distortion
survived abortion
a rebel from the waist down

I wanna thank you mom 
I wanna thank you dad
for bringing this fucking world
to a bitter end
I never really hated a one true god
but the god of the people I hated

you said you wanted evolution
the ape was a great big hit
you say you want a revolution, man
and I say that you're full of shit

we're disposable teens
we're disposable teens
we're disposable teens
we're disposable

we're disposable teens
we're disposable teens
we're disposable teens
we're disposable

you said you wanted evolution
the ape was a great big hit
you say you want a revolution, man
and I say that you're full of shit

The more that you fear us
the bigger we get
the more that you fear us
the bigger we get
and don't be surprised, don't be surprised
don't be surprised when we destroy all of it
