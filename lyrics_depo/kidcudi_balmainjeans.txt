Help me take off my Balmain jeans
I'll undo yours
You can lick it after I'm done lickin' you first
I wanna taste it
Tired of waitin'
Are you tasty?

Yahm yahm
Come on baby
Yahm

Hope you can feel that vibe
The vibes of the night
Your body is warm
In my arms
We're under the stars

Can I come inside your vortex
Can I come inside your vortex
Let me baby


It's been so long, been such a hobby
Finding someone who electrifies my body
I need you to protect my heart
Gimme your hand, put it here
This is where you start

Keep feelin' on me
(Don't stop)
Keep feelin' on me

Keep feelin' on me
(Don't stop)
Keep feelin' on me


Lord help me
Lord help me
I got a lover under my covers
I don't want her to leave
She says I'm perfect
Perfectly kissing on my neck
She is the sexiest
She said she loves my scent

Hope you can feel that vibe
The vibes in the night
Her body is warm
In my arms
We're under the stars

I wanna taste it
Tired of waitin'
Are you tasty?

Yahm yahm
Come on baby
Yahm


It's been so long, been such a hobby
Finding someone who electrifies my body

Gimme your hand, put it here

Keep feelin' on me

Oh girl you're so sweet to me
I love it when you're zoomin'
Oh girl you're so sweet to me
