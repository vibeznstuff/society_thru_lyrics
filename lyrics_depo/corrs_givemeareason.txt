Give me a reason... (Give me a reason... Give me a reason...)

It's not romantic here in blue
Swimming, swimming in blue
You left me lonely and confused
Question, questioning you
So soon goodbye you stole my heart
I'm believing you
Was it a lie right from the start
Answer, answer me do...

Well now my body's weak - so just give me a reason
And my make-up's off - so just give me a reason
And my defense's down - so just give me a reason
Give me a reason
Give me a reason

You'll never know the love I felt
Waiting, waiting for you
It takes a weak heart to forget
Follow, follow it through

Well now my body's weak - so just give me a reason
And my make-up's off - so just give me a reason
And my defense's down - so just give me a reason
Give me a reason
Give me a reason
Give me a reason...



So what's a girl like me to do
Drowning, drowning in you
And who's to save me from the blue
Carry, carry me through

Cause now my body's weak - so just give me a reason
And my make-up's off - so just give me a reason
And my defense's down - so just give me a reason
I am strong enough - so just give me a reason
Now my body's weak - so just give me a reason
And my make-up's off - so just give me a reason
My defense's down - so just give me a reason
Give me a reason
Give me a reason
Give me a reason
Give me a reason
Give me a reason
What did I do wrong...
