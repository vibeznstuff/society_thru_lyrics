I really should be saying goodnight
I really shouldn't stay anymore
It's been so long since I held you
I've forgotten what love is for

I should run on the double
I think I'm in trouble
I think I'm in trouble

So come to me darling and hold me
Let your honey keep you warm
It's been so long since I held you
I've forgotten what love is for

I should run on the double
I think I'm in trouble
I think I'm in trouble
