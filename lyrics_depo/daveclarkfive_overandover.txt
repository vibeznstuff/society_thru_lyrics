Well, I went to a dance just the other night
Everybody there was stag
I said over and over and over again
This dance is gonna be a drag

I said over and over and over again
This dance is gonna be a drag
I said over and over and over again
This dance is gonna be a drag

All at once it happened
The prettiest in the world
I said a-won't you come over and a-talk to me
And be my girl

I said a-won't you come over and a-talk to me
And be my girl
I said a-won't you come over and a-talk to me
And be my girl

She said she was sorry
And I was a little bit late
She would a-wait and a-wait and a-wait and a-wait
For her steady date

She would a-wait and a-wait and a-wait and a-wait
For her steady date
She would a-wait and a-wait and a-wait and a-wait
For her steady date
