Shoot the runner 
Shoot shoot the runner 
I'm a king and she's my queen 

Shoot the runner

Dream 
Dream again in your way 
Always knew that you would 
Loose yourself to the scene 
Am I only a dream 

Shoot the runner

I'm a king and she's my queen, Bitch 

Bang 
Bang away with my Chang 
Always know that I can 
Get your knee's on the floor 
Absinth make you may whore 

Shoot the runner

I'm a king and she's my queen

I'm a king and she's my queen, Bitch 

Kings 
Kings may come and then go 
By this sword you must know 
That all things will come and then pass 
Live your days like the last
