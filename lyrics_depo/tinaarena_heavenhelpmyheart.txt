Two smiling faces
That's how it used to be
What once was forever
Now a faded memory
The perfect illusion
For a while I guess it was
Without explanation the bloom fell off the rose
Heaven help my heart
'Cause it's a lot like me
Wondering when this all will end and I find the love I need
I know it's out there somewhere
Somehow I still believe
I'm asking please
Heaven help my heart

This world can get crazy
These are troubled times
I'd walk through fire if love is what I'd find
It's out of my hands so I put my faith in you
I say a little prayer and hope that it comes true
Heaven help my heart
'Cause it's a lot like me
Wondering when this all will end and I find the love I need
I know it's out there somewhere
Somehow I still believe
I'm asking please
Heaven help my heart
