It's hot up in the west end, there's panic right downtown
As the gangs assemble, coming up from underground
Well Jesus I don't know which side I should be on
I'm a class contender if anything goes wrong

 When it's time to rock
We're the only ones
No one takes this block
'Cos we're number one

We sneaked through the no go, very late last night
Out up from the back streets, cruising for a fight
Well Jackie's got his six string, he can play behind his back
Mickey's out from Bellevue, he's just makin' tracks





As we rocked through the midnight, took 'em all by storm
The police boys didn't have a chance, didn't even get warm
Oh Daddy, why am I sittin' here,I'm not a member of the bar
I'm not the only wild one in a hot wired car
