I was walking down the street
Just the other day
I caught a glimpse
Of life vivid reality
I saw a man on the street
Had no clothes or shoes
These are signs of the times
That's what they say

Everybody better
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
To your heart

The prophets of the times
Are written on street car walls
Can't you see them crying
Can't you hear them call

Mother mother children still
Got to grow
Father father where do we go

Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
To your heart

Space age assures us life will
Go on
And everybody trying to believe
Forget the future
Think about right now

Somehow seem to be growing
Theme
Prophets of the times
Are written on street car walls
Can't you see them crying
Can't you hear them calling
Mother mother children still have
To grow
Father father where do we go

Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
To your heart

Space age assures us life will
Go on
Everybody trying to believe
Forget the future
Think about right now

Everybody better
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
To your heart

Forget the future
Think about right now

Everybody better
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
To your heart

Everybody better
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
To your heart

Everybody better
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
To your heart
