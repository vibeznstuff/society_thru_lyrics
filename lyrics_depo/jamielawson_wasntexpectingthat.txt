It was only a smile
But my heart it went wild
I wasn't expecting that 
Just a delicate kiss
Anyone could've missed 
I wasn't expecting that 

Did I misread the sign?
Your hand slipped into mine 
I wasn't expecting that 
You spent the night in my bed
You woke up and you said 
"Well, I wasn't expecting that!" 

I thought love wasn't meant to last
I thought you were just passing through 
If I ever get the nerve to ask 
What did I get right to deserve somebody like you? 
I wasn't expecting that 

It was only a word
It was almost misheard 
I wasn't expecting that 
But it came without fear
A month turned into a year 
I wasn't expecting that 

I thought love wasn't meant to last
Honey, I thought you were just passing through 
If I ever get the nerve to ask 
What did I get right to deserve somebody like you? 
I wasn't expecting that 

Oh and isn't it strange
How a life can be changed
In the flicker of the sweetest smile
We were married in spring
You know I wouldn't change a thing
Without that innocent kiss
What a life I'd have missed

If you'd not took a chance
On a little romance
When I wasn't expecting that
Time doesn't take long
Three kids up and gone
I wasn't expecting that

When the nurses they came
Said, "It's come back again"
I wasn't expecting that
Then you closed your eyes
You took my heart by surprise 
I wasn't expecting that
