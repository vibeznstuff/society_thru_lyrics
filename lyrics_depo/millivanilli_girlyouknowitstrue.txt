So what are you doing back?

Well, I set back and thought about
The things we used to do
It really meant a lot to me
You mean a lot to me

I really mean that much to you?

Girl, you know it's true

I'm in love with you, girl, 'cause you're on my mind
You're the one I think about most every time
And when you pack a smile in everything you do
Don't you understand, girl, this love is true?
You're soft, succulent, so sweet and thin
That's kind of like a vision upon your skin
It lightens up my day, and that's, oh, so true
Together we're one, separated we're two
To make you all mine, all mine is my desire
'Cause you contain a quality, you that I admire
You're pretty plain and simple, you rule my world
So try to understand
I'm in love, girl, I'm so in love, girl
I'm just in love, girl, and this is true

Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you

This is some sort of thing, girl, I can't explain
My emotions starts up when I hear your name
Maybe your sweet, sweet voice would ring in my ears
It stimulate my senses, girl, when you are near
And with your positive emotion, love-making enjoyin'
That's for me to bust, it's like a girl and a boy
These feelings I get I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I
Now what you're wearing I don't care, or as I've said before
No reason that I like you, girl, just for what you are
If I said I'd think about it, you rule my world
So try to understand
I'm in love, girl, I'm so in love, girl
I'm just in love girl, and this is true

Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
My love
Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
