Yeah, Yeah Sway has arrived
Keeping you up through the day and the night
Some wanna be ballers, some wanna be G's
Saturday night fever we're staying alive
It's the day in the life, Roaming the streets
Hands in the air if you know you're a (beast)
Let them phone the Police, we never hide
Divisions but we never came here to fight
Better press to top 5 there ain't no challenge
(I just can't get no sleep)
We practise and train in a place where there ain't no cameras
(I just can't get no sleep)
You better get ready like a sub when the bass goes bang
(I just can't get no sleep)
We climb up tables and we don't even take no ladders,
They be looking like where's your table manners?
Let's Go


(Let's Go)
I went to the mountains
(Da, Da, Da, Da, Da, Da)
Fell in love with the peace
(Da, Da, Da, Da, Da, Da)
But no matter how hard I try
(How hard I try)
Just can't get no sleep
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I said I just can't get no sleep
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I said I just can't get no sleep
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I said I just can't get no
Just can't get no
Just can't get no sleep


(Haha, yeah it's your boy Ksiolajidebt)
(Let's do this!)
KS-I, yes
I'm an all nighter
I don't like rest
Nothing on me at my best
Selena Gomez she got a nice...
(Next)
Twenty-Four-Seven I aim for the heavens
Even when now I was eleven
Heaven was finding the seven
Minutes alone in my bedroom
(UGHHH)
Hear that sound
Heartbeat beating
Going so fast you can see that I'm beasting
No sleep, no sleep, no sleep
You won't see any cause I ate my sheep
Let's get Messi like Lionel
Get hyper as a mosher's pit
I'm on this
NO one can stop me
Out of my way let me finish this properly




No sleep
Deep breath, here it goes
It's Super Swah...
On top of the mountain, no it never gets lonely when you're going for the cup
And getting them round in with the whole team, no stopping until we're holding a trophy
(Woah, woah, woah Sway mate, Sway mate, you've got to go a bit more slowly)
Alright Tubes, you show me, but you got one bar and one bar only
Some dose off on the way to the top
(Oh my gosh Sway, wait for the drop, drop, drop, drop)


(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I said I just can't get no sleep
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I said I just can't get no sleep
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I said I just can't get no
Just can't get no
Just can't get no sleep
