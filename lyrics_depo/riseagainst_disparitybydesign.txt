All the way at the bottom
Of the barrels we cry out
So ashamed of our tears that
We blame only ourselves
That's when they win
They keep us convinced
To lift up our chins
These playing fields are level
We all have a chance
With that they dismiss
The fast lanes they rode
In which access depends
On who you know
Or where you came from
Whose daughter are you?
Whose fortunate son?
We're told
To stick out our thumbs
They feast from the linens
While we settle for crumbs

Is this an over-reaching arm?
Or is this compassion?
Is this a handout undeserved?
Or a just reparation?
(A just reparation)

All the way from the towers
High above glass ceilinged tombs
Tell themselves
That they've earned this
By working hard
And playing by the rules
But this is only part true
A dangerous trick
Played on me and you
And so like a practical joke
We pulled on these bootstraps
So hard that they broke

Is this an over-reaching arm?
Or is this compassion?
Is this a handout undeserved?
Or a just reparation?
And like a single domino
That falls while the rest stay vertical
We're fed these empty fairytales
Oh will you believe them?

And if there's a God
You better pray
That this sleeping giant never wakes

If we just took a step back
A bigger picture we might view
Perhaps the man in the gutter
Is not so different from you

Come in, out of the cold
Forget all that you know
Because there's always been room
By the fire for you, oh
Come in, out of the cold

Will you believe them?
Is this an over-reaching arm?
Or is this compassion?
Is this a handout undeserved
Or a just reparation?
And like a single domino
That falls while the rest stay vertical
We're fed these empty fairy tales
And I'm through believing
