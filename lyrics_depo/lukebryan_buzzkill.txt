You're like a screen flashin', insufficient funds,
Cops knockin' when the party's just begun. 
You're a big rain cloud parked over my boat. 
You're a cell phone splashin' in my coffee cup, 
A fumble on the one when my team was going up,
You're like brakes on my brain and all I know,


You're a buzzkill, every time you come around.
Those beers might as well have been poured out.
Why are you still showin' up and bringin' me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me,
and mess up what this night was gonna be?
You walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will, 
you little buzzkill.
Baby, you're a buzzkill.

I used to do everything I could do to do nice things,
No matter what I did or didn't do it didn't change. 
Everybody knows you ended us.
So why you showing up here on my side of the tracks?
Slipping in this bar just to check out where I'm at,
I was a six pack in, now I'm as sober as a judge, cause


You're a buzzkill, every time you come around.
Those beers might as well have been poured out.
Why are you still showin' up and bringin' me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me,
and mess up what this night was gonna be?
You walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will, 
you little buzzkill.

As if it didn't hurt enough, Now I gotta see you flirt.
Nailed to the stool, watching you work,
Don't you give a damn about how I feel,You little brown haired, blue eyed, beautiful buzzkill.
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're such a buzzkill.


Yeah, You're a buzzkill, every time you come around.
Those beers might as well have been poured out.
Why are you still showin' up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me,
and mess up what this night was gonna be?
You walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will, 
you little buzzkill.
You little buzzkill.
