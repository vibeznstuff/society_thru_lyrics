Pray to they future
Look to the past
Face the accuser
Freeze in our tracks
When so many children
Have fallen from grace
The doors should be open
No scorn or disgrace

Keys have been stolen
Treasure is lost
Lesson is golden
Hearts have been crossed
So here's to the heroes
Come one and come all
Without them, well, who knows?
Who knows at all?

In these days of no trust
Evermore hostility
We're all living
Under the same old sky
'Cause we're all living
We're telling the same old lie
In these days
In these days
In these days of no trust

And music recorded
Might influence dreams
But headlines are courted
By stretch limousines
Pictures of plenty
Stuck to the walls
For heads that are empty
Brains on the floor
Can't take any more, no

Someone is shouting
Revolution is here
But he'll climb any mountain
Fr his selfish career
The truth's not a curtain
To be drawn back and forth
It's a flame that keep burning
Everlasting torch

In these days of no trust
Evermore hostility
We're all living
Under the same old sky
'Cause we're all living
We're telling the same old lie
In these days
In these days
In these days of no trust

Evermore hostility
We're all living
Under the same old sky
'Cause we're all living
We're telling the same old lie
Everybody
In these days of no trust
In these days
In these days of no trust
