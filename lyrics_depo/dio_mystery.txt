Hey can you hear me can you see there's a storm on the edge of the sky
Does it matter it well does to me I can tell you why
You know when there's thunder there should be rain
But it don't always follow the rule no
And is the wise man always right no he can play the fool
It's always a mystery not what it seems to be
It's always a mystery just like you and me always a mystery
We are lightning we are flame and we burn at the touch of a spark
When there's the fire but no one sees the there's only the dark
Just imagine will you try I can see that you've opened your mind
Silver linings can disappear but they always shine
It's always a mystery not what it seems to be
It's always a mystery just like you and me always a mystery
It's always a mystery not what it seems to be always a mystery just like you and me 
It's always a mystery not what you want to see 
Always a mystery just like you and me always a mystery
Always a mystery not what you want to see always a mystery
