She said its not about you 
it's not about you, it's me 
She said it's not about you 
it's not about you, it's me 

And sometimes its good 
sometimes its bad 
but living with you, well it's driving me mad 
And sometimes its good 
sometimes its bad 
but living with you is, well it's becomming a drag 

She's a beautiful smile, she's a gleam in your eye 
dresses like a princess, playing games in your mind 
Falling out of her top, runs a hand through her hair 
playing so hard to get, cause she knows that you care 

I dont know how to love you more, how to love you more 
how to love you more, my friend 
I dont know how to love you more, how to love you more 
how to love you more, my.... 

I guess we got, i guess we got 
i guess we got nothing to say 
I guess we got, i guess we got 
i guess we got... 

It's not about you (don't you go) 
i guess we got 
It's not about you (don't you go) 
i guess we got 

And sometimes its good 
sometimes its bad 
but living with you, well it's driving me mad 
And sometimes its good 
sometimes its bad 
but living with you is, well it's making me sad 

So is this how it ends? Well nobody knows 
she'll be gone for a year and we'll see how it goes 
Moving out of your flat, slipping right through your hands 
she's a difficult girl and your a sillier man 

I dont know how to love you more, how to love you more 
how to love you more, my friend 
I dont know how to love you more, how to love you more 
how to love you more, my.... 

I dont know how to love you more, how to love you more 
how to love you more, my friend 
I dont know how to love you more, how to love you more 
how to love you more, my.... 

I guess we got, i guess we got 
i guess we got nothing to say 
I guess we got, i guess we got 
i guess we got... 

It's not about you (don't you go) 
i guess we got 
It's not about you (don't you go) 
i guess we got 

It's not about about you 
(don't you go home, don't you go home, don't you leave me here alone) 
(And sometimes its good 
sometimes its bad 
but living with you, well it's driving me mad 
And sometimes its good 
sometimes its bad 
but living with you is, well your driving me...) 

I don't know, i don't know, i don't know 
how to love you, but i love you so 
I don't know, i don't know, i don't know 
why i love you, but i love you so 

I don't know, i don't know, i don't know 
why i love you, but i love you so 
I don't know, i don't know, i don't know... 

I guess we got, i guess we got 
i guess we got nothing to say 
I guess we got, i guess we got 
i guess we got (nothing to say) 

It's not about about you 
(don't you go home, don't you go home, don't you leave me here alone) 
(And sometimes its good 
sometimes its bad 
but living with you, well it's driving me mad 
And sometimes its good 
sometimes its bad 
but living with you is, well your driving me...)
