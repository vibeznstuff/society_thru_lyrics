I found a switch
Turned it on
I hit the ditch
You carried on
I was so near
Now you're so far
Are you quite sure
Just who you are

O IIIII
O you could chose a friend but you don't seem to have the time
O IIIII
I wonder if you ever get to say what's on your mind
O take a little time, take a little time

I love it when you call
I love it when you call
I love it when you call
But you never call at all
So what's the complication it's only conversation
I love it when you call
But you never call at all

Remember me, I used to be the best time buddy
That you couldn't wait to see
But getting old, it takes its toll
And hearts getting broken lead to people growing cold

O IIIIII
I'm flipping with a  coin that's got a tail on either side
O IIIIII
I'm gonna be the one who makes you stop and realise
You could have it all
We should have it all

I love it when you call
I love it when you call
I love it when you call
But you never call at all
So what's the complication it's only conversation
I love it when you call
But you never call at all

Yea I wonder where you been
Yea I wonder who you seen
And I hope you find your train
When you do I really hope it's all it seems

I love it when you call
I love it when you call
I love it when you call
But you never call at all
So what's the complication it's only conversation
I love it when you call
But you never call at all
