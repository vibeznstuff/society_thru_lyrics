Wey-oh, wey-oh
We'll be as one in wonder, wonderland

Through my doubts 
Hold me high 
Through your strength 
Tears will dry 
Break these walls that divide 
Build a path, be my guide 

Gotta be a will, gotta be a way 
But only if we learn to give 
Spread a little love 'cos it's never too late 
People of the world 

Come together we can hold it in our hands 
A wonder, wonder, wonder, wonderland 
And forever united, we will stand 
In wonder, wonder, wonder, wonderland 
Wey-oh, wey-oh 
We'll be as one in wonder, wonderland 

(Like that, y'all, like that, yes) 

Sure as time (time) turns a page (page) 
Destiny (ooh) leads the way 
And breathe new life (life) 
Make a change (change) 
And together (ooh) we'll find our way 

Gotta be a time, gotta be a place 
We can bridge our lives as one 
Every ounce of love and hope embrace 
People of the world 

Come together we can hold it in our hands 
A wonder, wonder, wonder, wonderland 
And forever (and forever yeah) united we will stand 

In wonder, wonder, wonder, wonderland 
Wey-oh, wey-oh 
We'll be as one in wonder, wonderland 
Wey-oh, wey-oh 
In wonder, wonder, wonder, wonderland 

When we're blind, help us see 
We'll find peace and harmony 
When we're lost (when I'm lost) 
Take us home (take us home) 
To wonder, wonderland 

Come together we can hold it in our hands 
A wonder, wonder, wonder, wonderland 
And forever united, we will stand 
In wonder, wonder, wonder (ah yeah), wonderland 
Come together (come together, yeah) 
We can hold it in our hands 
A wonder, wonder, wonder (uh-oh), wonderland (oh, yeah) 
And forever (forever, yeah) united, we will stand 
In wonder, wonder, wonder, wonderland 
Wey-oh, wey-oh 
We'll be as one in wonder, wonderland (ah, yeah) 
Wey-oh (we should come together) 
Wey-oh (we'll be united forever) 
In wonder, wonder, wonder, wonderland 
Wey-oh, wey-oh 
We'll be as one in wonder, wonderland 
Wey-oh, wey-oh 
In wonder, won
