I feel the pain of everyone 
Then I feel nothing 
I feel the pain of everyone 
Then I feel nothing 

I feel the pain of everyone 
Then I feel nothing 
I feel the pain of everyone 
Then I feel nothing 

Is it up to me? 
You won't wait to see 
Screwed us both again 
About as close as you've been 

I feel the pain of everyone 
Then I feel nothing 
I feel the pain of everyone 
Then I feel nothing 

Is it up to me? 
You won't wait to see 
Screwed us yet again 
About as close as you've been 
Hey now, take it back 
Get off me, you're sad 
Trailin' on your scene 
Just try and keep it clean
