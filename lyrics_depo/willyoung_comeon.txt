Walk away
That’s what you do
And it looks like I’m
Somebody you, once knew
You’re caught in a corner
With nowhere to hide, you’re eyes
Do you think you wanna
Say goodbye


Hey 
Always the last to say
Everything makes you feel
Like a walking away
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Hey
Always the last to say
Everything makes you feel
Like a walking away
Come on, come on, come on, come on

There’s a bit of me
That will always be, with you
And something tells me
This is love due


Hey 
Always the last to say
Everything makes you feel
Like a walking away
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Hey
Always the last to say
Everything makes you feel
Like a walking away
Come on, come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

Like a dream
The sky is falling
Is it you who’s talking
Can I take these words away
Heyay


Hey 
Always the last to say
Everything makes you feel
Like a walking away
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Like a dream
The sky is falling
Is it you who’s talking
Can I take these words away
Like a dream
The sky is falling
Is it you who’s talking
Can I take these words away
