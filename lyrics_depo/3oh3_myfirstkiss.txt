My first kiss went a little like this
 and twist

Well my first kiss went a little like this
 and twist

I said no more teachers and no more books
I got a kiss under the bleachers hopin' that nobody looked
Lips like licorice, tongue like candy
Excuse me miss, but can I get you out your panties?

In the back of the car
On the way to the bar
I got you on my lips (I got you on my lips)
At the foot of the stairs
With my fingers in your hair, baby this is it...


She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooooooooooooooh
Ooooooooooooooh
She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooooooooooooooh
Ooooooooooooooh

 My first kiss went a little like this...

I said no more sailors and no more soldiers
With your name in a heart tattooed upon their shoulders
Kisses like whiskey, it gets me drunk
And I wake up in the morning with the taste of your tongue

In the back of the car
On the way to the bar
I got you on my lips (I got you on my lips)
At the foot of the stairs
With my fingers in your hair, baby this is it...


She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooooooooooooooh
Ooooooooooooooh
She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooooooooooooooh
Ooooooooooooooh

My first kiss went a little like this
 and twist
Well my first kiss went a little like this
 and twist

Yeah, she won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say...

Ooooooooooooooh


She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooooooooooooooh
Ooooooooooooooh
She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooooooooooooooh
Ooooooooooooooh

She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say...
