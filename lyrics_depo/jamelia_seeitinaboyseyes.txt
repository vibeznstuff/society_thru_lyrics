When it rains, well it rains
Oh my heart don't feel the same
Nothing change, nothing change
Comrade I don't feel the same
With my foot to the floor
Hear my key turn in the door
Holding back what's in store
When a girl wants a little bit more



What's a girl like me to do
When she don't get a thing from you
I wanna go where you're going to
Have to do what you have to do
What's a girl supposed to try
When all you do is criticise
Pretty soon you'll realise
I can see it, I can see it in a boy's eyes
see it in a boy's, see it in a boy's eyes 

Well it rains, when it rains
Oh my heart don't feel the same
There's a sun in my sky
You don't see it, you don't even try
But you'll die, before you cry
Solitude is where you fly
You don't say this ain't right
But I see it in your eyes

What's a girl like me to do
When she don't get a thing from you
I wanna go where you're going to
Have to do what you have to do
What's a girl supposed to try
When all you do is criticise
Pretty soon you'll realise
I can see it, I can see it in a boy's eyes
see it in a boy's, see it in a boy's eyes 

What's a girl like me to do
When she don't get a thing from you
I wanna know where you're going to
Have to do what you have to do
What's a girl supposed to say 
Just turn around and walk away
Pretty soon you'll realise I can see it
I can see it in a boy's eyes 
see it in a boy's, see it in a boy's eyes
