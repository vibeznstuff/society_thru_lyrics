Rush in 
Way too fast 
Why do I always do it?
Thinking this might last
How could I be so stupid?

But this time 
I'm not OK, no 
I need to breathe again
'Cause I don't want to

I don't want to make another mistake like you
And I don't want to hate, but love doesn't get me through
'Cause I can't be 
Alone again
No I don't want to make another mistake
Like you 

Stone cold 
And hurt inside
Not what I wanted to be
I don't sleep
Its kinda hard when you cry
Yeah that's where you left me

But this time 
It's not alright, no
I need to find someone
'Cause I don't want to

I don't want to make another mistake like you
And I don't want to hate, but love doesn't get me through
'Cause I can't be 
Alone again
No I don't want to make another mistake
Like you 

Don't wanna be caught in the moment it never comes
Is it too much to ask 
That real love could find me?
I won't get stung?
I'll find the one

but...

I don't want to make another mistake like you
And I don't want to hate, but love doesn't get me through
'Cause I can't be 
Alone again
No I don't want to make another mistake
Like you 

I don't want to make another mistake like you
And I dont want to hate, but love doesn't get me through 
'Cause I can't be 
Alone again
No I don't want to make another mistake...
