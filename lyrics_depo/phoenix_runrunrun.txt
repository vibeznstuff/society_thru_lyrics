Business calls me
Trouble down the waterfront
You know, I tried to
But now i'm running outta lies
It's a clear view
When all you are is gettin' paid
No more favors
I know what we can do about it

I think I'd better run, run, run, run
I think I'd better run, run, run, run
You didn't catch me fallin'
Fallin' fallin' fallin' fallin'
Fallin' fallin' fallin'

Contradictions
Get me everything i want
I'll let you know
But i think it's gonna take a while
It's a clear view
No one's waiting at the door
A million letters
They couldn't make me change my mind

I think I'd better run, run, run, run
I think I'd better run, run, run, run
You didn't catch me fallin'
Fallin' fallin' fallin' fallin'
Fallin' fallin' fallin'

How you want it to be
Sittin' by the waterfront
I should be drifting
Far enough to reach the shore
It's a clear view
Don't you underestimate me
No more flavors
I know I can live without it

I think I'd better run, run, run, run
I think I'd better run, run, run, run
You didn't catch me fallin'
Fallin' fallin' fallin' fallin'
Fallin' fallin' fallin'
(If you got to play the game
you got got to do it well)

I think i'd better run, run, run, run
And leave those things for someone else
But i like it
I don't even care
If you got to play the game
You got to do it well
