Now, I can't behave
I feel it in my feet on the streets
But don't you know?
There's something I can feel
When I breathe

I told you once
You're breaking into separate parts
But don't you know?
It's something that I can't live without

And if somebody's going to make it
Then this somebody ought to be you
And I keep telling my reflection
Ambitions are already starting to fade

I can't tolerate
The feelings that I feel when I feel
But don't you know?
Some feelings never seem to let go

Like a silver blade
I cut my way out of control
But don't you know?
Some blades will cut you right to the bone

And if somebody's going to make it
Then this somebody ought to be you
And if somebody's going to fake it
Then this somebody, somebody is you
If it's me that was going to take it
Then I know that it wouldn't be straight
And I keep telling me reflection
Ambitions are already starting to fade

I can't tolerate...
I can't tolerate...

And if somebody's going to make it
Then this somebody ought to be you
And if somebody's going to fake it
Then this somebody, somebody is you
If it's me that was going to take it
Then I know that it wouldn't be straight
And I keep telling my reflection
Ambitions are already starting to fade
