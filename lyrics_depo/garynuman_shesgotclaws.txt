You are distraction
Like pictures on the wall
I don't like eyes
You are attraction
It gets to be routine
You're up I'm down

She's got claws
But the factory knows
We're dreams in cold storage
We could dance the night away

You say you love me
Maybe you do
A patience I can't steal
I don't believe you
You said 'straight'
It's like giving up hope

Here on the ground
On the floor
Screaming nothing at all
Here on the ground
Like some whore
Looking down on you all
Too much advice. I'm not sure.

Laughing hyenas
With pens for charms
You'll just suck in the boys
We have to leave soon
Shut the door
This house is far too cold

She's got claws
But the factory knows
We're dreams in cold storage
We could dance the night away
