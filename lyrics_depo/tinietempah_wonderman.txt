The strong, the mighty!
The forces of evil can never destroy,
The powers of the Wonderman,
And though the most formidable journey lies ahead,
Only one will prevail.
Wonder,
WONDER!
WONDERMAN!


Uh, yeh, these haters couldn’t get to where I am with a full tank of petrol,
Uh, my uncle used to drink a can of Kestrel when life got stressful,
Uh, what kinda person should you be when you wanna make people accept you?
Uh, what does it really mean when you dream of being famous and successful?
When you were born to be special?

Uh, yeh, and I went from the kid in class,
Textin’ radio DJs so they could big me up,
To the young rapper everybody’s ringing up,
Got ‘em looking for a sprinkle of that pixie dust,
Mad thoughts in my head when it’s blowin’ up,
Like, are you really big enough?
I traded friends for fans,
Cement for sand,
Raise your hand,
The Wonderman.


I see the bright lights shine in your face,
We’re counting on you to take it all away,
I saw the chosen one,
They’re calling your name,
Are you, you?
Are you, you?
The Wonderman?


Bored of being nameless,
Bored of feeling local,
When you walk up in the mall and can’t afford a pair of trainers,
Imagine when it changes,
Imagine satisfaction when you make it,
It’s more than being famous,
More then the applause and more than any form of status,
More than the performances in 20 foreign places,
Benidorm, Vegas, many more praises,

Amen, hallelujah! Tinie look what’s happened to ya,
Yeah they love that attitude,
Brand new and improved, yeah.
And when the fans start grabbing you,
Show gratitude with a little braggin’ too,

Amen, hallelujah! Tinie look what’s happened to ya,
Who can say they ran all the obstacles I ran? Look,
I traded friends for fans,
Cement from sand,
Raise your hand,
The Wonderman


I see the bright lights shine in your face,
We’re counting on you to take it all away,
I saw the chosen one,
They’re calling your name,
Are you, you?
Are you, you?
The Wonderman?

Come on, come on,
The stars are where you belong,
Come on, follow,
Your heart is gunna take you home,
Come on, come on,
The stars are where you belong,
There’s no turning back from here.


I see the bright lights shine in your face,
We’re counting on you to take it all away,
I saw the chosen one,
They’re calling your name,
Are you, you?
Are you, you?
The Wonderman?

(From this day on, the world will never be the same)
