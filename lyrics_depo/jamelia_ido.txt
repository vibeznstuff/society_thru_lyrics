Mmmm, Ummm, Mmmm

I've Been Around But Never Found
Someone That Compares To You My Friend
But How Can I Tell You
That Everytime You Cross My Mind
Its Time That You Knew
I Wish That I Could Be The One For You

(But If I Showed You)
(Wonder What You'd Do)
How I Really Feel Inside
Would You Run Away And Hide?
(And If I Told You)
What My Heart Is Telling Me
I Do (I Do)
Would You Tell Me, You Feel The Same Way That I

If You Were Mine, I'd Think You'd Find
That Nobody Compares To Me My Friend
Then Why Can't You See Yeah
Coz I Don't Wanna Loose You
I Try To Show You, But I Don't Wanna Push You

(But If I Showed You)
(Wonder What You'd Do)
How I Really Feel Inside
Would You Run Away And Hide?
(And If I Told You)
What My Heart Is Telling Me
Would You Tell Me, You Feel The Same Way That I
I Do (I Do)

(But If I Showed You)
How I Really Feel Inside
(Wonder What You'd Do)
Would You Run Away And Hide?
(And If I Told You)
I Do (I Do) (You)
What My Heart Is Telling Me Would You Tell Me, You Feel The Same Way That I

Know That Im Waiting Baby
You (Know That Im Waiting)
All This Time That You Were Wasting Yeah
Waiting For You To Let Me Know
Yeah (All This Time That You Were Wasting)
It Could Be, You And Me I Am All You Need Baby,
Tell Me,

Coz You Want Me, Like I Want You
If You Want Me,
I Want You, Yes I Do
I, I, I, I Want It This Time

(But If I Showed You)
(Wonder What You'd Do)
Show'd You That I Feel You Baby
(And If I Told You)
What Would You Do? What Would You Do?
That I Want You, Oh Ouh I Want You

Would You Tell Me, You Feel The Same Way That I
I Do (I Do)
(But If I Showed You)
Tell Me How You Feel
(Wonder What You'd Do)
Now What Would You Do? What Would You Do?
(And If I Told You)
How Im Feeling Would You Tell Me (Tell Me),
You Feel The Same Way (Oh Yeah) That I,
I Do
