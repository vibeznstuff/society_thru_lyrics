When you love someone it's natural, not demanding
And that's one thing I'm proud to say I found in you
I'm so glad we reached an understanding
Now I know my heart is safe with you, hoo...
So now my love to you, baby, I surrender

Get ready tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready (Oh, baby) tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember

Celebrations and my heart could stay united
And there's nothing in this world to come between me and you
We're together and it keeps me so excited
To think of what the power of love can do, ooh...
And I'm filled with a love that's, oh, so tender

Get ready (Baby) tonight (Girl)
I'm gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready (Get ready) tonight
I'm gonna make this a night to remember

Make this a night to remember

Get ready tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready (Get ready) tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember

Get ready (Baby) tonight (Darlin')
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready (Darlin') tonight (Baby)
Gonna make this a night to remember

This night you won't forget
Gonna make this a night to remember
‘Cause your love I won't regret
Gonna make this a night to remember

Get ready (Baby) tonight (Darlin')
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready (It won't be like the past) tonight (I will make it last)
Gonna make this a night to remember

Tonight
Make this a night to remember
Tonight
Make this a night to remember

Let's make a toast to those who helped make this occasion
They turn their back on love and that's what drove you straight to me
Now to you I make a lasting dedication
I'll show you all that love and life can be, hoo...
And each day that I live I will deliver

Get ready (This night you won't forget) tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready (‘Cause your love I won't regret) tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember

Get ready (Baby) tonight (Darlin')
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready (It won't be like the past) tonight (I will make it last)
Gonna make this a night to remember

Get ready tonight
