Don't hold back!
'Cuz you woke up in the mornin' with initiative to move
So I'll make it harder
Don't hold back!
'Cuz you think about it, so many people do,
Be cool, man, look smarter
Don't hold back!
And you shouldn't even care about those losers in the air
And the crooked stares
Don't hold back!
'Cuz there's a party over here, so you might as well be here
Where the people care
Don't hold back!

The world... (they're holding back...) the time has come to...
The world... (you're holding back...) the time has come to...
The world... (it's holding back...) the time has come to...

To galvanize!

Come on, come on, come on!

Don't hold back!
If you think about it too much you might stumble, trip up,
Fall on your face
Don't hold back!
Don't you think it's time you get up, crunch time like a sit up,
The monkey pace
Don't hold back!
Put apprehension on the back burner, let it sit,
Don't even get it lit
Don't hold back!
Get involved with the jam, don't be a prick,
Hot chick, be a pig
Don't hold back!

The world... (they're holding back...) the time has come to...
The world... (you're holding back...) the time has come to...
The world... (it's holding back...) the time has come to...

To galvanize!

Come on, come on, come on!

(Ooooooooooooooooooh...)

(Ooooooooooooooooooh...)

World, the time has come to... push the button
World, the time has come to... push the button
World, the time has come to... push the button

World, my finger is on the button...
My finger is on the button...
My finger is on the button...

"Push the button"

(Oooooooooooooooooh...)

The time has come to...

(Oooooooooooooooooh...)

GALVANIZE!

The time has come to...

Galvanize!

Galvanize!

Galvanize!
