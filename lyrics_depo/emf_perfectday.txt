I asked my friend I.D.
If he could recall
The last 24 hours and the tv on the floor
Shopping with bricks
In the name of fun I'd take it back officer
But I don't know what I've done 
I've had it all like raindrops in the ocean
Like shadows in the night
The devils in my head have gone away
It's a perfect day 

So we turned it on, tuned it in
Got ourselves a beer
Sat down, began to watch
Everythings clear
Things degenerated we began to sing
Bart Simpson says to us "Elvis was king" 

I've had it all been swimming in emotion
Been swallowed by the night
The devils in my head are here to stay
It's a perfect day
In a sort of pathetic way 

I always run away from the things I cannot see
But when you see double, which one do you believe?
I tried to get some help, I called for my man
He popped up on the tv in a baked been can

I've had it all, like drowning in devotion
Like waiting for the night
The devils in my head have gone away 

It's a perfect day
In a sort of pathetic kind of way
But fuck it
It's a perfect day
In a sort of pathetic kind of way
