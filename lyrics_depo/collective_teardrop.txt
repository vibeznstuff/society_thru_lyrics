We're torn between what's right and what's not
What's up, what's down


Left or right, deep down, on top, full stops
Exclamation mark, punctuation


100%, straight A's, education
University, job prospects, lost objects


New posessions, new friends
Old lessons


New questions, old answers
New message


Repeat sentence, feel presence
Receive gestures


Learn more, seek blessings


Seek forgiveness


Seek freedom, seek vengeance
Be full of life, be vacant
Flee danger, be braver


Love, love is a verb
Love is a doing word
Fearless on my breath
Gentle impulsion
Shakes me, makes me lighter
Fearless on my breath

Teardrop on the fire
Fearless on my breath


Be careful, be reckless
Be reserved, be respected


Be flamboyant, be rejected
Be loved, be neglected
See sense


See nonsense, see the lies
See honesty


See properly, see poorly
See tarnished, see quality


Keep changing, be a changer
Be popular, be a stranger


Do favours, be selfish
Share riches, be homeless


Be selfless, be careless
Be you, be them
Be anyone


Be an enemy, be a friend
But beware


Love, love is a verb
Love is a doing word
Fearless on my breath
Gentle impulsion
Shakes me, makes me lighter
Fearless on my breath

Teardrop on the fire
Fearless on my breath


You can be anything you dream of


A wise man appreciates the time on a cheap watch


Value everything you own


Somebody probably dreams of the bed that you sleep on


Be anything, it's your choice


Always speak your mind


Your voice
We're living in the land of opportunities


You can turn silver into gold with four coins



Come on
Love is a verb
A doing word
On, on my breath


Now don't you quit on me


Makes me lighter


I need you baby


Love, love is a verb
Love is a doing word
Fearless on my breath
