Late night, waiting by the phone
Tonight waiting for an answer
Heartbeat drumming double time
I need one more chance to be near you

Still hanging on, for a while
Can't operate, fired up
I won't eat and I won't sleep for you, yeah
No rest till I get through
â€˜coz I'm holding out, for you
Am I the only one who's insane

Hey you're playing with my delirium
And the longer I wait the harder I'm gonna fall
Stop playing with my delirium
coz I'm outta my head and outta my self control

Still here in this quiet room
Deep in delusion sending me over
Outside watch the world go by
Inside time stands still as I wonder

Still hanging on, for a while
Can't operate, fired up
I won't eat and I won't sleep for you yeah
No rest till I get through
coz I'm holding out, for you
Am I the only one who's insane

Hey You're playing with my delirium
And the longer I wait the harder I'm gonna fall
Stop playing with my delirium
Coz I'm outta my head and outta my self control

(I won't eat eat and I sleep for you yeah)

Hey You're playing with my delirium
And the longer I wait the harder I'm gonna fall
Stop playing with my delirium
coz I'm outta my head and outta my self control
Hey You're playing with my delirium
And the longer I wait the harder I'm gonna fall
Stop playing with my delirium
coz I'm outta my head and outta my self control
