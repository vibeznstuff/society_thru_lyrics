We gone tear this bitch up!
We gone tear that bitch up!


Yeah
Still motherfuck police
We been on that
Till our motherfuckin' nose bleeds
24/7 nigga we ain't gettin' no sleep
Tear the fuckin' city up
Ride for a whole week
Walk around town with a chopper
Gotta keep a round for the coppers
Hit the genocide and kill a nigga every second
We ain't scared we gone pull it out and break em out (brick em)
Man down, they done let the gas out
Fuck retreating bitch we goin' hard until we pass out
My nigga doing fed time
They just hit the stash house
Ain't no picture for the dope
Man you better cash out
And the niggas steady fillin' up the prison
We just tryna' make a better livin'
So they take the father out the home and leave the baby with no guidance and they wonder why these young niggas trippin'

They say there ain't no hope for a young nigga
They said they wouldn't make it past 21
So we walk around with the guns nigga
In the jungle, know you can't trust anyone
So they march around town with the choppers
Gotta keep a round for the coppers
Hit the genocide and killin' niggas every second
We ain't scared they gone put us in the dirt

We gone tear that bitch up! 
Hit the genocide and killin' niggas every second
We ain't scared they gone put us in the dirt


Ride with the 5 round this motherfucker
Take a look outside
Revolution has arrived
Every single thing I touch get ignited in this motherfucker
Hear my ma no cries 
I try I try I try I dream
A day when doctor king
Can come out of fire
Tired of fired up don't you think we fed up
Tell me what a savage look like
Is his eyes blue or brown what his granny cook like
When it all goes down is you standing up
Is you man enough?
If you ain't ready then you better go inside
We been waiting forever for the vendetta to die

Revolution for the future  really help me my nigga
We ain't playing with you we ain't dilly dally my nigga
Fuck 12 nigga you sus
Fuck 12 nigga school sucks
Fuck yeah most of yall used to ku klux
Oh my fault most of yall still do huh?
Fuck 12 nigga you sus
Fuck 12 man school sucks
Fuck yeah most of yall used to ku klux
Oh my fault most of yall still do huh?
