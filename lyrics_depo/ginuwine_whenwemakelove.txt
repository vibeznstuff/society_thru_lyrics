(Listen Baby)...


Your satisfaction
I'll guarantee
Seeing your reaction
Girl that matters to me
Whatever you want me to do
Girl I'll do
Let me give you love
While we make the sounds that lovers do


When we make love you go (aww, aww, aww)
And I'll go
(ohh, ohh)
And thats what it sounds like
When we make love



(Listen baby)...
All night you can call me
Your moans like a song to me
All night I could watch ya
Your body's so perfect to me
I'm gonna take you there
Nice and slow
While we make the sounds of (awww)
And oh, ohh


When we make love you go (aww, aww, aww)
And I'll go
(ohh, ohh)
And thats what it sounds like
When we make love


The cries and the moans
The language your body knows
The ooh's and the ahh's
Means exceptional
Screaming a loud
Stretch to see you go
This is what it sounds like
When we make love



When we make love you go
And I'll go
And that's what it sounds like when we make love
