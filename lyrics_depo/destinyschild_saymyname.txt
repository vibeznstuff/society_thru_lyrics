Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you,
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady,
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you,
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady,
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name


Any other day
I would call, you would say,
"Baby, how's your day?"
But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is "Uh huh", "Yeah, okay"
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady
If you took it there
First of all let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
So prove yourself to me
I'm the girl that you claim
Why don't you say the things
That you said to me yesterday


I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
Where you're saying everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth
If somebody's there, then tell me who




What is up with this
Tell the truth, who you with
How would you like it if I came over with my clique
Don't try and change it now
See you've gotta bounce
When two seconds ago,
Said you just got in the house
It's hard to believe that you are at home by yourself
When I just heard the voice, heard the voice of someone else
Just this question why do you feel you got to lie?
Getting caught up in your game
When you can not say my name





Where my ladies at
(Yea yea yea yea yea yea)
Can you say that, come on
(Yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea)
All the girls say
(Yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea yea)
What? I can't hear you
(Yea yea yea yea)
All my ladies say
(Yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea yea)
All the girls say
(Yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea yea)
Break it down
(Oh woo, oh)
What what what
D.C., take it to the bridge Come on
