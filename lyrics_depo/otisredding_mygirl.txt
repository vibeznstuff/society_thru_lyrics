I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
And it's cold outside, I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make, ooh, me feel this way?
It's my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl

I've got so much loving, the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song that I can sing, than the birds in the trees
I guess you will say
Ooh, what can make me feel this way?
It's my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, ooh

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Ooooh, yeah

I don't need no money, all I need is my fame
I've got all the riches baby one big man can claim
I guess you'd say
Ooh, "What can make you feel this way?"
My girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day with my girl
I've even got the month of May with my, my, my girl
Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout
