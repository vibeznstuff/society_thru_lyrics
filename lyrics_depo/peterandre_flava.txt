Party all night, party all night, party all night
(Roll with da' flava)

Can't bring myself to sleep
So I get the keys to my jeep
There's nothin' that I ain't gonna do tonight
Dial on room number 211
'Cos I hear there's a jam that's goin' on
The feelin' is so good in my neighbourhood

Ooh, there's somethin' special 'bout tonight
And I know it's on
'Cause everybody's got their groove on
I wanna let it go
Are ya' here with me
I wanna hear the party sing


If ya' down throw ya hands up in the air
The mac's back wid da' flava of the year

Here we go there's a party over here
Oh yes there is:
(Party all night, party all night, party all night)

Ain't got no time to think
So I grab a drink
They've got the type that I like and I ain't
Gonna waste no time
Back in the corner of the room
I see the one, and she makes my heart go boom
One smile and I am leavin' all my friends behind

Ooh, there's somethin' special 'bout tonight
And I know it's on (it's on)
'Cause everybody's got their groove on (get a groove on)
I wanna let it go
Are ya' here with me
I'm savin' party - sing it



If ya' wanna swing
Let me do my thing
And everybody jam with me
(everybody, move your body)
If ya' wanna swing
Let me do my thing
And everybody jam with me
(everybody, move your body)


Thorw ya' hands in the air
If ya' know ya' got the flava
Take it all the way
With a man like 'dr'
Flavour in your ear
For the year, no doubt
'Cos I got the wack jam
So turn the party out
I'd like to get with U
get busy, get down
I wanna rock with U
Just like Bobby Brown
Drunk as hell blazin'
Up with smoke
Tonight's the night
Mother **** no joke
