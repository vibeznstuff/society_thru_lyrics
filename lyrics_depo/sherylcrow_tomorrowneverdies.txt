Darling, I'm killed.
I'm in a puddle on the floor
Waiting for you to return

Oh what a thrill
Fascination's galore.
How you tease
How you leave me to burn

It's so deadly, my dear
The power of having you near


Until that day
Until the world falls away
Until you say there'll be no more good-byes
See it in your eyes
Tomorrow never dies

Darling, you won
It's no fun
Martinis, girls, and guns
It's murder on our love affair

But you bet your life
Every night
While you're chasing the morning light
You're not the only spy out there

It's so deadly, my dear
The power of wanting you near



Until that day
Until the world falls away
Until you say there'll be no more good-byes
See it in your eyes

Until that day
