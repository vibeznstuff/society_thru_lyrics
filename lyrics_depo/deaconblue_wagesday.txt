There he stood and there we left
Outside the flashing neon sign
With the smell of cheap cigars
And the hope of sweet perfume
And his heart it was reeling
With the thrill of it all
All to do and only hours
He said all this is all yours

You can have it all
You can take it all away
From where we left off
Living it all
Your way
If you'll stand in my shoes
If you'll do what I do
On a wages day
On a wages day

And the cap from Disneyland
That his cousin she brought back
Stays open in his hand
From one week to another
And this long narrow land
Is full of possibility
All to do and only hours
He said all this is all yours

You can have it all
You can take it all away
From where we left off
Living it all
Your way
If you'll stand in my shoes
If you'll do what I do
On a wages day
On a wages day

And you can have it all
You can take it all away
From where we left off
Living it all
Your way
If you'll stand in my shoes
If you'll do what I do
On a wages day
On a wages day

On a wages day
On a wages day
On a wages day
On a wages day
If you'll do what I do
On a wages day
