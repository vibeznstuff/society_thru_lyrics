Most of the time you are happy you're
A weirdo and before the introduction
Ends there is someone feeling sorry
For themselves

Look at your ugly shame what are you
Talking for look at your ugly shame

Most of the time you are demanding
What am I doing here and I don't want to
Be and the hurt in which you bare you
Could say goodbye to this earth

Look at your ugly shame what are you
Talking for look at your ugly shame
There's too much for me to know about

Most of the time you are happy you're a
Weirdo and your nerve is my device and
Makes me sad

Look at your ugly shame what are you
Talking for look at your ugly shame
There's too much for me to know about
