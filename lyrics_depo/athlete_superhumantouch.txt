I'm on fire and nothing's gonna hold me back
Endless blue sky and a pocket full of tricks to try
You pick a colour and I'll sing it for you
I know you feel the same way
Say, say, say you feel the same way.

Fingertips alive - superhuman touch
Can't get enough of this electric love
Burning the sun with just a wave of your hand
Sparks flying out in every direction
There's more of this to come I think it must be heaven
Burning the sun with just a wave of your hand

I'm on fire, golden echoes upon my face
Tell those dreamers
They can dream up all they like in this place
You pick a colour and I'll sing it for you
I know you feel the same way
Say, say, say you feel the same way.

Fingertips alive - superhuman touch
Can't get enough of this electric love
Burning the sun with just a wave of your hand
Sparks flying out in every direction
There's more of this to come I think it must be heaven
Burning the sun with just a wave of your hand

Just one day like this will keep me going on
Tender kisses will keep me going on

Fingertips alive - superhuman touch
Can't get enough of this electric love
Burning the sun with just a wave of your hand
Sparks flying out in every direction
There's more of this to come I think it must be heaven
Burning the sun with just a wave of your hand

Seems like heaven's broken loose
It couldn't be more beautiful
I just want to burn the sun with you
A messed up garden to inspire
The greatest minds in all their power
I just want to burn the sun with you
In just a wave of your hand.
