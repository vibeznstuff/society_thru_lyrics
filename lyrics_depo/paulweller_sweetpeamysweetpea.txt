Sweet pea, my sweet pea
You're the one to get my heart a-jumpin'
Light of love all around your
Being to see

The future - it's looking at you
It only exists because you're alive
So close your eyes and smile
Your smiles of sweet dreams

And fill them with love again
Sweet pea
Fill them with joy again

Each pace I take and you know why
I write for you and I to try
To take the things that lie around
And turn them into dreams so swift-so proud
It's on a time again
And it's mine again

Sweet thing, loving you is easy
Goodbye sadness when I'm around you
Giving me something I can feel
Down to in bones

Ah, sometimes - maybe just sometimes
Look back on these times and smile
And have the grace to know
What you have seen

And fill you with love again
Sweet pea
(You) fill me with hope again!
My Sweet Pea

Recollected thoughts and songs
Emblems of forgotten words
Remnants of a time so clear
That still rings fresh and true
When the wind is here
It's on a time again
And it's mine again!

Sweet pea, my sweet pea
Heaven knows I got a thing about you
You're the girl to get my heart
Start jumpin' again

Ah, sometimes - baby just sometimes
Look back on these times and smile
And have the grace to know
What you have seen

How it should be - my sweet pea
Only God knows what I feel about you
You're the girl to get my heart
Start pumpin' around

The Future? - its looking at you
It only exists because you're alive
So close your eyes and smile
Your smiles of sweet dreams...

Fill them with love again
Sweet pea
Fill them with joy again
Yes, sweet thing
Fill them with love again
My sweet pea
