I'm sorry you saw me shaking
Stay with me for a day
I've got no one to hold me
Cause I, I turn them all away

I don't wanna be alone
But I'm better on my own


Cause I'm fragile
God, I'm fragile


I'm sorry you saw me breaking
But stay with me don't stray
God, I wish you would hold me closely
Don't think I don't feel the same

I'm better on my own
But I don't wanna be alone


Cause I'm fragile
God, I'm fragile

God, I wish I could love you
God, I wish I could love you
God, I wish I could love you
God, I wish I could love you

Cause I'm fragile
God, I'm fragile
