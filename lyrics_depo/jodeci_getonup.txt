Said it sounds so good to me
You gotta get on up now
Say it again, Jodeci
Get on up
You gotta get on up now
Wait a minute, let me tell you
Everybody grab somebody
Turn this mutha into a party
Fellas take your lady's hand
Ladies go and choose your man
There's no need to be afraid
Friday night, let's all get payed
Positive is the attitude
Negative is not the mood



Get on up
You gotta get on up
Get on up now
Let us say it again
You gotta get on up now
And you can't sit down

Now that everybody's movin
Everybody in here is groovin
Everything is alright
The atmosphere is so nice
The DJ is doin his duty
All the ladies shakin their bootys
And the night is still young
And the party's just begun

Get on up
And you can't sit down
Gotta get on up now
And you can't sit down
Get on up
And you can't sit down
Gotta get on up now

Party
All day
Never stop
Never stop
And you can't sit down

Get on up
And you can't sit down
Gotta get on up now
And you can't sit down
Get on up
Everybody just get on up
You gotta get on up now
Get on up
