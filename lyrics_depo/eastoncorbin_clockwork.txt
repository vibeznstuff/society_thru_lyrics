Might as well have my alarm set on my phone girl
It's like you got a camera, don't know how you know, I'm home alone girl
Come around 10:47 every Friday night
Might as well leave the light on, cause you're always right on time

You call, I say hello
You knock, I'm lettin' you in
You say, you've missed
My lips, we kiss
Here we go again
Your dress, my shirt
We love, I live and never learn
I crash, I burn
You leave, I hurt
Like clockwork

It's like I'm walkin' down the street and fall in that same trap, girl
I see a freight train comin' and I just stand there on the tracks, girl
Somebody'd be gettin' rich if they were placin' bets
On me thinkin' no, no, no, always sayin' yes

You call, I say hello
You knock, I'm lettin' you in
You say, you've missed
My lips, we kiss
Here we go again
Your dress, my shirt
We love, I live and never learn
I crash, I burn
You leave, I hurt
Like clockwork

It's too easy, you know my street
And you know where I leave my key
Baby you know me, I can count on you, to count on me
It's like a movie I've seen a thousand times
I hate the end but I still hit rewind

You call, I say hello
You knock, I'm lettin' you in
You say, you've missed
My lips, we kiss
Here we go again
Your dress, my shirt
We love, I live and never learn
I crash, I burn
You leave, I hurt
Like clockwork

Like clockwork
