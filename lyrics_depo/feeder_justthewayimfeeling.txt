Love in, love out, find the feeling
Scream in, scream out, time for healing
You feel the moments gone too soon,
You're watching clouds come over you.

Torn in two,
You close your eyes for some place new,
Torn in two


And I feel it's going down,
Ten feet below the ground,
I'm waiting for your healing hand,
One touch could bring me round,
I feel we're going down,
Ten feet below the ground,
It's just the way I'm feeling

Glow in, burn out, 
Lost the feeling
Bruise in, you bruise out,
Nurse the bleeding

Torn in two,
Each time we bruise


Yeah yeah, it's just the way I'm feeling

Two different views,
As words confuse and break
I can't get out,
There's no way out of here,
I can't get clear.

Love in, love out
Find the feeling.


Yeah, yeah, it's just the way I'm feeling.....
