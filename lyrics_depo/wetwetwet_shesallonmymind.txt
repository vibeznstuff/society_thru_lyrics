There's a place for just the two of us,
There's a love for us to share,
Something special just the two if us

Wishing on my star
That I don't spend a lifetime without you,
Without you

She's gonna make it alright,
And hold me inside,
She's all on my mind.

If I thought for just one second, girl,
You'd be seeing someone new,
And if I didn't know you better girl,

Wishing on my star
To heal this empty feeling,
Without you

She's gonna make it alright,
And hold me inside,
She's all on my mind.

Look in my eyes,
And take what you wanna,
Look in my heart,
There's a place for you,
Some other loving,
It doesn't make a bit of sense
You know I didn't mind when
You stole my heart...

She's gonna make it alright,
And hold me inside,
She's all on my mind.

She's gonna make it alright,
And hold me inside,
She's all on my mind.
