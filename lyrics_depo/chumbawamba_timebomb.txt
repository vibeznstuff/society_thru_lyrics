Stop now
What's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop now
What's that sound

Stop now
What's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop now
What's that sound

I am a timebomb
A ticking ticking ticking timebomb
I am a timebomb
A ticking ticking ticking timebomb

Unattended on the railway station
In the litter at the dancehall
Sitting pretty near the fastfood-counter
In the backseat of a Vauxhall

I am a timebomb
A ticking ticking ticking timebomb
I am a timebomb
A ticking ticking ticking timebomb

Stop now
What's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop now
What's that sound

I am a timebomb
A ticking ticking ticking timebomb
I am a timebomb
A ticking ticking ticking timebomb

Hear the ticking of your heartbeat beating
Hear the breaking of their promises
Hear the smashing of your expectations
Hear the shattering of half-rhymes

I am a timebomb
A ticking ticking ticking timebomb
I am a timebomb
A ticking ticking ticking timebomb

Stop now
What's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop now
What's that sound

You know
Time tells you
Ah-ah-ah-ah

And all the timebombs
They're all dancing to the same song
In a world full of no ones
I am a someone
Timebomb
Timebomb
Timebomb
Timebomb

Stop now
What's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop now
What's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop now
What's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop now
What's that sound
London Bridge is falling down
