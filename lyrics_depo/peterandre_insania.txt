Take a look around
At what technology is found
Is is what we need or are we killing the scene?
Dictated by the screen
No more following your dreams
The worlds become a difficult place to be

Where are we going?
Does anyone care?
Hold on to real love?
There's so much to share


Do Do Do Do Do
Do Do Do Do Do
Do Do Do Do Do
This is Insania 

Agent will reverse
Cloning will diverse
Insanity is slowly creeping into our minds (Yeah)
Where is yesterday? (Yeah)
Cos people ain't the same
Have we lost the faith or have we lost our minds?

Where are we going?
Does anyone care?
Hold on to real love 
Theres so much to share
