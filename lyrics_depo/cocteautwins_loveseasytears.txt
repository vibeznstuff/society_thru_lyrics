Love, without him
She ought to know he owns himself
Love, without him
She ought to know

Gee, how many loved her man
How he could have done that he lived so loved
The phone rang
Die, so long, so love
Yea, man, joys of love said them

Love, without him
She ought to know he owns himself
Love, without him
She ought to know

Gee, how many loved her man
How he could have done that he lived so loved
The phone rang
Die, so long, so love
Yea, man, joys of love said them

Joys of love had the cat on the couch these days
Don't go leave me out
Every stuffy day I go home
Plus you don't know love

Gee, how many loved her man
How he could have done that?
He lived so loved
The phone rang
Die, so long, so love
Yea, man, joys of love said them
(Please, please, please)
