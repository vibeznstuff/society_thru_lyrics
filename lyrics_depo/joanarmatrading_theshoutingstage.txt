I thought we had it sweet
But your mind's played
A trick on me
I thought that I'd be with you
All the time
And I'd be fine
Yeah I'd be fine

I'll swear you have my feelings
Under thought control
I know you've taken
Such a hold on me
I'm thinking more and more
Of what we had before

Before we lost it
At the shouting stage
Before the days we'd sit there
Side by side
Without a word
And how that hurt

How could eternal love
Made above
We were so in love
We were joined up at the sides
How could two people
Be as one
As one
Blind from the same light
Be out of love with love
In no time

I thought we had it made
But my mind's played
This trick on me
I thought that I would see you
All the time
And I'd be fine
Mmm I'd be fine

I swear you have no feelings
Or you'd call me home
I know there's no one else
There's no one else
Is there
I'm thinking more and more
Of what we had before

We lost it
At the shouting stage
Before we lost it
At the shouting stage
