See the look on my face
From staying too long in one place
But every time I try to leave
I find I keep on stalling
Feel like a big old stone
Standing by a strength of my own
But every time the morning breaks
I know I'm closer to falling

I'm all out of love, all out of faith
I would give everything just for a taste
Everything's here, all out of place
Losing my memory, saving my face
Saving my face, saving my face
Saving my face.

Listening to what you say
Even though I look the other way
You could never understand the feeling
Of what I'm leaving

I'm all out of love, all out of faith
I would give everything just for a taste
Everything's here, all out of place
Losing my memory, saving my face
Saving my face...

Whoa, ooh...

Leave it all to me
I will do the right thing
Baby I'll be everything I need
Leave it all to me
I will do the right thing
Baby I'll be everything I need
Leave it all to me
I will do the right thing
Do the right thing

I'm all out of love, all out of faith
I would give everything just for a taste
Everything's here, all out of place
Losing my memory, I'm losing the best of me.

I'm all out of love, all out of faith
I would give everything just for a taste
Everything's here, all out of place
Losing my memory, saving my face
Saving my face...

Whoa, ooh...
