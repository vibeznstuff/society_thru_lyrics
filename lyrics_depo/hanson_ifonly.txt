Well every single time I see you I start to feel this way 
It makes me wonder if I am ever gonna feel this way again. 
There's a picture 
tearin 
in the back of my head 
I see it over and over 
I wanna hold you and love you 
In my arms and then 
I wanna need you 
cuz I need to be with you till the end 
Then I hear myself reply "You've got to hold it in" this time tonight 

If only I had the guts to feel this way, if only you'd look at me and 
want to stay, if only I could take you in my arms and say, I won't go cuz I 
need you 

Sit here waiting, wondering, hoping that I'll make this right 
Cuz all I think about is your hands, your face and all these lonely nights 
There's a feeling screaming in the back of my head 
Saying it over and over 
I wanna hold you and love you 
In my arms and then 
I wanna need you 
cuz I need to be with you till the end 
Then I hear myself reply "She'll never let you in" this time tonight 

If only I had the guts to feel this way, if only you'd look at me and wanna 
stay, if only I could take you in my arms and say, I won't go cuz I need you 
I wanna hear you say it'll always be this way 

And we'll be hand in hand for everynight and everyday 
I wanna scream and shout cuz rules are never doubt 
And all I care about is you and me and us and now 
If only I had the guts to feel this way, if only you'd look at me and wanna 
stay, if only I could take you in my arms and say, I won't go cuz I need you 

Please don't go cause I need you now 
Yeah. Cuz I need you 
If only, yeah cuz I need you now 
If only cuz I need you, I need you 
If only , cuz I need you 
If only cuz I need you 
If only, yeah, if only...I need you now....yeah
