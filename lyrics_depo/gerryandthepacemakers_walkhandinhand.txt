Walk hand in hand with me, through all eternity
Have faith believe in me, give me your hand
Love is a symphony, a perfect harmony
When lovers such as we, walk hand in hand

Be not afraid for I am with you all the while
Lift your head up high and look towards the sky

Walk hand in hand with me, this is our destiny
No greater love could be, give me your hand, walk with me

Walk hand in hand with me, o-oh this is our destiny
No greater love could be, give me your hand
Walk with me!
