Hold it

Hovering over
Looking over the shoulder
Suspense suspect
Who got next game
Hanging us by the necks
Hold onto your purses and wallets
By George, he's the new Wallace
Show no shame, no malice
Wondering who's this new Alice
Check check 1-2 1-2
Alabama Indiana
They be coming around asking
Who the fuck is you?
He be coming around that mountain
How the West was won
Mother fucker didn't ever run
Hero here he come

All hail to the chief
Who came in the name of a thief
To cease peace
He'll be comin' around that mountain


All hail to the chief
Who came in the name of a thief
To cease peace

And he didn't even run 

They lie when they say we matter
Lies of a whole new chapter
Smile when you meet your master
Lookin' in the eye of the rapture
They lie when they say we matter
Some rather believe in a liar
Pride in the heart of believers
While the city ignites like a fire
While ya life hangs in the balance
The innocent caught in the violence
Silence everybody that ain't like us
Devising words to divide us
Fear in the heart of the millions
One percent with their billions
Savage politicians got the whole world ripe for the pickin'

All hail to the chief
Who came in the name of a thief
To cease peace
He'll be comin' around that mountain


All hail to the chief
Who came in the name of a thief
To cease peace

And he didn't even run 

666 666 suspense
Sick sick sick sick sick sick suspense
666 666 suspense
Sick sick sick sick sick sick

Here he come 

All hail to the chief
Who came in the name of a thief
To cease peace
He'll be comin' around that mountain


All hail to the chief
Who came in the name of a thief
To cease peace
And he didn't even run
