Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da
It's in 
Your eyes
And the way you move
You got music in your step
A kind
Of glow
Like you walk with the heat turned up
So brightly above

Suddenly I see
I go ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da
Everytime you walk in the room
No escape for me
I go ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da
Everytime you're close to me

If I could just
Compose myself
I'd radiate just the right amount of cool and heat
So you'd never know
How I tremble to touch you

Suddenly I see
I go ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da
Everytime you walk in the room
No escape for me
I go ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da
Everytime you're close to me

Suddenly I see
I go ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da
Everytime you walk in the room
No escape for me
I go ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da
Everytime you're close to me
