So this is where we are
It's not where we had wanted to be
If half the world's gone mad
The other half just don't care, you see

You don't want to fuck with us
British till the very last

When it feels like the world's gone mad
And there's nothing you can do about it
No there's nothing you can do about it
When it feels like the world's gone mad
And there's nothing you can do about it
No there's nothing you can do about it

So tell me what's the news
And what is it you want me to see
We're lying to ourselves
And dancing by the light of the screen

You don't want to fuck with us
British till the very last

When it feels like the world's gone mad
And there's nothing you can do about it
No there's nothing you can do about it
When it feels like the world's gone mad
And there's nothing you can do about it
No there's nothing you can do about it

Another man holding a microphone
Trying to say something at all
Or finding himself on an empty road
Trying to choose which way to go

And so, you wanna make some money?
You wanna make some money
So, you wanna be somebody?
You wanna make some money

When it feels like the world's gone mad
And there's nothing you can do about it
No there's nothing you can do about it
When it feels like the world's gone mad
And there's nothing you can do about it
No there's nothing you can do about it
