I wouldn't want to be you
Mostly not even near you
When you're gone they will curse you
And raise the tide against you 

I no longer care now
For what you said was fair now
I just don't go there now
I just don't go 

Maybe there's a way not to make it hurt
To cover up the words like you covered up the dirt
Ever since you left
It just gets worse
Living out in your town 

Now let's say it like it is
I just don't know where to begin
It's a different way of living
It's so strange to what we've been

First we speak for ourselves now
And people know who we are now
And they wake up and they live now
Yes they wake up and they live

Maybe there's a way not to let it hurt
Tell it out in pictures
And songs and words
Do what we should not
To make it worse
Living out in your town
