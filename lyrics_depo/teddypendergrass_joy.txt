It's a joy
Joy to be
To be near you
I want you here with me

It's a joy
Joy to be
To be near you
I want you here with me

Lady, can't you see just how much you mean to me
Get a thrill each time I'm near you
I get such a rush, I crave to feel your tender touch
Magic moment paradise, oh, baby

Life is too damn short to let you get away
I'm here to say I need your love, oh, baby
There's no greater pleasure than you give to me
Hear me, baby, I want you to know

It's a joy
Joy to be
To be near you
I want you here with me

It's a joy
(It's a joy)
Joy to be
To be near you
I want you here with me

Darling, don't you know, my heart longs to hold you so
Passion burns inside my mind
You're my fantasy, no other love can set me free
I'm glad to know that you're all mine, mine

Sailing through the night, I'll find the certain pleasures
A million stars feel like the moon, so full of love
Nothin' takes the place of romance since you came
But all we need is you and me, baby
(You and me)

It's a joy
Joy to be
To be near you
I want you here with me

It's a joy
Joy to be
I wanna be near you
I want you here with me

It's a joy
Joy to be
To be near you
I. I want you here with me

It's a joy, oh, baby
Joy to be
To be near you
I want you here with me

We're meant to be and I know we can win
At times I feel like a kid on a Ferris wheel
You make my world go 'round and around
So much to live for and I'm livin' it now

Joy
(Yeah)

Oh, come let me hold you
Come let me squeeze you

Come let me kiss you
Oh, 'cause I miss you

Oh, let me tease you
