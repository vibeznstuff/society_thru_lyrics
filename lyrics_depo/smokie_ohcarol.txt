Well I was out cruisin', getting late and I was losin',
When I saw you walking my way,
So nonchalant, I bet you get what you want,
But so do I and I ain't losing today.

Well your hips were swinging and your jeans were clinging,
You were driving me out of my mind,
On a hot afternoon when there's nothing to do,
You're not the sort of thing a fellow should find,

So I pulled on over, tossed your hair off your shoulder,
As you turned and you looked my way,
Oh you would have died or you'd have skinned me alive,
If I'd have said what I wanted to say,

So being polite said what you doin' tonight,
You said just so happens I'm free,
You got all the right curves and all the right words,
And that's alright by me.

Oh Carol you got me eatin' my heart away,
You got me countin' my nights and days,
Oh I am floatin' on the milky way,
Oh Carol nobody's done it before,
Oh baby you've opened the door,
Oh Carol you can do it some more.

Well if you're ready for this when we started to kiss,
She said hold on a minute or two.
Well naturally I knew it couldn't be me,
I said baby what's troublin' you,

She said I'm not sixteen if you know what I mean,
So we sat and we talked for a while,
And when we finally kissed you know she didn't resist,
And I must say she did it with style.

Oh Carol you got me eatin' my heart away,
You got me countin' my nights and days,
Oh I am floatin' on the milky way,
Oh Carol nobody's done it before,
Oh baby you've opened the door,
Oh Carol you can do it some more.

Well I was out cruisin', getting late and I was losin',
When I saw you walking my way,
So nonchalant, I bet you get what you want,
But so do I and I ain't losing today.

Oh Carol you got me eatin' my heart away,
You got me countin' my nights and days,
Oh I am floatin' on the milky way,
Oh Carol nobody's done it before,
Oh baby you've opened the door,
Oh Carol you can do it some more.

Oh Carol you got me eatin' my heart away,
You got me countin' my nights and days,
Oh I am floatin' on the milky way,
Oh Carol nobody's done it before,
Oh baby you've opened the door,
Oh Carol you can do it some more.
Oh Carol, baby you can do it some more.
Oh Carol, baby you can do it some more.
