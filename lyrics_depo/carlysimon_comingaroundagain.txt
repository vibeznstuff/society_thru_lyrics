Baby sneezes
Mummy pleases
Daddy breezes in
So good on paper
So romantic
But so bewildering


I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again
So don't mind if I fall apart
There's more room in a broken heart

You pay the grocer
Fix the toasted
Kiss the host Good-bye
Then you break a window
Burn the Souffl
