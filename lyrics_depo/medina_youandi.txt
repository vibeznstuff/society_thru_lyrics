Nothing left for me to say
There's no more wicked games to play
It's time for me to walk away
I am alright
I feel like I'm on a high
A new beginning that is my life
Iâ€™m turning to the rhythm of the night
I am alright 

The music is making me growing
The only thing that keeps me awake is me knowing
There's no one here to break me or bring me down
And no one here to hurt me or fool around

I have no more time for you to hurt my feelings
Done enough to prove I'm all that I believe in
We are at the end, no more stupid lies
I'm better off without you here by my side
So now there is no longer

You and I 
There is no longer
You and I 
There is no longer
You and I 

Don't care what other people say
I know you fool around all day
No it doesn't hurt me anyway
I am alright aah

And when the the day turns into night
I'm in the club forgetting you and I
And when I think of how you treated me 
you proved me right

The music is making me growing
The only thing that keeps me awake is me knowing
There's no one here to break me or bring me down
And no one here to hurt me or fool around

I have no more time for you to hurt my feelings
Done enough to prove I'm all that I believe in
We are at the end, no more stupid lies
I'm better off without you here by my side
So now there is no longer

You and I 
There is no longer
You and I 
There is no longer
You and I
