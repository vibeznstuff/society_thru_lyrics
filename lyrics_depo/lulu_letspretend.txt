I only live because you love me
I'd die the day you said goodbye
I wanna hear you say you love me
Even though it's a lie

Let's pretend
Things are like they were before the end
Let's pretend
We're still lovers and not just friends

Trick my mind with a light from your lips
Fool my feeling with your fingertips

Cheat my soul with a promise you'll break
Keep me dreaming, I don't want to wake
And let's pretend, let's pretend

I'm only happy when you're near me
And if you haven't learned by now
It doesn't matter if you love me
I've got to have you somehow

Let's pretend
Things are like they were before the end
Let's pretend
We're still lovers and not just friends

Trick my mind with a light from your lips
Fool my feeling with your fingertips
Cheat my soul with a promise you'll break
Keep me dreaming, I don't want to wake

And let's pretend, let's pretend

Let's pretend, let's pretend, let's pretend
