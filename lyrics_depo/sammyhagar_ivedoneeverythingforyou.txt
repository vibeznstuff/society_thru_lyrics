This one way love affair ain't fair
It ain't no kind of fair to me
It's all give and take, and you just take
And I can't take it, you see

Well, I'm givin' up on love this time
Me and my friends, we'll do just fine
Because

I've done everything for you
Oh yeah, you've done nothin' for me
I've done everything for you
You've done nothin' for me
You've done nothin' for me 

Yeah, you knew that someday I'd have a whole lotta money
And be a millionaire
Yeah, but when that didn't happen overnight
I found out how much you really cared

Yeah, all you want is a whole lotta money 
All the rest is just jivin' honey

I've done everything for you 
Aw lord, you've done nothin' for me
I've done everything for you
I've done everything, you've done nothin' for me
(You've done nothin' for me)

Now wait a minute
When I first met you, you didn't know how to hook a man
(You've done nothin')
There was so many things about makin' love you didn't understand 
(You've done nothin')
Yeah, but now you know about everything 
And I'm tradin' you in on a pair of wings 

I've done everything for you
Yeah, yeah, you've done nothin' for me
I've done everything for you 
Baby, you've done nothing for me
You've done nothing for me

Now I'm going out on the town tonight and get as wild as I can be 
I'm gonna find out what it's really like to be loose, high and free 
Yeah and I don't care what them people say 
'Cause I'll change my mind, I'm changin' to stay

I've done everything for you
Baby, baby you've done nothin' for me
I've done everything for you
You, you've done nothin' for me
I've done everything for you
Everything, but nothin' for me
I've done everything for you
Baby, you've done nothin' for me

You've done nothin' for me
You, you've done nothin' for me
You've done nothin'
You've done nothin'
You've done nothin' for me
Zero, nothin' ow!
