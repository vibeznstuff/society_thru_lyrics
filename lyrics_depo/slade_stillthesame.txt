Oh we ain't goin' nowhere 
We're just looking for somewhere 
Whatever pulled us apart 
Is still the same - It's still the same 

Oh we're all one day older 
Your hands are gradually colder 
What made me weak at the knees 
Is still the same - It's still the same 

Oh you ain't been so tender 
Your smell ain't how I remember 
Although your eau de cologne 
Is still the same - It's still the same 
Oh I ain't a great romancer 
And I ain't got all of the answers 
What made me weak at the knees 
Is still the same - It's still the same 

Nothing's changed - I'm taking the blame 
No nothing has changed - It's still the same 
Nothing's changed - Start over again 
It's all in the game - It's still the same - It's still the same 

Oh I know nothing's changing 
I know I need re-arranging 
I know I'm taking the blame 
it's still the same - It's still the same 

Oh I know nothing's changing 
I know there's nothing remaining 
I know it's all in the game 
it's still the same - It's still the same 

Nothing's changed - I'm taking the blame 
No nothing has changed - It's still the same 
Nothing's changed - Start over again 
It's all in the game - It's still the same 
It's still the same - Nothing's changed 
Start over again - It's all in the game 
It's still the same - It's still the same
