In pitch dark I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches trip me as I speak
Just cos you feel it doesn't mean it's there
Just cos you feel it doesn't mean it's there
There's always a siren singing you to shipwreck (don't reach out, don't reach out )
Stay away from these rocks we'd be a walking disaster (don't reach out, don't reach out )
Just cos you feel it doesn't mean it's there (there's someone on your shoulder )
Just coz you feel it doesn't mean it's there (there's someone on your shoulder )
There there...
Why so green
And lonely 
Heaven sent you
To me 
We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen
We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen
