There's something going on
Something not quite right
There's something strange
A-happening to me
There's someone at the door
Hear voices in my head
It seems things aren't the way
They ought to be

Who needs love like that
Who needs love like that

It seemed so clear before
I held my point of view
I kept my conversation
Never changed
And now it's all gone wrong
And words are kind of hard
And nothing else around me
Looks the same

Who needs love like that
Who needs love like that

Love can turn you upside-down
Then leave you cold
It's plain to see
You're losing all control (Losing all control)

Who needs love like that
Who needs love like that

I'd like to understand
Like to find out why
I can't remember all
The lines I should say
But then I see your face
And nothing really counts
Don't tell me now
This feeling will stay

Who needs love like that
Who needs love like that

Love can turn you upside-down
Then leave you cold
It's plain to see
You're losing all control

Who needs love like that
Who needs love like that (Who needs love like that)

Who needs love like that
Who needs love like that
(Who needs love like that)
Who needs love like that
(Who needs love like that)
Who needs love like that
(Who needs love like that)
Who needs love like that
(Who needs love like that)
Who needs love like that
(Who needs love like that)
