I long for the warmth of days gone by 
When you were mine 
But now those days are memories in time 
Life's empty without you by my side 
My heart belongs to you 
No matter what I try 

When I get courage up to love somebody new 
It always falls apart cause they just 
Can't compare to you 
You love won't release me 
I'm bound under ball and chain 
Reminiscing our love as I watch four season's change 



In comes the winter breeze 
That chills the air and drifts the snow 
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe 
When springtime makes its way here 
Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume 
When summer burns with heat 
I always get the hots for you 
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do 
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare 
When you're not here it doesn't feel the same 

Remember the nights when we closed our eyes 
And vowed that you and I would be in love for all time 
Anytime I think about these things is shared with you 
I break down and cry cause I get so emotional 
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain 
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change 




This loneliness 
Has crushed my heart 
Please let me love again 
Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain 
Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again
