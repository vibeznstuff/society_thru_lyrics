
Let me break it down and tell you what your sex is like
Yeah
I don't know what it is
What it feels like
Sex with you
It's like
Heh, it's like
Damn
I don't really know what it's like
But uh, let me try to explain.


Sex with you is like when I wake up in the morning
Smell that good old breakfast mama use to make
Sex with you is like the feeling that you get
When all your friends surprise you on your birthday
Sex with you is like, like I made the last shot and everybody screaming my name
Sex with you is like my pocket full of dough and I don't worry 'bout a damn thing


When I think about the sex
Nothing better comes to mind
I wanna sex you all the damn time
Thinking 'bout the sex
It's got me wantin' you to come through
And do sex like we always do
Sex with you is really the best with you
It makes life worth going through
Ain't nobody got a body like you
'Cause my sex with you meets my needs, ain't gotta go lookin' in the street it's you
Ain't nothing better then the way we do
Girl I love having sex with you


Sex with you is like winning an award after working so damn hard
Sex with you is like when the man at the dealer ship hands over the keys to my new car
Sex with you like when that check comes in the mail after been broke for so long
Sex with you is like its like getting out the pin and shorty is there to take you home




It's all about the freaky things we do
And I know, you like it just as much as I do
Baby I ain't never try to hit and run
I'm just trying to make you the only one
I'll sex you up on the regular
'Cause ain't nothing better then sex with you:uh

Let me break it down and tell you what your sex is like
Sex with you is like going to the strip club
And ain't gotta pay for none of that strip love
Sex with you is like, like a closet full of air force, my white, my size
Sex with you is like, like be the first nigga in the hood with back drop top 645

Sex with you is really the best with you
It makes life worth going through
Ain't nobody got a body like you
'Cause my sex with you meets my needs, ain't gotta go lookin' in the street it's you
Ain't nothing better then the way we do
(I can have sex with you all night long
Till six in the morning, holla)
Girl I love having sex with you
