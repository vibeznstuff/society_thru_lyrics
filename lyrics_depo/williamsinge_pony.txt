I'm just a bachelor
Looking for a partner
Someone who knows how to ride
Without even falling off

Gotta be compatible
Takes me to my limits
So girl when I break you off
I promise that you won't want to get off

If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it

If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it

If you wanna get nasty, baby
First we'll show and tell
Till I reach your ponytail, yeah
Lurk all over and through you baby
Until we reach this stream
You'll be on my jockey team

Horny, do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it
