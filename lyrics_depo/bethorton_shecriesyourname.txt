Falling from the western slopes to find yourself alone again
Wonderin' where you have been
Your lonely voice calls across the starlit coast
Reaching out to be seen

She cries your name
Three times again
She cries your name
How long can this love remain?

Scratch beneath the surface screen of what we say and what we see
Is there truth to be seen?
She's cryin' out your name
But her scream sounds the same
How fickle fate can be

She cries your name
Three times again
She cries your name
How long can this love remain?

Birds which scream for territory can learn to sing euphorically
Given time that is real
There's a wasteland in his soul
The burned out trees will leave you cold
Living out beside the hill

She cries your name
Three times again
She cries your name
How long can this love remain?

She cries your name
Three times again
She cries your name
How long can this love remain?

She cries your name
Twelve times again
She cries your name
How long can this love remain?
