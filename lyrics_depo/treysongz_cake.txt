Baby, this might sound rude
I'm taken but I want you
And I don't wanna play by the book, no rules
They say you can't have cake and eat it too, but ain't that what you s'posed to do?
Ain't you s'posed to eat it too?
Ain't that what you s'posed to do?
Ain't I s'posed to eat it too?
Cake's on the menu
Cake's-cake's on the menu
Cake's-cake's-cake's on the menu
I'd like to have dessert for starters
Tell me baby, can't you take my order?

Hey pretty lady, give me some of that cake
I'd like to place an order, ooh, I just wanna taste, and ooh I'd hate to wait
Lay your body down all over my plate
Once I blow the candles out, put it in my face
So tell me you gon' serve it up nice
The customer's always right, baby



Light-skinned girls got that red velvet
Dark-skinned girls chocolate
White girls got vanilla frosting
Cake tastes great, I love all of it
I've got a sweet tooth and it's just for you
It ain't hard to see it through, girl, I know you want to
So tell me you gon' serve it up nice
The customer's always right, baby



Ain't that what you s'posed to do?
