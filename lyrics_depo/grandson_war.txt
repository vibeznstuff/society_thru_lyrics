Until the philosophy, which holds one race superior
And another
Inferior
Is finally
And permanently
Discredited and abandoned

And it's war in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south
And it's war in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south

Everywhere is war
It's a war
Oh, everywhere is war
It's a war

And until there's no longer
First and second class citizens of any nation
It's on
And until the color of a man's skin serves no more
Significance than the color of his eyes
We say war

And it's war in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south
And it's war in the east
War in the west
War up north
And war down south

Everywhere is...
Oh, everywhere is war
It's a war
Oh, everywhere is war
It's a war
Oh, everywhere is war

Everywhere is...
Everywhere is war
Everywhere is war
