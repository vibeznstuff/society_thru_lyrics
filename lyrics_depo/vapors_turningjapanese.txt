I've got your picture of me and you
You wrote, "I love you," I wrote "Me, too"
I sit there staring and there's nothing else to do
Oh, it's in color, your hair is brown
Your eyes are hazel and soft as clouds
I often kiss you when there's no one else around

I've got your picture, I've got your picture 
I'd like a million of them all round my cell
I want the doctor to take your picture 
So I can look at you from inside as well 
You've got me turning up and turning down 
And turning in and turning 'round

I'm turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so
I'm turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so

I've got your picture, I've got your picture
I'd like a million of them all round my cell
I want a doctor to take your picture
So I can look at you from inside as well 
You got me turning up and turning down
I'm turning in, I'm turning round

I'm turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so 
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so 
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so 
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so

I've got your picture, I've got your picture 
I'd like a million of them all round myself
I want a doctor to take a picture
So I can look at you from inside as well 
You got me turning up and turning down
I'm turning in, I'm turning round

I'm turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so 
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so 
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so 
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so

No sex, no drugs, no wine, no women, no fun, no sin, no you, no wonder it's dark 
Everyone around me is a total stranger 
Everyone avoids me like a cyclone ranger
Everyone

That's why I'm turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so 
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so

Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so 
Think so, think so, think so
Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so
