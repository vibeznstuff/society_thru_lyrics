Do ya wanna get rocked? 

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get 
Rocked...... 

I'm your average, ordinary, everyday kid, 
Happy to do nothin' 
In fact that's what I did. 
Got a million ways to make my day, but daddy don't agree 
'Cos when I try to get away he says 
He get plans for me 

Get your butt right out of bed - Stop buggin' me 
Get up and move your sleepy head - Don't shake my tree. 

He said 
Mow the lawn - Who, me? 
Walk the dog - Not my style, man! 
Take out the trash - No way! 
Tidy your room - C'mon get real! 
Sorry dad, gotta disappear, 
Let's get the rock outta here. 

Seven-day weekend, 
Up all night, 
In at the deep end, 
Hang on tight 
Won't take a minute, 
Won't take long, 
So get on in it, 
Come on, come on, come on 

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked 
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked 
Let's go all the way, get it night'n'day 
C'mon let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked. 

I'm your average, ordinary, everyday dude 
Drivin' with my baby, To get her in the mood 
She's dialin'through my radio and I'm ready to make my move, 
But what she got ain't rock'n'roll and it really blew my groove 

It was - Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven 
It makes me wanna scream - Bach, Tchaikovsky, violins 
Turn it off! - That ain't my scene 
Well I'm sorry girl, here's my confession 
I suppose a rock's out of the question? 




Oh, all I wanna do is take a ride into the blue 
Ev'ry time I want to love you I get stuck inside my room 
Heaven knows I'm sick'n'tired of dancin' with this broom 
I feel lucky today 
Hey, look at that man! 
Do ya wanna get rocked? 
Do ya wanna get rocked? 

It won't take you a minute, 
It won't take that long, 
So get on, get with it, 
Oh, c'mon 
Everybody! 

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked 
Get on top, baby 
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked 
Do ya wanna? 
Do ya wanna? 
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked 
Get on top of it 
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked 
Love to rock your body, baby 
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked 
Let's go all the way, 
Let's do it night and day, 
Let's get out and play, 
Rock the night away 
C'mon 
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get (rocked) 
Oh,
