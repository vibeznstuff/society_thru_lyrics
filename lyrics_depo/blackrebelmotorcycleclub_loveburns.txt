Never thought I'd see her go away
She learned I loved her today
Never thought I'd see her cry
And I learned how to love her today
Never thought I'd rather die
Than try to keep her by my side

Now she's gone love burns inside me
Now she's gone love burns inside me
Now she's gone love burns inside me

Nothing else can hurt us now
No loss, our love's been hung on a cross
Nothing seems to make a sound
And now it's all so clear somehow
Nothing really matters now
Now we're gone and on our way

Now she's gone love burns inside me
Now she's gone love burns inside me
Now she's gone love burns inside me

She cuts my skin and bruise my lips
She's everything to me
She tears my clothes and burns my eyes
She's all I want to see
She brings the cold and scars my soul
She's heaven sent to me

Now she's gone love burns inside me
Now she's gone love burns inside me
Now she's gone love burns inside me

Never thought I'd leave you like the way I do, yeah
Kiss my love and I wish you're gone
You can kiss my love and I wish you're gone
Never thought I'd leave you like the way that I do
Kiss my love and I wish you're gone
You can kiss my love and I wish you're gone
Now she's gone love burns inside me
Now she's gone love burns inside me
Now she's gone love burns inside me
