You're the only one that I rely on
A shoulder there for me to cry on
And the hours alone that I'm without you
All I ever do is think about you

No one knows that you're so understanding
Even though my love is so demanding
Everytime you look at me
Then you'll know we'll both agree
That no other love could be

I couldn't live without your love
Now I know you're really mine
I gotta have you all the time

Didn't like you much when I first met you
But somehow I couldn't quite forget you
Said you didn't want a friend or lover
That your life was happy with another
But as time went by my love grew stronger
Knew that I just couldn't wait any longer
For I couldn't let you go
And I had to tell you so
That I loved you, then you'd know

I couldn't live without your love
Now I know you're really mine
I gotta have you all the time

Now the tears are gone and I'm not cryin'
When you say you love me you're not lyin'
So when people want to stare
I know I don't really care
Just as long as you are there

I couldn't live without your love
Now I know you're really mine
I gotta have you all the time
