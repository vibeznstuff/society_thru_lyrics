My girl said goodbye
(My oh my)
My girl didn't cry
(I wonder why?)

(Silly boy) Told my girl we had to break up
(Silly boy) Hoped that she would call my bluff
(Silly boy) When she said to my surprise
"Big girls don't cry"

(Maybe) I was cruel
(I was cruel)
Baby, I'm a fool
(I'm such a fool)

(Silly girl) Shame on you, your mama said
(Silly girl) Shame on you, you're cryin' in bed
(Silly girl) Shame on you, you told a lie
