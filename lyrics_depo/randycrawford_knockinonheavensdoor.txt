I heard him say, "Momma, take this badge offa me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark, too dark to see
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door"

Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
(Well, I feel I'm knockin')
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
(Ooh, yes I feel it)

Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door

He said, "I'm gonna put my guns into the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That large black cloud is coming down
And I feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door"

Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
(Yeah)
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
(I feel I'm knockin')

Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
(I feel I'm knockin')
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door

Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
(I feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door)
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
(Yes, I feel I'm knock knockin)

Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
(Oh yes, I'm knockin')
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
