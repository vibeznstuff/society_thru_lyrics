Oh woman you make me feel
Like I'm on fire
Oh woman you make it real
It's the only way for me
So if we sometimes fight
Doesn't mean we got problems
Ain't always black and white
'n who cares anyway?

Doesn't have to be serious
Doesn't have to be serious
Serious
Doesn't have to be serious
Doesn't have to be serious

Oh baby you get so wild
Too much understanding
Oh baby you're such a child
Full up with on love and tears and cryin'
Don't worry if you're confused
We all tend to be sometimes
The whole world is getting used
That's just the way it is...

May be right, ooh it may be wrong
Doesn't have to be serious
Being hard isn't being strong
Doesn't have to be serious
Fighting for love, fighting for pain
Doesn't have to be serious
And if you win, oh what do you gain?
Doesn't have to be serious

Ooh, doesn't have to be serious
Maybe right, oh but maybe wrong
Doesn't have to be serious
Fighting for love, fighting for pain
Doesn't have to be serious
And if you win, oh what do you gain?
Doesn't have to be serious
Maybe right, oh but maybe wrong
Doesn't have to be serious
Being hard, isn't being strong
