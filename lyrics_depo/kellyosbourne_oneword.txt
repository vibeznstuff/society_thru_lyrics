One word breaks the code of silence, 
Silence tells me all I need to know. 
One Word, 
One Word, tells me everything I need to know. 

One world driven in to madness, 
Madness driven by the depths below. 
One Word, 
One Word, tells me everything I need to know 

 
It's not the way that I want it, 
It's just the way that I need it. 
Day after day 
It's not the way that I want it, 
It's just the way that I need it. 
Day after day 

One lie tells a thousand stories, 
The greatest stories that were ever told. 
One Lie, 
One Lie, tells the greatest stories ever told. 

One man can predict the future, 
a future journey in to outer space. 
One Man, 
One Man, a future journey in to outer space.
