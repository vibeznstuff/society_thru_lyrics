Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, little devil
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, little devil

Hey, little devil, you're always running around (hey, little devil)
It's time that someone started bringing you down (hey, little devil)
There'll be (there'll be) some changes made
Your roving days are through
Hey, little devil, I'm gonna make an angel out of you

Hey, little devil, you got me all in a whirl (hey, you little devil)
You're a cute little devil and I'm gonna make you my girl (hey, you little devil)
A-you're out (you're out) to break a-my heart
But just before you do
Hey, little devil, I'm gonna make an angel out of you

They say beware
But I don't care
I love you just the same
You're an old heartbreaker and a mischief maker
But I'm wise to your name

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey, little devil, everything is gonna be fine (hey, little devil)
Cause someday soon I'm gonna make you all mine (hey, you little devil)
There'll be (there'll be) no running around
You met your Waterloo
Hey, little devil, I'm gonna make an angel out of you

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey, little devil, everything is gonna be fine (hey, little devil)
A-cause someday soon I'm-a gonna make you all mine (hey, you little devil)
There'll be (there'll be) no running around
You met your Waterloo
Hey, little devil, I'm gonna make an angel out of you

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, little devil
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, little devil
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, little devil
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, little devil
