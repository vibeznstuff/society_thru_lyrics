I steal the night away,
Driving my life away, dancing.
I was a Romeo,
I knew the art of romancing.
I was just one of the guys
And I thought I had it made.
I needed someone to show me how to love.

Juliet, oh Juliet,
The night was magic when we first met.
Juliet, oh Juliet,
You know you taught me to fly.
You take me clear to the sky.
And all the people around the world can stand aside
For me and my baby, Juliet.

Fighting with destiny,
Fortune and fame but kept losing.
Playing a joker's game,
Only myself I was fooling.

I was an average guy
In a world of empty dreams.
You've broken down all the walls
With your love.

Juliet, oh Juliet,
This kind of loving you don't forget.
Juliet, oh Juliet,
You know you taught me to fly.
You take me clear to the sky.
And all the people around the world can stand aside.

Close your eyes, Juliet, don't let go.

On and on, our love is like the sun.
It keeps going strong throughout eternity.

I wanna love you in my life, sweet Juliet.
Living without you in my life, oh my girl Juliet.

Juliet, oh Juliet,
This kind of loving you don't forget.
Juliet, oh Juliet,
You know you taught me to fly.
You take me clear to the sky.
And all the people around the world can stand aside.

Juliet, oh Juliet,
This kind of loving you don't forget.
Juliet, oh Juliet, ah...
Juliet, oh Juliet...
