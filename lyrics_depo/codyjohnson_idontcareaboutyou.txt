Here's the truth, I refuse to argue with you baby
Can't tell you what to do but I'm not some johnny come late
So there's the door you can walk right through
Cause tonight I don't care about losing you


Oh tonight I don't care about trying to make things right
And I'm just not in the mood and I'm damn sure not gonna fight tonight
And if this is some kind of premonition of how it's gonna be with you
I'm out, I'm done baby I'm through 'cause tonight I don't care about you

So there it is, that's all that needs to be said baby
I don't care about your friends and what they seem to think that you need lately
If you don't want to believe me, I guess I'm every bit of the jerk that you say I am
But tonight I don't give a damn



Well it's not to say that tomorrow morning I won't change my mind
But tonight you better listen to my warning I need a little time



There it is that's all that needs to be said baby
