Can't run you can't run away
But don't give yourself up
To the waiting game
You've taken every step
And made all the moves
But you're still where you were
You think you're going under

Come out tonight in your true colours
Stand in the light in your true colours

Shut down
Shut out the warning signs
Whatever it takes to get off the line
You should be looking out
For number one
Another point of view
A new star shining for you

And when you break down
Don't let it show
You hold your future in your hands
Don't let go

Too late.
It's never too late to learn
The lion is sleeping in everyone
You must be strong enough
To go all the way
Remember where you were
Don't let yourself go under
