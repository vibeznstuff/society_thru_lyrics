When the words that you wanted to say are all coming out wrong,
When you burst into tears, though you're trying so hard to be strong,

Oh
We're standing in,
The line of fire,
Trying to make two wrongs right,

Hurt lovers,
Hurt, hurt lovers oh,
Don't give up,
Don't, don't give up, no,
Take cover,
You can't just let it go,
We gotta try,
We gotta try,

So when all that you ever believed comes apart at the seams,
And when all of the bridges you build wash away in a stream,

Oh,
Whatever comes,
It's not the end,
We gotta fight,
And take a stand

Hurt lovers,
Hurt, hurt lovers oh,
Don't give up,
Don't, don't give up, no,
Take cover,
You can't just let it go,
We gotta try,
We gotta try,

Hurt lovers,
Hurt so bad and then
You find something
To make things right again
It don't matter who wins out in the end
We gotta try,
We gotta try,

Even when you lose heart,
And you've played your last card (you know)
You know, you know,

We're standing in,
The line of fire,
Trying to make two wrongs right,

Hurt lovers,
Hurt, hurt lovers oh,
Don't give up,
Don't, don't give up, no,
We gotta try,
We gotta try,

Hurt lovers,
Hurt, hurt lovers oh,
Don't give up,
Don't, don't give up, no,
Take cover,
You can't just let it go,
We gotta try,
We gotta try,

Hurt lovers,
Hurt so bad and then
You find something
To make things right again
It don't matter who wins out in the end
We gotta try,
We gotta try,
