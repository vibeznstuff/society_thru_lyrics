Last night, quietly, she walked through my mind
As I lay searching for sleep.
Her soft hand reached out, she whispered my name
As she brushed a tear from my cheek.
And then those funny familiar forgotten feelings 
started walkin' all over my mind.
It's sad, so sad to watch love go bad, 
but a true love would not have gone wrong.
I'm just thankful for the good times we've had 
for without them I could not go on,
With all these funny familiar forgotten feelings 
walkin' all over my mind. 
I must go on, be strong, 
tho' a million teardrops may fall,
Before these funny familiar forgotten feelings 
stop walk' all over my mind.
