Reggie 'n' Bollie, eh-yeah

I've got the Netflix
Do you wanna chill?
Maybe it's stupid, but you give me them thrills
'Cause I've got the hot line (that's right)
Can you make it bling? (alright)
Oh, I'm going crazy when you're doing your thing

So I gotta get you you
Girl, you're the truth
All of your moves
Gonna blow my fuse
Say you you, raisin' the roof
Turning up the place
You you, burn out the roof
All of your moves
Gonna blow my fuse
Baby, you're the girl
Baby, you're the girl

I got a new girl,
No one hotter in the whole world
This time maybe I won't mess it up
No, no, no, no, oh, oh, oh
'Cause I've got a new chick
She's so hot she makes my heart skip
This time maybe I won't mess it up
No, no, no, no, oh, oh, oh

I've got the mainland,
But you've got the world
We'll light up the universe if you were my girl
But just like Beyonc√©, and I'ma be your Jay
Oh, let's get drunk in love and do it our way

So I gotta get you you
Girl, you're the truth
All of your moves
Gonna blow my fuse
Say you you, raisin' the roof
Turning up the place

I got a new girl,
No one hotter in the whole world
This time maybe I won't mess it up
No, no, no, no, oh, oh, oh
'Cause I've got a new chick
She's so hot she makes my heart skip
This time maybe I won't mess it up
Oh, oh, oh

(Brand new!)


Eh-yo, let's go home and play Nintendo
She make my heart go mental
She make my whole life change


I got a new girl,
No one hotter in the whole world
This time maybe I won't mess it up
(Mess it up, mess it up baby)
No, no, no, no, oh, oh, oh
'Cause I've got a new chick
She's so hot she makes my heart skip
This time maybe I won't mess it up
No, no, no, no, oh, oh, oh
