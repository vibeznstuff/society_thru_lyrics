I can feel your heart beat when I'm all alone
I can feel your heart beat like it's my own

I can hear your music from a million miles away
The angels got it right when they made you
The way they made you
Sometimes I wonder if you're made from bones and skin
Or are you something for me to begin again, again

This love, this love
This love, this love

I will build you a mountain
So you can see
All the away across the universe to me

I will build you shelter for when the days are cold
I will be your shelter for when were old and kind

This love, this love, this love, this love
This love, this love, this love, this love
