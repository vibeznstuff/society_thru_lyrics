If they'd ever have told me
That I'd find true love in every way
Would I cry 'till tomorrow?
Would I keep the non-believers away?

Remember that late night last September
When you held me in your arms so tight
I was feeling kind of low, my heart was blue
I was empty 'till you came
But oh what a...

Saturday night
Things were going right
As right as they'd ever been
I know that you love me

If they'd ever have told me
That I'd find true love in every way
Would I cry till tomorrow?
Would I keep the non-believers away?
Was I shy, was I good with this foolish heart?
Did I try to deny we would fall apart?

Like a knight in shining armour you came over to save me
What a bolt out of the blue (blue)
Just one look into those eyes
You had me fallen completely
(Head over heels in love with you)
But oh what a...

Saturday night
Things were going right (I love saturday)
As right as they'd ever been
I know that you love me

If they'd ever have told me
That I'd find true love in every way
Would I cry to tomorrow
Would I keep the non-belivers away?
Was I shy, was I good, with this foolish heart?
Did I try to deny we would fall apart?

And you saw me
I was falling (head over heels in love with you)
Saturday night
Things were going right (I love saturday)
As right as they'd ever be
I know that you love me

If they'd ever have told me
That I'd find true love in every way (every way)
Would I cry to tomorrow? (cry to tomorrow?)
Would I keep the non-believers away? (non-believers away oohhhhh)
Was I shy, was I good, with this foolish heart? (was I shy oooohhhh was I good)
Did I try to deny we would fall apart? (I love saturday)

If they'd ever have told me
That I'd find true love in every way
Would I cry to tomorrow
Would I keep the non-believers away?
Was I shy, was I good, with this foolish heart?
Did I try to deny we would fall
Did I try to deny we would fall ap..
Did I try to deny we would fall apart?
