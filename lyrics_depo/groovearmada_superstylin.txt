Enter in de dance, plug it in an we begin
Crowd up in de center, they watch fi de rydim 
Watch the way we drop it in a mix timin
Rise and amplifyin when we come in wit de swin
Just followin the back an naturally harmonizin
Climb into position wit synchronized things
Live from out a ghetto, We maximizin
Sound of the Groove Armada
We Superstylin... we superstylin... we superstylin

Sometime... Can you feel de pressure does unwind
Sometime...
Sometime... Trough de day and trough de night
Sometime...
Sometime... You can make our pressure does unwind
Sometime...
Sometime... Its for your spirit and your mind
Sometime...

That's how we drop it on de up on de line
One time lyrics that must stick on your mind
Pop a bass line, I'll go prop and provide
My MC super, I'll go double on de right...

Sometime... Can you feel de pressure does unwind
Sometime...
Sometime... Trough de day and trough de night
Sometime...
Sometime... You can make our pressure does unwind
Sometime...
Sometime... Its for your spirit and your mind
Sometime...

Baby let's recline...
