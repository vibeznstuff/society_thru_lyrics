Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 

Oh baby 
Can we sit down and talk for a minute 
You know that we've got a few things 
We need to work out, oh yeah 
You can, spare me all your sorry details 
Had enough of all your lies 
And my silence cries 

Hurry, hurry, quick, quick 
I need a man who's gonna do me right 
Hurry, hurry, quick, quick 
Somebody who will surely satisfy 
When I think of your love 
It only makes me stop and wonder 
Truly why, oh why 
Oh, Why would you make me cry, oh baby 

5 miles to empty 
My heart is running low, whoa 
I need a good man to fill me up 
I need a good man to give me love, babe 
5 miles to empty 
My heart is running low, whoa 
I need a good man to fill me up 
I need a good man to give me love 

We spend so much time 
We're always fighting desperately trying for love 
We know won't last much longer, no, no, but baby 
Such a waste of time when we're praying though 
Some are saying that we won't last much longer than a day 
No, no, no, no, no 

Hurry, hurry, quick, quick 
I need a man who's gonna do me right 
Hurry, hurry, quick, quick 
Somebody who is gonna satisfy my needs, yeah 
When I think of your love 
It only makes me stop and wonder 
Truly why, oh why 
Oh, why would you make me cry, oh baby 

5 miles to empty 
My heart is running low, whoa 
I need a good man to fill me up 
I need a good man to give me love, babe 
5 miles to empty 
My heart is running low, whoa 
I need a good man to fill me up 
I need a good man to give me love 

5 miles to a empty 
My heart is running low 

5 miles to empty 
My heart is running low 

Hurry, hurry, quick, quick 
Oh, I need a man who will promise to always do right 
Hurry, hurry, quick, quick 
Oh, looking for someone who's gonna satisfy 
When I think of your love 
It only makes me stop and wonder 
Truly why, oh why 
Why would you make me cry, oh baby 

5 miles to empty
