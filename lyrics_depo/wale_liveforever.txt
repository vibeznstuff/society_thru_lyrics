Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh


I got so much to live for
So much to share
Could take a look in the mirror
And there's no one else to care
I got so much to live for
So much to give
I don't care if we take forever
Forever I'll live


See my future in my daughter's eyes
And at 45, woulda thought of making my daughter cry
It's real hitters in the district that know me the best
Grew up with some men that's homeless and smoking that wet
Hoping they closer to death
I'm totally over focused and don't you forget
The so-and-so's they put over me, know I'm the best
I'm blessed with the bars, shawty this is God work
I made some A&amp;Rs rich off of hard work
They killing men and they innocent but they killing many
That badge of honor just not enough to conceal they feelings
They offing all us that's just what I'm a tell my daughter partner
Study in school, watch out for cooties in the law department
Hey, I coulda kept my scholarship but hey
And I could have been a robber couldn't I have? Yeah
A 4.5 40, or a 45 40, either way I run for my defense


I got so much to live for
So much to share
Could take a look in the mirror
And there's no one else to care
I got so much to live for
So much to give
I don't care if we take forever
Forever I'll live


Another bragger, money don't make ya boy
And lil Chad struggle with makers boy
So I ain't waiting for no reparations
Man who got the patience
Just pay attention, I make my statements, boy
Well, you young and black, you may be lacking motivation
Unless you run or shoot a basket, women out here naked
1 in every 20 of 'em doing good though
That's not a stat, that's actually out my phone book
And I pray tonight night because they hate us and know it
I'm a pray tonight homie my lil baby don't know it
I'm a hold on tight homie for every weapon they folding
How can all lives matter if it's only brothers that's mourning?
Haah, yeah
BLM till we see the end
See I was sort of sleeping until I seen the debt man
Numbers exceed the limit
And now I see it different
Ain't willing to die for it? At least breathe it in


I got so much to live for
So much to share
Could take a look in the mirror
And there's no one else to care
I got so much to live for
So much to give
I don't care if we take forever
Forever I'll live

I got so much to live for
