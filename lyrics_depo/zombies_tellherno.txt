And if she should tell you "come closer"
And if she tempts you with her charms

Tell her no  no  no  no  no-no-no-no
No  no  no  no  no-no-no-no
No no no no no
Don't hurt me now for her love belongs to me

And if she should tell you "I love you", whoa-oh-oh
And if she tempts you with her charms

Tell her no  no  no  no  no-no-no-no
No  no  no  no  no-no-no-no
(Don't let her love for your arms)
No no no no no
Don't hurt me now for her love belongs to me

I know she's a kind of girl
Who'd throw my love away
But I still love her so
Don't hurt me now, don't hurt me now

If she tells you "I love you" whoa-oh-oh
Just remember she said that to me

Tell her no  no  no  no  no-no-no-no
No  no  no  no  no-no-no-no
(Don't take her love from my arms)
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Don't leave me now for her love belongs to me
