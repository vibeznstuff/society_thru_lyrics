The marchin' band came down along Maine Street
The soldier-blues fell in behind
I looked across and there I saw Billy
Waiting to go and join the line

And with her head upon his shoulder
His young and lovely fiancee
From where I stood I saw she was cryin'
And through her tears I heard her say:

"Billy, don't be a hero, don't be a fool with your life
Billy, don't be a hero, come back and make me your wife"
And as Billy started to go she said: "Keep your pretty head low
Billy, don't be a hero, come back to me"

The soldier-blues were trapped on a hillside
The battle raging all around
The sergeant cried: "We've gotta hang on, boys
We've gotta hold this piece of ground

I need a volunteer to ride out
And bring us back some extra men"
And Billy's hand was up in a moment
Forgettin' all the words she said. She said:

"Billy, don't be a hero, don't be a fool with your life
Billy, don't be a hero, come back and make me your wife"
And as Billy started to go she said: "Keep your pretty head low
Billy, don't be a hero, come back to me"

I heard his fiancee got a letter
That told how Billy died that day
The letter said that he was a hero
She should be proud he died that way
I heard she threw the letter away
