I know you come a long way, baby
But you don't need that heart of stone, no
You proved that you could do it, do it, baby
You could make it on your own

But you can't keep runnin' away from love
'Cause the first one let you down, no, no, no
And though others try to satisfy you, baby
With me true love can still be found
Love can still be found

The second time around
Ooh, the second time is so much better, baby
The second time around
And I'll make it better than the first time

You know I really love you
And I paid for my mistakes, yes, I did, girl
The more I try to hide my feelings, baby
This old heart gets in the way
And love won't let me wait

The second time around
Girl, with me it's better than the first time
The second time around
Let's do it one more time, say it again

The second time around
All that I've been through, I'll do it again just as long as I'm
With you
The second time around
Ho... the second time

You can't keep runnin' away from move
'Cause the first one let you down
And though others try to satisfy you, baby
With me true love can still be found

The second time around
I'm gonna keep you mine the second time, baby
The second time around
I'll know what to do just as long as I'm with you

The second time around
Do it one more time, say it again
The second time around
I'm gonna keep you mine the second time, baby

The second time around
So in love, so in love
The second time around
Oh... ho...

The second time around
Oh...
The second time around

Ooh... ooh... ooh...
I'll make it so good to you, babe
I make it so good to you

Not like the first time (Not like the first time)
Not like the first time (Not like the first time)
Not like the first time
Talking 'bout the second time
