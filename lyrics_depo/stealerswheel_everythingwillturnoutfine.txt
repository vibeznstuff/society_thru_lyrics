Riding on the subway watching all the people stare,
Everyone just listens, they won't do any talking, oh no, whoa no.
They just sit there waitin', waitin' with their eyes
Don't ask any questions, you won't get an answer, oh no, whoa no.

Everybody seems to have a good time,
Nobody goes stepping out of line,
Everyone's agreed that everything will turn out fine.

Moving through the city, making all the rounds,
Trying different places, didn't like the faces, oh no, whoa no.
Rollin' in the gutter, throwin' up my pride,
Belly full of whiskey, was it hard to swallow? Oh no, whoa no.

Everybody seems to have a good time,
Nobody goes stepping out of line,
Everyone's agreed that everything will turn out fine.

Everybody seems to have a good time,
Nobody goes stepping out of line,
Everyone's agreed that everything will turn out fine.
