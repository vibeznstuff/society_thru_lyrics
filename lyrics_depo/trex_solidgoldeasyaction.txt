Life is the same
And it always will be
Easy as picking foxes from a tree

(Heh heh heh)

But I can't get no satisfaction
All I want is easy action

(Heh heh heh)
(Heh heh heh)

A stud is a lamb
With the thoughts of a tiger

(Heh heh heh)

Who moves like a cat
And knows how to ride her

(Heh heh heh)

But I can't get no satisfaction
All I want is easy action, baby

(Heh heh heh)

Stroll on
I can't get no satisfaction
All I want is easy action

(Heh heh heh)
(Heh heh heh)

A woman from the east with her headlights shining

(Heh heh heh)

Eased my pain and stopped my crying

(Heh heh heh)

But I can't get no satisfaction
All I want is easy action, baby

(Heh heh heh)
(Heh heh heh)

And all my hair will keep her smiling
With my wondrous walk and my telephone dialing
But I can't get no satisfaction
All I want is easy action, baby

(Heh heh heh)
(Heh heh heh)

I know you're shrewd and she's a dude
But all I want is easy action
I know you're shrewd and she's a dude
But all I want is easy action
I know you're shrewd and she's a dude
But all I want is easy action, baby

(Heh heh heh)

Stroll on
