Once they killed his monster when it went into a trap
now he's making better ones on a higher step


On a warm summer day the doctor went away
to a place where he could make it real
his assistant's hips were nice
so he cloned her once or twice
now his hips are aching what a deal


Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
lets them run into the night
they become
 great rock musicians
 great politicians
 a great possession
 a great oppression

Sometimes when he's feeling bored
he's calling it a day
he's got his computers and they do it their own way


They mix some DNA, some skina and a certain spray
you can watch it on a laser screen
and the fellow's blue and grey
or sometimes pink and green
just check it out on Halloween


Dr. Stein grows funny creatures. . .




One night he cloned himself
put his brother on a shelf
but when he fell asleep that night
it crept up from behind and thought "well never mind"
took a syringe and blew out his life
