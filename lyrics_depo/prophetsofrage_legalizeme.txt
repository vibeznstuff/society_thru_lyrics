They smoke in Colorado
They smoke in Cali too
They smoke all night
But that's alright
We still fight on tomorrow

If you come down to SoCal
Roll one, maybe two
Fly to the bay
Come back to L.A.
And we can medicate tomorrow

Get free, get free, come on
Legalize me
Get free, get free, yeah
Legalize me
Get free, get free, uh
Legalize me
Legalize me, legalize me
Get excited

They smoke up in Toronto
They smoke in Portland too
We feel alright
All day and night
But we fight on tomorrow

Get free, get free, come on
Legalize me
Get free, get free, yeah
Legalize me
Get free, get free, uh
Legalize me
Legalize me, legalize me
Get free

Alright! 

Young widows candles lit
Teenagers blown to bits
Unfriendly radio hits
Prime nights at The Ritz

Loyalists White House liars
Thinning ice, balding tires
Silver spoons, chicken pox
At midnight we turn back the clocks

Feel the Bern burn the fire
Make the law realize it
Open eyes to land and skies
Where violence is authorized

Turntables apple pie
Cluster bombs Kentucky-fried
Kill all the lights, out go the tide
Need a break, legalize

Get free, get free, hey
Legalize me
Get free, get free, come on
Legalize me
Get free, get free, yeah
Legalize me
Legalize me, legalize me
Get free

Get free, get free
Legalize
Get free, get free
Legalize
Get free, get free
Legalize
Get free, get free, get free
