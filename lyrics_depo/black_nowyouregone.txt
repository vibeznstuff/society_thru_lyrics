Well now, you
Wouldn't stay
And there's not much more that I can say
But your lips
That I kissed
Will never go away
From my memory
They will remain with me.
You were tied, now you're gone,
There was time, now it's gone.
Is this the best
We can do?
Have we come as far as we intend to?
This was comedy,
It is true,
I was not innocent under you.
Ah my memories,
They will remain with me.
You were tied, now you're gone,
There was time, now it's gone,
Now it's gone.
You were tied, now you're gone,
There was time, now it's gone,
Now it's gone.
Ah my memories,
They will remain with me.
You were tied, now you're gone,
There was time, now it's gone,
Now it's gone.
You were tied, now you're gone,
There was time, now it's gone,
Now it's gone, now it's gone.
