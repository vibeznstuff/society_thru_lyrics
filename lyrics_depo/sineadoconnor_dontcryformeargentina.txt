It won't be easy
you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love
After all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl
you once knew
Although she's dressed up
to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen
I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life
Down at heel
Looking out of the window
Staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around trying
everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it too

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune
And as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world
They were all I desired
They are illusions
They are not the solutions
they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more
I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is
look at me
To know that every word is true

I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
