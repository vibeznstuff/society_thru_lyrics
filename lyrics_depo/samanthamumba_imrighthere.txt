Back in the day I did not know
What to look for in my new beau
So, I would just settle for guys I should never
Even have dated but now I know better
Because I’m experienced all types of relationships
I know what I need, so I shall just lead
My dream guy into real life with me


I'm looking for a guy to play the lead in my life
I’m sure that in good time that I will find my Mr. Right


To all the good men who are out there all the single ladies wanna know where
So put your hands up in the air and say I'm right here

To all the good men who are out there all the single ladies wanna know where
So put your hands up in the air and say I'm right here

He's got a good style beautiful smile
Wears that cologne that drives women wild
Takes more than just looks to get me shook
If he catches my mind, he’ll have me hooked
When a guy with intelligence, a perfect gentlemen
Could be more than a lover be more than a man
A guy who could be my best friend 


I'm looking for a guy to play the lead in my life
I’m sure that in good time that I will find my mr. right


To all the good men who are out there all the single ladies wanna know where
So put your hands up in the air and say I'm right here

To all the good men who are out there all the single ladies wanna know where
So put your hands up in the air and say I'm right here

I wanna know where
Could they be over there 
No theyre right here 
I think they're over there
I wanna know where 
I think they're over here 
I know they're here somewhere
I know that I could fan out there  


Do your dance begin ay well I sing to a man without a fun cun job
Sing to them about makeup with a lot of red dots 
She sum only love physical conduct she needs a lot of makeup
Lot a six maybe lot put the leaves in your jeans and a dry on your butt

Teredoct this sure is the part I love
