I feel these four walls closing in
My face up against the glass I'm looking out
Is this my life I'm wondering?
It happened so fast

How do I turn this thing around?
Is this the bed I chose to make?
It's greener pastures I'm thinking about
Wide open spaces far away

All I want is the wind in my hair
To face the fear but not feel scared

Wild horses, I wanna be like you
Throwing caution to the wind
I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love, like I'm longing to
I wanna run with the wild horses, run with the wild horses!

I see the girl I wanna be
Riding bare-back, care-free along the shore
If only that someone was me
Jumping head-first headlong without a thought

To act and damn the consequence
How I wish it could be that easy
But fear surrounds me like a fence
I wanna break free

All I want is the wind in my hair
To face the fear but not feel scared

Wild horses, I wanna be like you
Throwing caution to the wind
I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love, like I'm longing to
I wanna run with the wild horses, run with the wild horses!

I wanna run too

Recklessly abandoning myself before you
I wanna open up my heart, tell him how I feel

Wild horses, I wanna be like you
Throwing caution to the wind
I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love, like I'm longing to
I wanna run with the wild horses, run with the wild horses, run with the wild horses

I wanna run with the wild horses
