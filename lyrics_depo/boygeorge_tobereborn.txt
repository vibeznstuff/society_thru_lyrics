Get off your knees
Don't apologise
Cause I ain't got no time
For no more lies
You know the answer
I gave it to you
But you carry on
With the things that you do
Yes I have tried
I could live
I could die
I could be reborn - in your arms
I, I could laugh
I could cry
I could sigh if you're there
Keep me warm
Talk to me
Open your eyes
Talk to me
Loose the disguise
We had good love
Most of the time
Give it back
That love is mine
Give it back
Just one more time
I know the answer
What can we do
I know the answer
So do you
I gave you love
I gave it to you
I gave you love - something new
I gave you love
