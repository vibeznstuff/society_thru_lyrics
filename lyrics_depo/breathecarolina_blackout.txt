Cut up and I can't feel my hands
No need to chase
Can you relate?
Can you keep up the pace like you're dying for this?

And when you say "I'm not okay"
I left my phone in the cab
Now you can't get mad
I'm only getting started

I won't blackout
This time I've got nothing to waste
Let's go a little harder
I'm on fire
I won't blackout
I'm on my way
I'm only getting started

And I can't see your face
Cigarette the wrong way
Inhale to the top of my lungs
I've been dying for this

And when you say "I'm not okay"
I left my phone in the cab
Now you can't get mad
I'm only getting started

I won't blackout
This time I've got nothing to waste
Let's go a little harder
I'm on fire
I won't blackout
I'm on my way
I'm only getting started

I won't blackout
This time I've got nothing to waste
Let's go a little harder
I'm on fire
I won't blackout
I'm on my way
I'm only getting started

This won't stop till I say so
This won't stop till I say so
This won't stop till I say so
Going and going and going and going and go, go

This won't stop till I say so
This won't stop till I say so
This won't stop till I say so
Going and going and going and going and go
I'm only getting started

I won't blackout
This time I've got nothing to waste
Let's go a little harder
I'm on fire
I won't blackout
I'm on my way
I'm only getting started

I won't blackout
This time I've got nothing to waste
Let's go a little harder
I'm on fire
I won't blackout
I'm on my way
I'm only getting started

This won't stop till I say so
This won't stop till I say so
This won't stop till I say so
Going and going and going and going and go
I'm only getting started

This won't stop till I say so
This won't stop till I say so
This won't stop till I say so
Going and going and going and going and go
I'm only getting started
