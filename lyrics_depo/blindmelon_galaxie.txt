Is this the place that I want to be
Is it you who I want to see
Holding on, hold it high, show me everything
And you're leaving me, yeah you're leaving me
you're leaving me with a hated identity

But I keep on a comin' here and standing in this state
And I'm never really sure if you'll take what I'm saying the right way
But I'm not appalled or afraid verbal pocket play
Is as discreet as I can muster up to be
Because the Cadillac that's sittin' in the back
It isn't me
Oh, no, no, no it isn't me
I'm more at home in my galaxie

Can I do the things I wanna do
That I don't do because of you
And I'll take a left and I'll second
guess into a total mess

And you're leaving me
And you're leaving me
you're leaving me with a hated identity

No no no no it isn't me
No no no no it isn't me
No it isn't me
I'm more at home in my galaxie
