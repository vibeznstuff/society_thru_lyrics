Why dont you fool me, feed me, say you need me without wicked games
Come on and hold me, hug me, say you love me, and not my dirty brain
Why don't you fool me, feed me, say you need me ,without wicked games
Come on and hold me, hug me, say you love me, and not my dirty brain

I got one Alabama return
that'll take me far away from you
cause when you take me in your arms I turn to slave but I cant be saved


So I got my cappuchino to go and I’m heading for the hills again
Cause if we party anymore we'll start a fire of pure desire
Closer ,your minds firing blind
With your head in your face getting red in your heart beats ,closer
you fall on your knees and the geek at your feet says your neat
and the beat gets closer
You dive for the thrill at the kill and your heart’s had its fill
But it still creeps closer
You wanted to freeze but your weak in too deep and the beat and the beat gets closer


Closer Closer Closer Closer Closer Closer Closer
We give it up and then they take it away
A girl’s got to zip it up
And get her head in the shade
Baby we give it up
Its just a matter of time
Throw all the heavy stuff
Comes back to bite your behind


You can’t mistake my Biology


The way that we talk
The way that we walk
its there in our thoughts


The magic number is in front of me


The way that we talk
The way that we walk
so easily caught


You can’t mistake my Biology


The way that we talk
The way that we walk
its there in our thoughts


We’re gonna cause a controversy


The way that we talk
The way that we walk
so easily caught


Why don't you fool me, feed me say, you need me without wicked games
Come on and hold me, hug me, say you love me, and not my dirty brain
Why don't you fool me, feed me, say you need me without wicked games
Come on and hold me, love me, say you love me, and not my dirty brain
