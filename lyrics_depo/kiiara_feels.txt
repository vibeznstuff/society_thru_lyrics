And I got way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real, I just say fuck it, keep on going
And I get deeper, I get deeper, yeah I feel I'm rolling
I can see you, yeah I see you
I don't know I think I'm rolling
Yeah it's way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real, I just say fuck it, keep on going
And I get deeper, I get deeper, yeah I think I'm rolling
I can see you, yeah I see him
I don't know I just keep on going

And I got way too many feels, way too much emotion
All this Xans inside my body, I say fuck it keep on drowning
You can bring a juice I'll match you
Yeah you mix it, pour the potion
I don't know who you are, but I'd dive into your ocean
Yeah you say you smoking grams, I'm smoking into the Grammys
You say you got them bars, but all I see is candy
Still you came through so low-key, think you understand, I don't know me
Still I get along with your best friends, even better with your family

I got way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real, I just say fuck it, keep on going
And I get deeper, I get deeper, yeah I think I'm rolling
If you see him, yeah I see him
I don't know I just keep going

Yeah I have way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real, I just say fuck it, keep on going
I got all I need, you don't know what I mean
Yeah we pour up 'til we go up
And I got way too many feels, not enough to forfeit
So many fuckin' bands, so you know we finna blow it
We be faded when I'm sober, sober when I'm faded
Over scrutinized by all your counterparts there's no debating

You say it's cause they jaded, yeah they jealous that I made it
Do you remember that first time I missed you in the basement?
Back when we really didn't known it, we were searching for some
Now they pay full advance, and there ain't no fucking discussion
At the stage they jumping because it's like that
You see all these chicks and now your girl ain't even write back
You drink all my rose, and you know what to do
Someone dropped up a dose, so we finna get screwed

You know I got like way too many feels, way too much emotion
Don't know how to make you feel, but I'm sorry bitch I'm flowing
You know I just drop top in that coupe, zoom, don't know where you been at, true,
now I'm searching for who, you, yeah I'm coming right back

And I got way too many feels
Way too many feels
