Goodbye to the sky, 
I know I can't fly, but I feel love 
do you know how I feel? 
you are my achilles heel. 
hello to below, I feel love flow 
like a river flow 
you and I standing still 
you are my achilles heel. 

feeling free, yeah, what about me? 
well you gotta give it up cos I feel love 
do you know how I feel? 
you are my achilles heel 
goodbye to the sky 
I know I can't fly, but I feel love 
do you know how I feel? 
you are my achilles heel. 

for there's a child in your eyes 
and the child never dies 
so keep the dream alive 
with the aid of second sight 
I can push with all my might 
to make a statue in the sky 
of my achilles heel 

small fry, don't know why 
gotta get high - just to love life 
you are my highs and lows 
from my head to my toes 
I said hey la, will I go far? 
will I go far - cos I love life 
do you know how I feel? 
you are my achilles heel 
I said oh no no, will I go slow? 
will I go slow, when the feeling flows 

for there's a child in your eyes 
and the child never dies 
so keep the dream alive 
with the aid of second sight 
I can push with all my might 
o make the satue in the sky 
of my achilles heel 

well you're feeling free 
so what about me? 
I said hello and goodbye but I don't know why 
well while we're small fry 
on the line 
with my achilles heel
