She's blood, flesh and bone
No tucks or silicone
She's touch, smell, sight, taste, and sound
But somehow I can't believe
That anything should happen
I know where I belong
And nothing's going to happen, yeah

'Cause she's so high
High above me
She's so lovely
She's so high
Like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
Da da-da da da
She's so high
High above me

First class and fancy free
She's high society
She's got the best of everything
What could a guy like me
Ever really offer?
She's perfect as she can be
Why should I even bother?

'Cause she's so high
High above me
She's so lovely
She's so high
Like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
Da da-da da da
She's so high
High above me

She calls to speak to me
I freeze immediately
'Cause what she says sounds so unreal
'Cause somehow I can't believe
That anything should happen
I know where I belong
And nothing's going to happen, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause she's so high
High above me
She's so lovely
She's so high
Like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite, oh yeah
She's so high
High above me
