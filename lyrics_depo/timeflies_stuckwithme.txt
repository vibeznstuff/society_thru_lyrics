Open up the shades, sun is on the way
Come over here and lay, what are you afraid of?
Expressions on your face easily explained
You worried 'bout the fame, I won't let it change us

And I won't tell you no lie (Don't you worry...)
'Cause baby you are stuck, you are stuck with me

Thank God everyday for how you were made
Naturally engaged, you don't need the make-up (No, no)
Every curve and shape I could illustrate
Your body on the page, I cannot erase the love (Yeah)

And I won't tell you no lie (Don't you worry...)
'Cause baby, you are stuck, you are stuck with me

At first you try to fight it
Feelings you could find no way of hidin'
And then you're always worried 'bout the timin'
Is it right?

But you know that you're always on my mind and
To tell you the truth, well I'd be lyin'
If I didn't tell you baby, you know I'm in this for life
(In this for life)

'Cause baby you are stuck (stuck), you are stuck (are stuck), you are stuck with me

Open up the shades, sun is on the way...
