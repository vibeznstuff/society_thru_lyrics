I was young (BOP)
And didn't have no where too run
I needed to (wake up) and see (and see)
What's in front of me (na-na-op)
There had to be, a better way
To show I'm grateful (hum)
So I thought up this song
To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
You don't know much you mean to me


Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank youooo)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)


All through my life
I knew that you'd be my world
Knowing every where I go
Things you taught me they would show
So many times and changes
You've seen me through
I sure enough couldn't have survived without you
And so I thought up this song
To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long...
You don't know howmuch you mean to me
