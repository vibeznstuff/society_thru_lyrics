Come rest you weary gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Lay down your swords and fight no more
For the sake of Christmas Day

A saviour came down to this earth
To show us everyone
How to live in harmony
Together under the sun

Beyond the dark horizon
Lies a far more bountiful land
Void of all starvation
For every woman and man.

So reach out from the wilderness
And pray to heaven above
A future lies in wait for us
A world united in love

We don't need a merry Christmas
We don't need a Happy New Year
The only wish on Santa's list
Is that one day there will be
Peace on this earth

Through the valleys
Over the hills
Church bells echo their sound
Whispers travelling through the trees
Over the snow covered ground
Spread the message far and wide
So every one can hear
Home fires glow on angel wings
And banishes every tear

We don't need a merry Christmas
We don't need a Happy New Year
The only wish on Santa's list
Is that one day there will be
Peace on this earth

Grant us.. one wish
No more.. pain or sorrow
Hear us.. help us
Build a new tommorrow

So reach out from the wilderness
And pray to heaven above
A future lies in wait for us
A world united in love

We don't need a merry Christmas
We don't need a Happy New Year
The only wish on Santa's list
Is that one day there will be

No more tears or pain at Christmas
No more children living in fear
The only wish on Santa's list
Is that one day there will be
One day there will be
One day there will be
Peace on this earth

Grant us.. our wish this Christmas
