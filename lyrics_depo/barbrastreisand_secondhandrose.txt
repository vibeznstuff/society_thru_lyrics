Father has a business strictly second hand
Everything from toothpicks to a baby-grand
Stuff in our apartment came from father's store
Even clothes I'm wearing someone wore before
It's no wonder that I feel abused
I never get a thing that ain't been used
I'm wearing second hand hats
Second hand clothes
That's why they call me
Second hand Rose
Even our piano in the parlor
Daddy bought for ten cents on the dollar
Second hand pearls
I'm wearing second hand curls
I never get a single think that's new
Even Jake, the plumber, he's a man I adore
He had the nerve to tell me he's been married before!
Everyone knows that I'm just
Second hand Rose
From second Avenue!
From Second Avenue!
New?
