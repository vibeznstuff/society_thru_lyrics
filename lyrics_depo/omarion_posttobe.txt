And your chick

If your chick come close to me
She ain't going home where she post to be
I'm getting money like I'm post to be

Ooh, all my niggas close to me
And all them other niggas where they post to be
Ooh, the hoes go for me
Have your chick send a pic like pose for me
That's how it post to be
That's how it post to be
That's how it post to be
Everything good like it post to be


Pull up to the club and it go up
Make your girl fall in love when I show up
It's not my fault she wanna know me
She told me you were just a homie

She came down like she knew me
Gave it up like a groupie
And that's facts, no printer
Cold nigga turn the summer to the winter
She save me in her phone as bestie
But I had her screaming, oohh
Yo girl wasn't supposed to text me
You wanna know how I know what I know


If your chick come close to me

That's how it post to be
That's how it post to be
Everything good like it post to be


Got your girl in my section finna blow up
And nigga smoking loud, I'm 'bout to roll up
She ain't never got high like this with a guy like this
When she pop it tell her hold up
Better believe she gon' leave with a real nigga
I dick her down can't put it down like I do

Team us, we ain't worried about you
Murder she wrote
Yeah, yeah, when I hit it, I'm a kill it, I'm a get it like
Murder she wrote
You wanna know how I know what I know


If your dude come close to me
He gon' wanna ride off in a ghost with me (I'll make him do it)
I might let your boy chauffeur me
But he gotta eat the booty like groceries
But he gotta get rid of these hoes for me
I might have that nigga selling his soul for me
Ooh, that's how it post to be
If he wants me to expose the freak
Ooh, that's how it post to be
Ooh, that's how it post to be
Ooh, that's how it post to be
Everything good like it post to be
