If it's not you oh no I won't do that 
You'll have to wait for me and that is that 

Shoulda known, shoulda cared 
Shoulda hung around the kitchen in my underwear 
Acting like a lady 
You shoulda made me, oh 
Shoulda jumped a little higher 
Shoulda fluttered my mascara 
Like a butterfly 
Instead of being lazy 
It woulda saved me 
 

Someone saved my heart today 
Will someone turn the light back on? 
Cos ever since you went away 
The other rushes feels so wrong 

That special something, that they are hunting 
They're always wanting, more and more 
 

Nobody sees the show 
Not 'til my heart says so 
If it's not you, oh no 
I won't do that 
Boy if you want to be my speciality 
You'll have to wait for me and that is that 

I won't (ooh), unless you want me to 
I want (you), get in the queue 
 

That special something, that they are hunting 
They're always wanting, more and more 
 

Nobody sees the show 
Until my heart says so 
If it's not you, oh no 
I won't do that 
Boy if you want to be my speciality 
You'll have to wait for me and that is that 
 

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) 
Shoulda made me now 
Gotta save me now 
 

Shoulda known, shoulda cared 
Shoulda hung around the kitchen in my underwear 
Acting like a lady 
You shoulda made me, oh 
Shoulda jumped a little higher 
Shoulda fluttered my mascara 
Like a butterfly 
Instead of being lazy 
It woulda saved me 

Shoulda known, shoulda cared 
Shoulda hung around the kitchen in my underwear 
Acting like a lady 
(Shoulda made me now) 
You shoulda made me (gotta save me now), oh 
Shoulda jumped a little higher 
Shoulda fluttered my mascara 
Like a butterfly 
Instead of being lazy 
(Shoulda made me now) 
It woulda saved me (gotta save me now) 

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
