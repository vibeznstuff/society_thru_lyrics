She's my everything,
Like a morning girl,
She's my angel, up above my world,
And she's the only one, who understands me,
That's why I call her, my new family,


See she's the only one that I want by my side,
She's the only one that I believe can save my life,
She makes me want to be a better man (Oh I)
She's higher than the sky, the suns and the moon,


She's like a star,
(Like a star, like a star)
Ooh baby she's like a star,
(Like a star, like a star)
Ooh baby she's like a star,
(Like a star, like a star)
Ooh baby she's like a star,
(Like a star, like a star)

First let me say, she's the best of me,
Is it clich√©? To say she's destiny,
There's no one else but her, well at least for me,
That's exactly why, I must now
repeat, that...






She's my star my light, starry night,
Aviator shades cos she shine so bright,
Beats on the G5, songs I write, Just so I
can take her on take them G5 flights,
Yeah she's my type, just my height,
She's my fit, she's just right,
She's like I think we might,
Go far, I'm like you right,
Cos she could be my angel wings,
Her voice sounds like an angel sings,
Yeah I be back with the trademark strings,
Just tryna compliment the sound she brings,
She's like we could go far, I'm like you, you, you are,
I'm like you, you, you are,
You are my,my, guiding star.
