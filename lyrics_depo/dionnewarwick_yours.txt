They told me love don't last forever
Now I understand
To think that only yesterday
You held me in your hands
And I became a woman
And you became the world, to me
I was lost, no dream to high
No star to far apart
Your carpet ride holding me
You led me to believe that I was yours, yours
I swallowed every lie
And you will cry when I'm away, on your own, like me
when I was yours

I could live my life without you, that is not enough
I can't lie awake believin' you don't want my love
Alone in my desire
And still the fire burns, my friend
I was there. I loved you well
Though we are far apart, I love you still
I relive the very moment when you called me yours, yours
Don't let me die inside
Save me from the memories, the hours that I cried
Say to me that I am yours, yours, mine eternity
And you will cry when I'm away
On your own, like me, when I was yours
Yours, yours, don't let me die inside
Save me from the memories, the hours that I cried
Say to me that I am yours, yours for eternity
And you will cry when I'm away
The hours that I cry
Say to me that I am yours, yours
Don't let me die inside
