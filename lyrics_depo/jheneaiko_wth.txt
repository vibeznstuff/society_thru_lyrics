I am Alice
I'm in Wonderland
Where's the rabbit?
He is late again
Goodness
Gracious
I can't wait for him
Who has got the time?
Round and round and
Round and round we go
It's just like the
Same scenario
Good for nothing
Feels like somethin' ain't right


I might
I might've got way too high

I am trippin'
I keep slippin'
I cannot recognize
What's the difference
In pretending and
Living a real lie?
Ha ha ha ha ha
Everything is spinnin now
Ha ha ha ha ha
Have you seen the ground




Break it down, roll it up
Mountains and valleys
Seashells from Sally
Ego removed but still in tune exactly
Pride to the side
Third eye winking at me
My what a ride
Real trippy shit
I glimpse with a squint
But I can see a whole grip
My retinas red
My vision is crystal
Didn't use pencil
But it's true I led
My way to this sedated state of mind I al-ways dread
My daddy did it
This is the state of mind I always had
I'm mad he died before we got to have a
Man to man
I got two packs of sweet aromatics and 14
Grams
So I take a deep breath
Puff, puff, pass
Part of my paranoia
I'm just a product of my past
I show you how to let your soul sail
Sparking lala
Talking to Allah
Might of got way too high
