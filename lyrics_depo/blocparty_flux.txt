If your right hand is causing you pain 
Cut it off cut it off
If your colours have started to run 
Let them all run, run away from you 
There is lightning in this room 
Above our heads waiting to strike
I'm a thinker not a talker 
Put your faith, your faith in God 

We were hoping for some romance 
All we found was more dispair 
We must talk about our problems 
We are in a state of Flux

I'd kill for an adventure 
Just you and I in the Curzon Bar
Dancing till we knew 
So all that we've learnt disappeared
When you shouted at me 
I saw my father in the second grade
Concerned and kind 
But yet unable to reach me 

We were hoping for some romance 
All we found was more dispair 
We must talk about our problems 
We are in a State of Flux

State of Flux 

We need to talk 

We were hoping for some romance 
All we found was more dispair 
We must talk about our problems 
We are in a state of Flux
