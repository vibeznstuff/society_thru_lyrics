We feel so good as we flock together
So much in common
We all gather gather gather
Don't need no manifesto, just a little instinct
Safety in numbers
Go for the midway

Birds of a feather...flock together oh
Birds of a feather...flock together oh

We watch the boys and girls tow the line
We watch the crowd shout out for more
Sing sing sing sing your heart out
Then times your head
Here comes the new way
Birds of a feather

Birds of a feather...flock together oh
Birds of a feather...flock together oh

We got a flock flock

We feel so good as we flock together
So much in common
We all gather gather gather
Go out and get the best
Go for the weak one
Birds of a feather...forever...yeah

Birds of a feather...flock together oh
Birds of a feather...flock together oh
Birds of a feather...flock together oh
Birds of a feather...flock together oh

Flock flock...flock together
