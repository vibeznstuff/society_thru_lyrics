This is the land where I live
Paint it all over golden
Take a little sunshine spread it all around
This is the love that I give
These are the arms for the holding
Turn on your love light shine it all around

Shine it all around, shine it all around
These are the times of my life
Bright and strong and golden
This is the way that I choose when the deal goes down
This is the world that I love

Painted all over troubled
Take a little sunshine shine it all around
End a little sign now, spread it all around now
Hine it all around now, when the deal goes down now
Shine it all around, Shine it all around

This is the heart of the man
This is the heart of the matter
Break a little bread now spread it all around
E a little bread now, all around
Shine it all around, shine it all around
