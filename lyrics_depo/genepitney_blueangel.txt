When we were kids I was your friend watching you grow
You didn't get much of the love most of us know

Oh, oh, blue angel, I can't put you down
I should know better, I grew up in your part of town
And I can bless my good fortune, I came through it fine
Oh, oh, blue angel, you will always be a good old friend of mine

How many years since you took off with your guitar
Joining a band and singing sad songs 'round the bar

Oh, oh, blue angel, guess I should have known
That's not a good life for a girl far away from home
When you were sad, poor and lonely, too proud to let on
Oh, oh, blue angel, all your better times just never came along

Now the gentlemen of Soho buy your kindness and your smile
And your flesh is just a souvenir of London for a while
But I know what keeps you going, what you spend your money on
Some pusher man from hell has got you hooked on all that's wrong

And a pretty dress don't cover up your eyes
And I won't forget the emptiness I found in your disguise

La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la

Oh, oh, blue angel, I can't put you down
I should know better, I grew up in your part of town
And I can bless my good fortune
