Did you ever wonder where the story ends, and how it all began, 
I do (I do, I do, I do, I do)
Did you ever dream you were the movie star with popcorn in your hand, 
I did (I did, I did, I did)
Do you ever think you're someone else inside, 
when no one understands you are (you are) 
And wanna disappear inside a dream but never wanna wake, wake uuuuuup 
Then you stumble on tomorrow, and trip over today


Would you be happier if you were someone together 
Would the sun shine brighter if you played a bigger part 
Would you be wonderful if it wasn't for the weather 
You're gonna be just fine (gonna be just fine)

Are you not afraid to tell your story now, 
when everyone is done it's too late (too late, too late) 
Was everything you've ever said or done not the way you planned, 
mistaaaake
So you promised that tomorrow, be different than today


Would you be happier if you were someone together 
Would the sun shine brighter if you played a bigger part
Would you be wonderful if it wasn't for the weather
You're gonna be just fine
I think you're gonna be just fine
You're gonna be just fine
So don't worry baby

You're racing for tomorrow, not finished with today

Would you be happier if you were someone together
Would the sun shine brighter if you played a bigger part 
Would you be wonderful if it wasn't for the weather 
I think you're gonna be just fine

Would we be happier if we were someone together
Would the sun shine brighter if we played a bigger part
Would we be wonderful if it wasn't for the weather 
I think we're gonna be just fine 
I think you're gonna be just fine

Don't worry baby 
Gonna be just fine 
Don't worry honey 
Gonna be just fine 
Don't worry baby 
Gonna be just fiiiiine
