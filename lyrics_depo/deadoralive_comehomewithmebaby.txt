Same place, after midnight
Saw you looking so nice
Hot stuff, pants on fire
Please me, I want you now

I'm born to flirt
You're born to run
Let's get together
And get it on

Come home with me, baby
Ooh, you must be lucky
Let's rock
You got the body I want

Come home with me, baby
Ooh, you must be lucky
I was looking for somebody that's what
You got the body I want

You got the body
You got the body I want
You got the body I want, uhh

I'm not complicated
Please, don't keep me waiting
Hold me then undress me
Smooth talk don't impress me

Ask me once and I'll say yes
I want the pleasure of your flesh
I see the look inside your eyes
Like what you see, come try me

Come home with me, baby
Ooh, you must be lucky
Let's rock
You got the body I want

Come home with me, baby
Ooh, you must be lucky
I was looking for somebody that's what
You got the body I want

Come home with me, baby
Ooh, you must be lucky
Let's rock
You got the body I want

Come home with me, baby
Ooh, you must be lucky
I was looking for somebody
You got the body
You got the body I want

Touch me, baby, touch me
My love will take you to the top
Among the stars, let's rock

Come home with me, baby
Ooh, you must be lucky
Let's rock
You got the body I want

Come home with me, baby
Ooh, you must be lucky
I was looking for somebody that's what
You got the body I want

Come home with me, baby
Ooh, you must be lucky
Let's rock
You got the body I want

Come home with me, baby
Ooh, you must be lucky
I was looking for somebody that's what
You got the body I want

You got the body
You got the body I want
You got the body I want

You know tonight
That I don't need affection
All that I want is a little piece of action
Come with me, let's rock
