Sleep peacefully now my child
I hope that you go away
To a place where your dreams can play
Wipe all the tears from your eyes
There is a sky of blue
This is your time of truth

Like a bird high on the wind
May you fly away
Like a snowfall in the spring
may you cares melt away
CHILD, innocent child
our hope lies inside
your starry eyes
my innocent child

Hero, now that you are free
You have no need to fear
so go out and find your smile
Like a candle in the stream 
May you float away
Like a feather on the breeze
May you blow away


Like a candle,
Like a snowfall
Like a feather
like a bird:fly away
Like a candle,
like a snowfall
like a feather
like a bird..fly away



Sleep peacefully now my child
I hope that you go away
to a place where you dreams can play
