If there's one great thing to happen in my life
If there's one great day, if there's one great height
Let it be the time for peace; let it be the time of right
If there's one great thing to happen in my life

I've seen to much of what fighting has done
I've seen too much anger; I've seen it far too young
And talk will come to nothing while the shouting still goes on
But we are only singers and too many songs are sung

If there's one great thing to happen in my life
If there's one great day, if there's one great height
Let it be the time for peace; let it be the time of right
If there's one great thing to happen in my life

I've seen the way of martyrs; I've seen the way of kings
I've seen the hope that love can bring
I only hope what pleases me will also pleasure you 
For mine can never be the hands that make a dream come true

If there's one great thing to happen in my life
If there's one great day, if there's one great height
Let it be the time for peace; let it be the time of right
If there's one great thing to happen in my life
