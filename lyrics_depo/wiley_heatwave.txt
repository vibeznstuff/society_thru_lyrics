If I draw 5 for the day
Then we ain't got to worry, we're nice for the day
Inspired by the sun, take flight for the day
Sippin' a cold beer, sunshine in your face

Long nights are crazy we are on them
My name's Wiley yeah play my song then
When I arrive I'm causing a heatwave
I got vibes to sell, people want them

I'ma party, I'm gon' dance, put your hands up on my body
On my body, on my body, put your hands up on my body
I'ma party, I'm gon' dance put your hands up on my body
On my body, on my body, put your hands up on my body
I'ma party, I'm gon' dance put your hands up on my body
On my body, on my body, put your hands up on my body
I'ma party, I'm gon' dance put your hands up on my body
On my body, on my body, put your hands up on my body

When the sun's out see the gyaldem too
I wake up do another gyaldem tune
I ride out on my Yamaha R6
When I reach in the dance, bring the gyaldem through

Gyaldem know so they wanna wind up
I get behind her and she get wile up
She back it up good but I try my luck
Wining up gyal is the vibe I love

When I arrive I'm causing a heatwave
I've got vibes to sell people want them
My name's Wiley yeah play my song then
When I arrive I'm causing a heatwave
Causing a heatwave, causing a heatwave, causing a heatwave
When I arrive I'm causing a heatwave

I'ma party, I'm gon' dance, put your hands up on my body
On my body, on my body, put your hands up on my body
I'ma party, I'm gon' dance put your hands up on my body
On my body, on my body, put your hands up on my body
I'ma party, I'm gon' dance put your hands up on my body
On my body, on my body, put your hands up on my body
I'ma party, I'm gon' dance put your hands up on my body
On my body, on my body, put your hands up on my body

When the sun's out we just wanna impress
I stand in the clear I don't bother with mess
If it ain't gonna sell I don't wanna invest
If it ain't got a vibe I ain't got a interest

I wanna see a ice-cream van on the road
I wanna see a light skin gyal on the road
I wanna get a slush puppy with both flavours
Drink that now I'm right back in my zone

When I arrive I'm causing a heatwave
I got vibes to sell people want them
My name's Wiley yeah play my song then
When I arrive I'm causing a heatwave
Causing a heatwave, causing a heatwave, causing a heatwave
When I arrive I'm causing a heatwave

I'ma party, I'm gon' dance, put your hands up on my body
On my body, on my body, put your hands up on my body
I'ma party, I'm gon' dance put your hands up on my body
On my body, on my body, put your hands up on my body
I'ma party, I'm gon' dance put your hands up on my body
On my body, on my body, put your hands up on my body
I'ma party, I'm gon' dance put your hands up on my body
On my body, on my body, put your hands up on m-m-y

When the sun's out see the gyaldem too
I wake up do another gyaldem tune
I ride out on my Yamaha R6
When I reach in the dance, bring the gyaldem through

Gyaldem know so they wanna wind up
