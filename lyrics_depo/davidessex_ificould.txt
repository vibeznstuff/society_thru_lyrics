If I could, love you forever
If I could love you everyday
If I could take your hand
Would ya understand
And let, me, show, the, way

If we could dance this dance forever
If we could laugh without the world
If I give you my life
Will you be my wife
Or is that too absurd

But oh we could have a lark, a lark
Picnicking in the park, the park
On Saturday night if you feel alright
We'll go to the pictures when its dark

If I were a, plumber, would you love me
If you were a waitress, I'd love you
Could you picture us
On a number nine bus
To Canning Town we two,
Just me and you

But oh we could have a lark, a lark
Picnicking, in the park, the park
On Saturday night if you feel alright
We'll go to the pictures when its dark

Yes we could, walk our walks together
Or we could raise a family
When I come home from work
I'll change me shirt
And sit by the fireside for tea,
Just you and me
