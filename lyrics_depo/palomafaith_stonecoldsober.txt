I'll be the late night lady you won't recognize
I'm a chameleon I'm always in disguise

I'll read your future but it's written in the past
Take a good look - might be your last

Don't try to show me
Cause you don't know me
Stay away!

I can be wilder than the wind
190 miles an hour
I'm in a whole other dimension
Dancing doubles on the floor

You think I'm crazy, a little bit hazy
But I'm stone cold sober

You're telling me something
But there's nothing cheap as words

I'm walking away before I do I'll flip the bird
Excuse me, Mister, I've got other things to do
Than to stand here listening to you

Stop talking at my face
Take a rocket out to space and...
Stay away!

I can be wilder than the wind
119 miles an hour
I'm in a whole other dimension
Dancing doubles on the floor

You think I'm crazy, a little bit hazy
But I'm stone cold...

I can be wilder than the wind
190 miles an hour
I'm in a whole other dimension
Dancing doubles on the floor

You think I'm crazy, a little bit hazy
But I'm stone cold sober

In the madness of the storm
I'm the one to carry on
I don't need no medicine

And If you're looking for a cure
Don't be knocking at my door
I'll never let you in

Take a rocket out to space
And stay out of my place

I can be wilder than the wind
190 miles an hour
I'm in a whole other dimension
Dancing doubles on the floor

You think I'm crazy, a little bit hazy
But I'm stone cold...

I can be wilder than the wind
190 miles an hour
I'm in a whole other dimension
Dancing doubles on the floor

You think I'm crazy, a little bit hazy
But I'm stone cold sober
