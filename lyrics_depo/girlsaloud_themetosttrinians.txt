Make us worthy make us proud
Teach us not to be too loud
We'll try and fit in with the crowd
But we are St Trinian's

We can't fake the way we feel
We were born to keep it real
Hockey sticks and balls of steel
We are St Trinian's

You bite us, we'll bite you back
Better be scared when we attack
Feel the fear, we're maniacs
St Trinian's

Check out our battle cry
A song to terrify
No one can stand in our way

We are the best, so screw the rest
We do as we damn well please
Until the end
St Trinian's
Defenders of anarchy

So scan all the toffs, the neats and the freaks
Blackmail the goths
The slappers and the geeks
And if they complain, we'll do it all again
We do as we damn well please

The ASBOs, the chavs
The emos and their mates
To torment the slags, we offer special rates
And if they complain, we'll do it all again
Defenders of anarchy

We are the best so screw the rest
We do as we damn well please
Until the end
St Trinian's
Defenders of anarchy
ST TRINIAN'S!

Victorious, rebellious
We do as we damn well please
Until the end
St Trinian's
Defenders of anarchy
ST TRINIAN'S!

Don't let the bastards get you down.
