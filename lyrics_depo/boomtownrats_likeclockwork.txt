I'm not disconnected
I'm not unaware
I'm in one place at one time
I'm neither here nor there
I'm hooked to the mainstream,
Tuned into the world
Plugged into my surroundings,
I'm not out on a limb.
I'm thinking in a straight line,
I'm thinking that these thoughts are mine,
My heart is beating oh so fast
I feel the hours crashing
Because my mind keeps time like clockwork,
And I think in sync like clockwork.

She's done away with emotion,
She sees things clearly now.
She says she sees it all from her room
And it looks so small from her room
It's all right, it's all right,
I'm on your side...for a while,
She thinks time is a concept by which we measure our pain
(She'll say it again)
She wants to say it again, but she don't have time,
And now her heart beats time like clockwork
And she thinks in sync like clockwork

Count the hours, count the months and minutes,
You're born in tears and die in pain and that's your limit
You're lookin' for a reason but there's none
There, why don't you admit it
We'll make the most of what we've got, that's the tickit
My, my, my.

I stayed in that room a long, long time
And watched the seasons gliding past
And hey...what's the matter?,
We've got time, lots of time
It's alright, it's alright,
I'm on your side for a while,
We'll wind up
We'll slow down
We'll speed up or slow down and we'll maybe overwind...
but now or minds,
