Yeah, oh
Ah, ah, ah
You know what it is
When your head go back and forth
So So Def, haha
Chante, 2k (Oooh)
Baby, come on, come on, come on

Straight up I can love you forever yo
'Cause you're the kind of guy I can settle for
I'm not the type to love you and let you go
Let me know it's now or it's never, yo

'Cause I know them other girls try and do you in
But I'm not the average girl you've been fooling with
'Cause those other females are counterfeit
But everything all up here's legit

It's like this, like this, like that, baby
Put the other girls way to the back, baby
So you know I'm not just talking that stuff, baby
Call me up and let me know what's up, baby (What's up?)

Here's the number to my cell, now hit me on the hip
Here's the number to my crib where I really live (Straight up)
I'm not thinking 'bout them other chicks (Straight up)
They ain't even coming close to this

Here's the number to my job or call me in the whip
Now how many chicks you know come with this? (Straight up)
'Cause I'm tryin'-a put you on to this (Straight up)
And I'm not just talking it

So tell me are you spoken for?
'Cause I don't see a ring on your finger, boy
Excuse me if I'm bold with my question now
But I'm not looking for a hit and run

Don't tell me how those other girls used to be
Just think about you getting used to me
I'm-a show you everything you tryin'-a see
I'm-a put you right where you need to be

It's like this, like this, like that, baby
Put the other girls way to the back, baby
So you know I'm not just talking that stuff, baby
Call me up and let me know what's up, baby (What's up?)

Here's the number to my cell, now hit me on the hip
Here's the number to my crib where I really live (Straight up)
I'm not thinking 'bout them other chicks (Straight up)

Now how many chicks you know come with this? (Straight up)
'Cause I'm tryin'-a put you on to this (Straight up)
And I'm not just talking it

A lot of girls won't do the things I do (Do)
A lot of girls won't say the things I say (Say)
Know that all of this is true (True)
Talking 'bout me loving you (Please believe)

Boy I do, coming straight up asking me
When you know what I'm about
With a game sweeter than can be
So, baby, won't you check me out?

Oooh, oooh, oooh...

Y'all know what it is when you're head go back and forth
Y'all know what it is when you're head go back and forth
(Straight up, straight up, what's up?)

Here's the number to my cell, now hit me on the hip
