Today this could be the greatest day of our lives 
Before it all ends,
Before we run out of time 

Stay close to me,
Stay close to me 
Watch the world come alive tonight 
Stay close to me. 

Tonight this could be the greatest night of our lives 
Let's make a new start,
The future is ours to find 

Can you see it,
Can you see it in my eyes 
Can you feel it now,
Can you hold it in your arms tonight 

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on (tonight) 
Hold on
Hold on 

Oh, stay close to me (hold on) 
Stay close to me 
Watch the world come alive tonight 
Stay close to me

Oh, hold your head high (hold on) 
Arms open wide 
Yeah, the world starts to come alive
When you stay close to me

Today this could be the greatest day of our lives 
Today this could be the greatest day of our lives 

Oh, and the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
And the world comes alive, oh, oh, oh

Stay close to me (and the world comes alive), hold on 
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive) 
Watch the world come alive tonight

Stay close to me (hold on) 
Oh, stay close to me
And the world comes alive
Stay close to me
And the world comes alive 

Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me, oh, oh, oh
