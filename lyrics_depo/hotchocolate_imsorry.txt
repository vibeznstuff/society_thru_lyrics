Tonight let's forgive and forget
Darling
Come closer let me hold yo
In my eyes can't you see how I love you
I never wanted to hurt you.
Say the things that I said
Don't look at me now
Like it's all over
Girl.

I'm sorry
Sorry

Come closer to me now

Let's love the tears away

Things that I say.	
Shouldn't hurt you
That way.	
I'm sorry
Sorry

Darling
Let me hold you

Never let you go.	
Girl
You should know	
That words can't come
Between you and me.	
Tonight lets start it all over
Let's talk it over
And put it right. I know how much I've hurt you

But
Baby
You're foolish to think it's over

Nothing can stop me saying forever.	
I'm sorry
Sorry
Come closer to me now
. . .	
I'm sorry
Sorry
Come closer to me now
. . .	
Sorry
Baby
I'm sorry
Sorry.
