See that white boy over there, running scared,
His old man's in a bottle.
Said he gonna quit his 9 to 5,
Now he's drinking full time in a bottle.

See that black boy over there, running scared
His old man got a problem, (and it's a bad one)
Pawned off damn near everything,
His old woman's wedding ring for a bottle.

And don't you think it's a crime
When time, after time, after time, living in the bottle.

See that sister, sure looked fine
'til she started sipping wine from the bottle.
She told me her old man committed a crime
And now he's doing time,
So now she's living in the bottle.

She's out there on the avenue, all by herself
Sure needs help from the bottle.
Preacherman tried to help her out,
She cussed him out and hit him in the head with a bottle.

And don't you think it's a crime
When time, after time, after time, living in the bottle.

See that gent in the wrinkled suit
He done damn near blown his cool to the bottle
He was a doctor helping young girls along
If they wasn't too far gone to have problems.

But defenders of the dollar bill
Said "What you doing, Doc? it ain't legal,"
And now he's in the bottle.
Now we watch him everyday trying to
Chase all the pigeons away from the bottle.

And don't you think it's a crime
When time, after time, after time, living in the bottle.
