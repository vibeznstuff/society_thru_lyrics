We were leavin' LA airport, me and Midlands Misery (Jimmy Lea) 
On an early mornin' plane flight out to some Radio XYZ
Was a 1950's prop job, that had seen much better days
When we came on in to the last approach saw the runway through the haze 

And the wheels ain't comin' down
All of my nine lives passed before my eyes
And the wheels ain't comin' down
And you realise you wanna stay alive
you wanna stay alive

Women weepin', children playin', as we roared into a climb
Men was playin', we was drinkin' lots and it never cost a dime
Alter course for San Francisco, standin' by on red alert
Gonna chance a landin' on the sea hoping nobody gets hurt 

And the wheels ain't comin' down
All of my nine lives passed before my eyes
And the wheels ain't comin' down
And you realise you wanna stay alive
you wanna stay alive
Wanna stay alive 
Stay alive 

We applauded Chuck the Captain when our feet had touched the ground
And I won't forget the moment he said 'It's OK folks, the wheels are comin' down.' 

And the wheels they're comin' down 
and you realise it's good to be alive
And the wheels they're comin' down
and you realise you're gonna still survive
It's good to be alive
It's good to be alive 
They're comin' down
They're comin' on down
They're comin' on down
They're comin' on down
