There are words to say but I swear I just can't find them
Though in my heart I know fools
May hesitate from the memories behind them
While the angels laugh and say, I told you so
Oh, I'm restless, darling I'm restless
Waiting for you to look my way
I don't think that I can wait another day

I cry when the feeling overtakes me
'Cos the love I give seems so little in your eyes
The test of time always breaks me
With nothing tried, and nothing realised
Oh, I'm restless, darling I'm restless
Waiting for you to look my way
I don't think that I can wait another day

No man is an island but you do that very well
It sure takes a fool to find another

But I believe for every heart that's broken
There's a stranger's smile to put it on the mend, then
Those old familiar feelings seldom spoken
Out of nowhere come back again
And I'm restless, darling I'm restless
Waiting for you to look my way
I don't think that I..., the hour is getting late
I can't wait another day
