Build it as it was, and tell em they will come
And nothing ever changed in a minute
They don't even notice when you don't come home

Now tell it like it is, for all it ever was
Was just another liquour-filled embrace for a minute, girl
I don't even know if you will find me at all

Oh oh, oh
Oh oh, oh

And I'll be right here singing my black and blue
I'll be right here singing my black and blue
And I'll be right here, jumping at your call
Never giving up, never give up
And I'll be right here singing my black and blue

Now blame it on the sun, you never are the one
I just play along for the minute
But maybe I should think about walking you home

And everyone's involved, yeah, we are all just wild
But you never see me out here with another girl
Giving it a reason she needs me in her home

Oh oh, oh
Oh oh, oh

And I'll be right here singing my black and blue
I'll be right here singing my black and blue
And I'll be right here, jumping at your call
Never giving up, never give up
And I'll be right here singing my black and blue

Oh oh, oh
Oh oh, oh

And I'll be right here singing my black and blue
I'll be right here singing my black and blue
And I'll be right here, jumping at your call
Never giving up, never give up
And I'll be right here singing my black and blue
