Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
We are taking it easy
Bright and breezy, yeah
We are living it up
Just fine and dandy, yeah

And it really doesn't matter that we don't eat
And it really doesn't matter if we never sleep
No it really doesn't matter, really doesn't matter at all

Coz we are so young now, we are so young, so young now
And when tommorow comes, we can do it all again

We are chasin' the moon
Just running wild and free
We are following through
Every dream and every need

And it really doesn't matter that we don't eat
And it really doesn't matter if we never sleep
No it really doesn't matter, really doesn't matter at all

Coz we are so young now, we are so young, so young now
And when tommorow comes, we can do it all again
Yeah, we are so young now, we are so young, so young now
And when tommorow comes, we'll just do it all again
All again, all again, yeah, all again, all again..., Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
So young now, we are so young, so young now
And when tommorow comes, we'll just do it all again
Yeah, we are so young now, we are so young, so young now
And when tommorow comes, we'll just do it all again
We are so young... (Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah-ie Yeah)
We are so young... (Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah-ie Yeah)
