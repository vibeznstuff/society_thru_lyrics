So you think electronic music is boring?
You think, It's stupid?
You think it's repetitive?
Well, It is rep-repetitive
I don't know, skip a beat
I don't know, skip a beat
I don't know, skip a beat
I don't know, skip a beat
We use special tricks
With a computer

I don't know, skip a beat
Find myself on stage but I hate to speak
I said I don't know, skip a beat
It's my right to dance without two left feet
I said I don't know, skip a beat
Wanna be a social but I hate to greet
I said I don't know, skip a beat
Scared of heights but I gotta leap
I said I don't know, skip a beat
Cause I'm leaping for the stars
No clothes, I'm far from far,
If I won't try, I won't go
I'll never leave, I won't go
Can't believe it, I won't grow
No, not fast

Move your left, move your right
I kept a light hand and I kept trying to fight
I said mmm move your left, move your right
Come a little closer if you like the limelight
I said mmm move your left, move your right
I want to surround and keep your here in my sight
I said move your left, move your right
Getting confused 'cause everyone's taking all their time
They chase and flex the beat, it's on my mind
Never liked classical, or even grime
Now they one-handed, won't land it
Won't stand it - Clean Bandit

Little touch up, pizzicato
Relax the tempo, sip some rubato
And if I get too animato
Tan my face with adagietto
A niente, mezzoforte
Allegro or andante
I can make this voice staccato and it makes it all legato
I don't know, skip a beat
We're rushing now, we'll feel the heat
The doors are open, but the music's in time
Is this the place, the final round
Cruising at the speed of Ayrton Senna
Watching the beat, we'll get to Vienna
Without a doubt, the strings are fine the bass is out
Give us an entrance, you wrote this house

Couple of skip beats, a couple of movements ow,
Now we made it to Mozart's House
Couple of skip beats, a couple of movements ow
Couple of skip beats, a couple of movements ow
Couple of skip beats, a couple of movements ow
This is Mozart's House
