Everytime I think of you, I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here, and you're miles away
and I'm wondering why you left
And there's a storm that's raging 
through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time thinking about you
and it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking
down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all (missing you)
since you've been gone away (missing you),
I ain't missing you (missing you)
No matter what I might say (missing you)

There's a message in the wire 
and I'm sending the signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
and it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world I have no meaning
though I'm trying hard to understand
and it's my heart that's breaking
down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all (missing you)
since you've been gone away (missing you),
I ain't missing you (missing you)
No matter what my friends say (missing you)

there's a message that I'm sending out
via telegraph to your soul
and if I can't breach this distance
stop this heartbreak overload

I ain't missing you at all ...ow...(missing you)
since you've been gone away (missing you),
I ain't missing you (missing you)
No matter what my friends say (missing you)
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you.. I can't lie to myself
And there's a storm that's raging 
through my frozen heart tonight
I ain't missing you at all
I ain't missing you...missing you
I ain't missing you, oh no
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you..
Everytime I think of you, I always catch my breath.
