See your reflection in the mire
You keep your revelations wide
They knew just where to draw the line
You let them cut you every time

Though it breaks your heart
You had to sell the farm
Back to California where it's warm

It fell around you like the stars
You picked up everything they dropped
And though it breaks you like a song (?)
You had some secrets of your own

And though it breaks your heart
You had to sell the farm
Back to California where it's warm
It's warm
It's warm

And though it breaks your heart
You had to sell the farm
Nights were just too long
With all your children gone
Would it keep you strong
If I said it with a song?
Back to California where it's warm
