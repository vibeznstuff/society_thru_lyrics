You've got a hold on me
Hey don't you know
We've gone to far for me to let you go

You sold my love away
And then you tried
To see it burning in a stranger's eyes

I remember the good times
I remember the things we used to do

Now I know what made Otis blue
Girl, it must be love
What we're going through

Now I know what made Otis blue
Every single night
I keep holding you

Don't make me sleep alone
Don't make me bleed
How can you waste your love in jealousy

If we're together baby
Your eyes will see
There is no other lover here with me

Do you remember the good times?
Do you remember when every word was true?

Now I know what made Otis blue
Girl, it must be love
What we're going through

Now I know what made Otis blue
Every single night
I keep holding you

There's no one else, only you
And I'm begging you
Don't turn my heart to hurt this
Oh no

Now I know what made Otis blue

Now I know what made Otis blue
Girl, it must be love
What we're going through

Now I know what made Otis blue
Every single night
I keep holding you
