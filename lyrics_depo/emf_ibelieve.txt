I believe
I believe sometimes I touch
I believe, love
I deserve
I deserve, much more than this
I deserve, love

This is hopeless now
As the minute stall
Sometimes I don't mind at all
Particularly the times with you

O.K. that's fine as long as you believe
The only things moving don't mean a thing
Can you believe it, it's getting blue
Straight through, line for line, trash

Don't touch this
