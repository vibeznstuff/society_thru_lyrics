They say that time
Heals everything
But they don't know you
And the scars you bring

'Cos you left a jagged hole
And I can't stand it anymore

If heartache was a physical pain
I could face it I could face it
But you're hurting me 
From inside of my head
I can't take it I can't take it

I'm gonna lose my mind
I'm gonna lose my mind

I'd erase my thoughts
If only I knew how
Fill my head with white noise
If it would drown you out
Kill the sound

If heartache was a physical pain
I could face it I could face it
But you're hurting me 
From inside of my head
I can't take it I can't take it

I'm gonna lose my mind
I'm gonna lose my mind

And I'd rather be crazy
I'd rather go insane
Than having you stalk 
My every thought
Then having you here inside my heart

If heartache was a physical pain
I could face it I could face it
But you're hurting me 
From inside of my head
I can't take it I can't take it

I'm gonna lose my mind
I'm gonna lose my mind
