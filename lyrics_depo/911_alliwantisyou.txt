Ooh baby, oh oh
All I want is you

Baby, I've tried but I can't help myself
Can't disguise the way I feel inside
I'm falling so helplessly it's true, yeah
I close my eyes and believe completely
That I can feel you touching my skin so tenderly
Come morning light just the victim of fantasy

Every time I close my eyes
You just disappear you say goodbye
Baby, I'd do anything to make you mine
Oh, it's true


All I want is you
(I'll give my heart and soul)
All I want is you
(I'll be there when you call)
All I wanna do
(is make love to you)
All I want is you, all I want is you

I can't sleep 'til the last star leaves the sky
With every beat of my heart
I wanna make you mine
I'm praying you feel the same way too
Tell me that you hear my call tonight

Oh you can bring this dream to life
Baby, I'd do anything to make you mine
Oh, it's true


All I want is you
(I'll give my heart and soul)
All I want is you
(I'll be there when you call)
All I wanna do
(is make love to you)
All I want is you, all I want is you

All you gotta do is believe in me you'll find sanctuary
Just one chance is all I need to prove that you and I
Are for ever meart to be

(All I want is you)
(All I want is you)
(All I want is you)
(All I want is you)
All I want is you
All I wanna do is
(make love to you)
All I want is you, all I want is you

Baby, I'll give my heart and soul
(I'll give my heart and soul)
Give my heart and soul
(I'll be there when you call)
All I wanna do
(is making love to you)
Oh you know it's true
All I want is you, all I want is you

All I want is you
(I'll give my heart and soul)
All I want is you
(I'll be there when you call)
All I wanna do
(is make love to you)
All I want is you, all I want is you
