I've been waiting
All my life
For someone like you
To come mess with my mind

Someone crazy
Someone who
Someone who'll love me
The way I loved you

I keep searching
And what's worse
Now that you're gone,
All that's left is the hurt

Three little words
That's all that I've got
Three little words, 
Like it or not

Tell me you noticed?
Tell me you heard?
For you I'd have run to
the ends of the Earth
I couldn't keep you,
but I'll keep my word
It's the most beautiful
pain in the world
I love how it hurts

I've been trying
Since you left
Trying to fix all the 
bits that you wrecked

I'm just waiting
Till it mends
Then I'll let you break 
it again and again

Three little words
That's all that I've got
Three little words, 
Like it or not

Tell me you noticed?
Tell me you heard?
For you I'd have run to
the ends of the Earth
I couldn't keep you,
but I'll keep my word
It's the most beautiful
pain in the world
I love how it hurts

I've been losing my mind
I pretend that it's fine
Trying to keep it together
While I crumble inside
You got a friend at
the end of the line

Give me a moment
Give me a chance
Lost in the hurt
Caught in the past

Give me a moment
Give me the past
Give me the hurt
I know we can last

Tell me you noticed?
Tell me you heard?
For you I'd have run to
the ends of the Earth
I couldn't keep you,
but I'll keep my word
It's the most beautiful
pain in the world
And I love how it hurts

This is my journey
This ain't the end
I'm waiting here
Till I see you again
