Years ago, when I was younger
I kinda liked, a girl I knew
She was mine, and we were sweethearts
That was then, but then it’s true

I’m in love, with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
Coz I don’t care if I lose my mind
I’m already cursed

Everyday, we started fighting
Every night, we fell in love
No one else, could make me sadder
But no one else, could lift me high above

I don’t know, what I was doing
When suddenly, we fell apart
Nowadays, I cannot find her
But when I do, we’ll get a brand new start

I’m in love, with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
Coz I don’t care if I lose my mind
I’m already cursed

She’s a fairytale, yeah
Even though it hurts
Coz I don’t care if I lose my mind
I’m already cursed
