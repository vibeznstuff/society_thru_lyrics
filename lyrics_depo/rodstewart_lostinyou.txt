Hey baby
You've Been On My Mind Tonight
I'm So lonely
I just had to sit down and write
I spent all yesterday
Trying to figure out what I'm gonna say
A letter from the heart
is so hard to start baby
How's your mama, how's the wheather
How's that son of mine, yeah.

Hey baby
Been a long time since we made love
I'm stone cold, the bed's hard
and the work is tough
I'm never gonna leave you again
This job ain't worth the pain
No money in the world
ain't worth being away from you
Ooh baby I don't sleep
without you by my side, listen

I'm in love with you woman
It's a common known natural fact
And I've found what I'm looking for
And it's so much more than that
I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you
I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you

Hey baby
you don't know what you've done for me
I'm so happy
as any man can deserve to be
I was living in a life of sin
God knows what a mess I was in
So glad you found me
I ain't getting any younger
Hey baby I just hope
it ain't all a dream

I'm in love with you woman
It's a common known natural fact
And I've found what I'm looking for
And it's so much more than that
I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you
I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you

I miss you baby
I miss you too

I miss your laughing eyes
I miss our baby crying
I wanna lay you out
and kiss you all over
I'm coming home real soon
Be ready cause when I do
I'm gonna make love to you
Like fifteen men.

I'm lost in you and I love it
I'm lost in you and I love it
I'm lost in, I'm lost in
I'm lost in you
I'm lost in, I'm lost in
I'm lost in you
And I just love it
Hey baby I love it
Child I love it
I'm lost in you, yeah
