My motivation is gone too soon
The good vibrations all over you
Act like you mean it, you mean it
You've got a story you never tell
Down in the delta you're ringing bells
I've never seen it, seen it
Back of my mind I'm on my way
I see through smiles on every face
I don't believe it, believe it

Cuz I'm the supersoaker red, white
And blew 'em all away
With a kiss as unclean
As the words that you say

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Mister walk away, walk away

Your flags are flying across the plains
I've got a secret picking in my brain
I want to see you, see you
The exit sign is on my face
Don't know my home, I don't know my place

I just want to be there, be there
Cuz I'm the supersoaker red, white
And blew 'em all away
With a kiss as unclean
As the words that you say

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Mister walk away, walk away

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Mister walk away oh

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
I just lay it on the line, on the line

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Mister walk away, walk away

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Mister walk away oh
