Fergus sings the Blues
In bars of twelve or less
I'm a stranger
To the land
To this wilderness

All things are possible
But happen less and less
This is my country
These are my reasons

'Cause I look
In the mirror
And it throws
Back the question
And I whisper in words
That beg
An answer
Tell me
Can this white man sing the blues

Homesick James
My biggest influence
Tell me why
James and Bobby Purify

I'm lost in music
Sweet soul music
This is my country
These are my reasons



From the north coast
To the uplands
Stay on the left side of the white lines
From the Campsies
Over Christmas
I still dream of Memphis



I got the blue blue world
And I see The blue blue sky
I got the blue blue ocean
In my blue eye
So tell me can this white man sing the blues
