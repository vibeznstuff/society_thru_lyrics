What a life
A trick of light
Then everything returns to the sea
You can have whatever you want
But are you disciplined enough to be free

Turning love into a chore
Promises come cheap dear reader
Another page, another door
Follow, follow me

I know what I'm here for
Hanging on through late December
I know what I'm here for
Follow, follow me

Moving on
Don't belong
My life turned into a mall
Every line is in the song
Follow me out of the fall

What an actor, what a show
Going through some holy motions
The bands are sharp but the singers slow
Everything must go

I know what I'm here for

Souvenirs, polygraph tests
Photographs fresh from the wreck
What a poster saint he'll make
In one take, one take

I know what I'm here for
Follow, follow me
