Can’t keep it to myself
Baby girl, I think I need…

I want you to feel the love I have inside me
Inside you tonight
I want you to feel the love I have inside me
Inside you tonight

I want you to feel it
I want you to feel it, yeah

Lay it down, it’s time to pay up
I’m fresh up off the re-up
I know you're used to rain, but tonight you gonna pour
They might hear you scream while I’m giving you more

I want you to feel it
I want you to feel it, yeah

I want you to feel the love I have inside me
Inside you tonight
I want you to feel the love I have inside me
Inside you tonight


Viens ici, j'attends
Je veux sentir ton amour
Embrasse-moi
Arrête de parler
N'arrête pas
N'arrête pas

I want you to feel it
I want you to feel it, yeah

I want you to feel the love I have inside me
(Too much love, can’t keep it to myself
Baby girl, I think I need your help)
Inside you tonight
(Said, too much love, can’t keep to myself
Baby girl, I think I need your waist)
I want you to feel the love I have inside me
(Said, too much love, can’t keep to myself
Baby girl, I think I need your hips)
Inside you tonight
(Said, too much love, can’t keep to myself
And all night we gon' do it “to the beat, ya’ll”)
