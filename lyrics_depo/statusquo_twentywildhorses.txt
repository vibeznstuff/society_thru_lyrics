How do you do? Tell me how are you?
Have you been well? Give my regards to the world
Hand on my heart, I didn't do what they say
'Cos I would rather be blind or lose my mind completely

Twenty wild horses and five hundred men
They couldn't drag me that far down again
Give me a Colt 45 to my head
So I can say I'd be better off dead
Straight as an arrow I'll make a new start
What can I tell you, it's straight from the heart

I have a dream and it's the same every night
I sleep with you, everything seems to be right
Beyond belief, when I awake and I find
That I am stuck in this place, my back's to the wall completely

Twenty wild horses and five hundred men
They couldn't drag me that far down again
Give me a Colt 45 to my head
So I can say I'd be better off dead
Straight as an arrow I'll make a new start
What can I tell you, it's straight from the heart

So what can I say?
Seems that in here I find everyone is innocent

All I can do is hope and pray for an end
I've had enough, but that don't change anything
Hand on my heart, I didn't do what they say
Now at the end of the line, I'm losing my mind completely

Twenty wild horses and five hundred men
They couldn't drag me that far down again
Give me a Colt 45 to my head
So I can say I'd be better off dead
Straight as an arrow I'll make a new start
What can I tell you, it's straight from the heart
Twenty wild horses and five hundred men
They couldn't drag me that far down again
