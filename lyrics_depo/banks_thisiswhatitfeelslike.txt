I hang on everything that you say
You know I can see all the things that imply
You secretly are in love
And finally when I let myself fall hard for you
I see you trying to pretend
Like I’m making it up
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like


Bring it down, bring it on
Bring it now, bring it on
This is what it feels like now
It’s getting old
Bring it down, bring it on


Remember the first love that we made
You said that you couldn’t sleep cause
Of me, told me
I caught you off guard
And then when you saw I felt the same
You pulled away
Started acting like being with me was too hard
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
