The truth be told, the truth be told 
I'm worried about the future holds, the future holds 
I'm starting to worry about Ray 

The truth be told, the truth be told 
I'm worried about the future holds, the future holds 
I'm seriously worried about Ray 

They say the future's out to get you 
You know that I won't let you fall 
They say the future's out to get you 
You know that I won't let you fall 

The truth be told, the truth be told 
I'm treading on my tippy toes, my tippy toes 
I'm starting to worry about Ray 

The truth be told, the truth be told 
I'm treading on my tippy toes, my tippy toes 
I'm painfully so worried about Ray 

They say the future's out to get you 
You know that I won't let you fall 
They say the future's out to get you 
You know that I won't let you fall 
No! 

They say the future's out to get you 
You know that I won't let you fall 
They say the future's out to get you 
You know that I won't let you fall 

The future's out to get you, the future's out to get you, oh 
The future's out to get you, the future's out to get you, oh 

The truth be told, the truth be told 
I'm worried what the future holds, the future holds 
I'm so tired of being worried about Ray
