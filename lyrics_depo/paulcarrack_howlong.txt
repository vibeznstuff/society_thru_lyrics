Well, your friends and their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme
And I can't help but have my suspicions, baby
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem

You said that you never intended
To break up our scene in this way
For there ain't any use pretending, babe
It could happen to us any day

How long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?

Well, your friends and their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme
I can't help but have my suspicions
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem

Well, you said you never intended
To break up our scene in this way
But there ain't any use in pretending
It could happen to us any day

How long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?

Yeah, yeah
Oh, ohh
Tell me baby
Whoa

Oh, and your friends with their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme
Can't help but have my suspicions, baby
Ain't quite as dumb as I seem

Oh, you said you never intended
To break up our scene in this way
Ain't any use in pretending
It could happen to us any day

How long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?

Tell me baby (How long)
How long (Going on)
Going on, going on
(How long) How long has this been going on?
Going on baby, how long?
