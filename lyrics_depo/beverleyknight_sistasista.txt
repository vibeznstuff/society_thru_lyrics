(Oh)
(oh sista)
(sista, sista)

Sitting alone with a head full of empty thoughts
Playing with time that she just doesn't have
Dreaming that life is a stranger that brings you flowers
Praying the dream is as real as she feels it is

Dreams give you anything
Knowing that chance can bring you to the other side
Wanting her future there
Feeling that love affair
With the other side

Sista, sista better run, better fly
Better weather's on the other side
Sista, sista stand up tall, don't you ever fall
Sista, sista can't you hear my call?

Over the bridge, turning right at the stop sign
Lives a woman, who thinks as you do
Watching the world thru' the glare of a TV screen
Wonderin' what's round the corner for you

I would give anything
Hoping that chance could bring you to the other side
Soon as my thoughts are clear, one day I'll see you there
On the other side

Sista, sista better run, better fly
Better weather's on the other side
Sista, sista stand up tall, don't you ever fall
Sista, sista can't you hear my call?

Calling
Oh, calling Calling
Sista, sista, sista, sista
My sista

Sista, sista better run, better fly
Better weather's on the other side
Sista, sista stand up tall, don't you ever fall
Sista, sista can't you hear my call?

Oh, sista, sista better run, better fly
Better weather on the other side (oh)
Sista, sista stand up tall, don't you ever fall
Sista, sista can't you hear my call?

Cant you hear my call

Sista, sista better run, better go and fly
Better weather's on the other side
Sista, sista stand up tall, don't you ever fall
Sista, sista can't you hear me
Hear me
Hear me
Don't you hear me call?

(Sista, sista) Won't you run, won't you hide?
Better weather's on the other side
Sista, sista stand up tall, don't you ever fall
Sista, sista can't you hear this call?
Calling to you
