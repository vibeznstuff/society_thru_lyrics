Ohh
The clock hits twelve,
She entered the room
But if looks could kill,
Then we all would be doomed

After just one kiss,
You're not able to move
From her venomous lips and her poison perfume

Yeah

You started swaying so sexy,
And looking at me and it got me
Caught in her mind control

This place is prison,
I'm chained up
I give up,
I'm out of mercy
She wouldn't let me go

She said she liked to dance all by herself
She's a party girl
Oh oh, oh oh
She don't care
'bout nobody else,
She's in her own world
Oh oh,
I love this little party girl
Ohhh
I love this little party girl
Ohhh
She's such a little party girl

I gotta leave this room,
'cause it's starting to spin
No escape from this mess
That I'm in,
She can't resist the temptation that's in
She pulls you collar up
Before she sinks her teeth in, yeah

She started swaying so sexy,
And looking at me and it got me
Caught in her mind control

This place is prison,
I'm chained up
I give up,
I'm out of mercy
She wouldn't let me go

She said she liked to dance all by herself
She's a party girl
Oh oh, oh oh
She don't care
'bout nobody else,
She's in her own world
Oh oh,
I love this little party girl
Ohhh
I love this little party girl
Ohhh
She's just a little party girl

I love this little party girl
Yeaah!

She liked to dance all by herself
She's a party girl
Oh oh, oh oh
She don't care
'bout nobody else,
She's in her own world
Oh oh,
I love this little party girl
Ohhh
I love this little party girl
Ohhh
She's just a little party girl
