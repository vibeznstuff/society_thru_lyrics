Woman
You know you're a woman
You got to be a woman
I got the feeling of love

When you're talking to me
You see right through me
I got the feeling of love

She's a woman
You know what I mean
You better listen
Listen to me
She's gonna set you free

Well you're kinda looking at me
Like I've got to set you free
You know I can't be nobody

She's a woman
You know what I mean
You better listen
Listen to me
She's gonna set you free

Woman
You know you're a woman
You got to be a woman
I got the feeling of love

When you're talkin' to me
You see right through me
I got the feeling of love

She's a woman
You know what I mean
You better listen
Listen to me
She's gonna set you free
