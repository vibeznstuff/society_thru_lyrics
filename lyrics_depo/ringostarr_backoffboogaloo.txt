Go!

Back off boogaloo,
I said, back off boogaloo,
I said, back off boogaloo, boo.

Back of boogaloo,
What d'yer think i'm gonna do?
I got a flash right from the start.

Wake up, meat head,
Don't pretend that you are dead,
Get yourself up off the cart.

Get yourself together now
And give me something tasty.
Ev'rything you try to do,
You know it sure sounds wasted.

Back off boogaloo,
I said, back off boogaloo.

You think you're a groove,
Standing there in your wallpaper shoes
And your socks that match your eyes.

Back off boogaloo,
I said, back off boogaloo,
Come on, back off boogaloo, boo.

Get yourself together now
And give me something tasty.
Ev'rything you try to do,
You know it sure sounds wasted.

Back off boogaloo,
What d'yer think i'm gonna do?
I got a flash right from the start.

Back off boogaloo,
I said, back off boogaloo,
Come on, back off boogaloo, boo.

Back off boogaloo,
I said, back off boogaloo,
Come on, back off boogaloo, boo.

Back, ba-ba-ba-back!

Back off boogaloo,
I said, back off boogaloo,
Come on, back off boogaloo, boo.

Back off boogaloo,
I said, back off boogaloo,
Come on, back off boogaloo, boo.

Back, back, ba-ba-back, come on!

Back off boogaloo,
I said, back off boogaloo,
Come on, back off boogaloo, boo.

Back off boogaloo,
I said, back off boogaloo,
Come on, back off boogaloo, boo.
