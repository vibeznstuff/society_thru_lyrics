Honey, I know that you didn't know
That Loving me could be like this
But you're not alone
My mind was blown
I could not resist

And now I find myself
Taken over by the feeling
And I know within my heart
It's too late to say goodbye now
There's a place in me
That belongs to you, baby
So relax and be mine


Now that loves taken over me
What will I do now
Now that loves taken over you
Baby, I'll show you
How it feels to live in ecstasy
Ecstasy, ecstasy
Now that loves taken over

Too Bad for you
You can't free yourself from me
Don't bother to
You'll have to stay here forever

And now you find yourself
Taken over by the feelin'
And you know within your heart
It's too late to say goodbye, now
There's a place in you that belongs
to me, baby
So relax and be mine

Honey, I can't feel sorry for ya
You've got me lovin' you so much
I just can't let go

You should've known one day
That love was gonna catch up to ya
And now you know



Flyin' high in the friendly skies
Feels so good sometimes it makes me cry

This love's got to be here for always
I can't give you up,
I won't give you up
No way
