This is my moment
This is my perfect moment with you
This is what God meant
This is my perfect moment with you

I wish I could freeze this space in time
The way I feel for you inside

This is my moment
This is my perfect moment with you

Tell me you love me when you leave
You're more than a shadow, that's what I believe
You take me to places I never dreamed I'd see
Minute by minute you are the world to me

I wish I could frame the look in your eyes
The way that i feel for you inside

This is my moment
This is my perfect moment with you

And if tomorrow brings a lonely day
Here and now i know I haven't lived in vain
I'll cry my tears in the rain
and if love never comes again
I can always say I've been
to paradise skies in your eyes... in your eyes

So tell me you love me the moment you leave
You're more than a shadow, I've just to believe

I wish I could keep you all of my life
The way that I feel for you inside
This is my moment
This is my perfect moment with you
This is my moment
This is my perfect moment
With you, with you..
