Put on my raving shoes and I boarded a plane
touched down in a land where the skies were blue
in the middle of the the pouring rain
everybody was happy
energy shining down on me
yeah, I've got a first class ticket
feel as good as a boy can be

I'm raving, I'm raving
I'm raving till the sweat has fallen down off me
I'm raving, I'm raving
but do I really feel the way I feel
yeah
