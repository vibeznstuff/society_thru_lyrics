Oooooh-
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm begging

Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out baby
Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out darling

Riding high, when I was king
Played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
Walked away, won me then
But easy come and easy go
And it would end


So why anytime I bleed you let me go,
Anytime I feed you get me know
Anytime I see you let me know
But, I planted that seed just let me go
I'm on my knees when I'm ( begging)
'Cause I don't want to lose (you)
I got my arms on spread
And I hope that my heart gets fed
Matter of fact girl I'm begging


Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out darling


I need you, (yeah) to understand
Tried so hard
To be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again


An empty shell
I used to be
Shadow of my life
Was hanging over me

A broken man
Without a none
Won't even stand the devil's dance
To win my soul

Why we chewing? Why we chasing?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?

You're on the wrong way track from the good
I want to paint in the pictures any way we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it the away, you had it and you took the pay

But I keep walking on, keep opening doors
Keep hoping for that the door is yours
Keep also home, 'cause I don't want to live in a broken home,
Girl I am begging


Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out darling


I'm fighting hard
To hold my own
No, I just can't make it
All alone

I'm holding on
I can't fall back
Now that big brass ring
Is a shade of black


Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out darling

Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out darling

Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out darling
