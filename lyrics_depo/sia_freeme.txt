I don't want to hold your gaze
I'm scared what I might see there
Found myself locked in this place
And I'm a burning fire

Peace may come
I hope it won't take long
Just a fail I cannot see
Bring me home
I'm in here all alone
Just me and my melody

So free me
Oh free me
From this pain I've been running from
I'm tired and I'm free-falling
Free me
Oh free me
From this shame I've been running from
I'm lost and I am calling you

I'm lost and I am calling
I'm lost and I am calling

I, I'm hurting way back down
I'm slipping even further
Take my hand and turn me around
I'm listening to myself

Peace may come
I hope it won't take long
Just a fail I cannot see
Bring me home
I'm in here all alone
Just me and my melody

So free me
Oh free me
From this pain I've been running from
I'm tired and I'm free-falling
Free me
Oh, free me
From this shame I've been running from
I'm lost and I am calling

I'm calling you
And though I can't undo
All the things I put you through
I can't take your hand
Admit that I don't have a plan
Only you

Free me
Free me
From this pain I've been running from
I'm tired and I'm free-falling
Free me
Free me
From this shame I've been running from
I'm lost and I am calling you

Free me
Free me
I'm lost and I am calling
Free me
Free me
From this shame I've been running from
I'm lost and I am calling you
