When I'm in trouble or out of step
If my balance has been upset
Oh, there's a feeling I can't accept
There's one thing that helps me to forget

Wonder what I'm thinking
Wonder why I'm drinking
But it's plain to see
I'm not the man I used to be

If life were easy and didn't ask
Didn't tease me or take things back
I could start to understand
What makes me the man I am

Wonder what I'm thinking
Wonder why I'm drinking
But it's plain to see
I'm not the man I used to be

Oh, it's plain and it's a shame
I'm not the man I used to be

I've lost dreams that won't come back
Memories fading fast
I should save the ones I have
What's the use, most of them are bad

Wonder what I'm thinking
Wonder why I'm drinking
But it's plain to see
I'm not the man I used to be

Oh, it's plain and it's a shame
I can't explain
But I'm not the man I used to be

It's a shame, don't know my name
I can't explain
I'm not the man I used to be

Do you know my name
Do you, do you need explain
Do you know
