Jenny was sitting in the lounge 
She was talking to herself  
Well maybe things like that turn you on 
Maybe you felt that for yourself 

Well I'm a believer ya ya ya Oh Oh Oh 

So, tell me the dreams that you might have 
Tell me the stories in your life 
There's a girl who wouldn't stop now  
And she'll never be your wife 

Well I'm a believer ya ya ya Oh Oh Oh 

Jenny's coming after you Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh 
Jenny's coming after you Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh 
You keep shining on, shining on 
But you'll never know where your place will be 
And I guess it's true that your not me Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh 

Mandy: OH OH OH OH OH OH OH 

And I guess it true that we ignore our mother 
And we change our color, change our friends 
It's a soul searching motherfucker 

Hey we never meant, hey we never say, hey they will never say 
To say the way we feel, the pain has never ever gone out 
Never should have, Never should have 
It's below the soul 

And as though I know a million people could be loved 
I'll never see you again, I'll never see you again 
Come on, come on baby 

Oh my God she'll be coming after you in the summertime HEY! HEY! HEY! 
Oh my God she'll be coming after you in the summertime HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! 

Jenny! Jenny! 
Jenny I'd bet you'd make your Mom so proud 
I need my cell!
