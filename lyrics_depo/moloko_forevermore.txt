And if I drown in this sea of devotion
Just a stone left unturned
My need is deep
Wide endless oceans
Feel it furious
The fire burns on

Let there be love
Everlasting
And it will live eternally
Will we receive without ever asking?
I'm just curious

Gotta find me somebody
But there's nobody
To love me
And it's driving me crazy
There's nobody, to love me
Ooh, baby

Somebody tell me
How could there be nobody
Nobody to love me
And this life is so empty
There's nobody, to love me

Endless tears
Forever joy
To feel most every feeling
Forever more

And if I drown in this sea of devotion
Just a stone left unturned
My need is deep
Wide endless oceans
Feel it furious
The fire burns on

Let there be love
Everlasting
And it will live eternally
Will we receive without ever asking?
I'm just curious

Don't want you to see me crying
Just want you to see me flying
I need to get so high and
Want somebody to blow my mind

Don't want you to see me crying
Just want you to see me flying
I need to get so high and
Why don't you blow my mind
Blow my mind
Blow my mind

Got to find me somebody
But there's nobody
To love me
Anybody could love me

And it's driving me crazy
There's nobody to love me
Anybody could love me

Somebody to hold my hand
Someone who understands
Somebody to help me write
The poetry of life
Someone to love me
Someone who loves me
Ooh, baby

Endless tears
Forever joy
To feel most every feeling
Forever more

Gotta find me somebody
But there's nobody
To love me

And it's driving me crazy
There's nobody to love me

To feel most every feeling...
