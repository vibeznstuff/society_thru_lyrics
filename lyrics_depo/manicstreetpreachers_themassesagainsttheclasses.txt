"The primary role of the government is to protect property from the majority and so it remains"

Ahhh...

Hello it's us again
We're still so in love with you
And yes we mean it too
Yes we're so in love with you

Hello it's us again
You thought you were our friends
Success is an ugly word 
Especially in your tiny world

The masses against the classes
We're tired of giving a reason
When the future is what we believe in
We love the winter, it brings us closer together

So can you hurt us anymore
Can you feel like it was before
Or are you lost forever more, messed up and dead on alcohol

Hello and fond farewell my dear
I hope you hear this nice and clear
Our love is unconditional
Our hate is yours to feed upon

The masses against the classes
We're tired of giving a reason
When the future is what we believe in
We love the winter, it brings us closer together

The masses against the classes
We're tired of giving a reason
When we're the only thing left to believe in
We love the winter, it brings us closer together
