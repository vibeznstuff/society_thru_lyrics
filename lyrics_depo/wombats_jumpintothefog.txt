What a great achievement it was
To get a hotel room this late
I bet they charge by the hour here
The kind of place where you should bring your own UV ray

It's not a big problem with me, love
You don't look that hygienic anyway
I'm only here because
I wanna twist the structure of my average day

We feel nothing so jump into the fog
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing so jump into the fog
I just hope it's your bones that shatter not mine
We feel nothing so jump into the fog
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing so jump into the fog

What a great achievement it was
To find someone who shirks such little self-restraint
I'm a non-believer but
I believe in these dirty little wicked games

Snakes and ladders are banned in here love
The climb's too rough just to slide back down again
I'm only here because
I feel the day deserves a truly sordid end

We feel nothing so jump into the fog
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing so jump into the fog
I just hope it's your brains that splatter not mine
We feel nothing so jump into the fog
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing so jump into the fog

I've made some bad decisions, I'll admit that freely
It's just that life tastes sweeter when it's wrapped in debauchery
So drop your map, drop your plans, drop that five-step program
Because there's not an ounce of faith in this leap
It's clear you feel nothing so jump into the fog with me

Jump into the fog!
Jump into the fog!
Jump into the fog!
Jump into the fog!
