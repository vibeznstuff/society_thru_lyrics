Everyday someone finds a love, they say
And I know it will be okay

Yeah, love will come as it does to everyone
'Though I know it won't be too easy
Yeah, love means together then they throw it away
Throw it away is what they do everyday

But when love comes, we'll have fun
It's run, run, run, run, run

Everyday someone finds a love, they say
And I know it will be okay

Yeah, love will come as it does to everyone
Though I know it won't be too easy
Yes, when love comes, love comes and goes within a day
So, when it comes to me, I'm gonna make sure it stays

Everyday
