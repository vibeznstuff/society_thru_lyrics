Oh loverboy To you I belong
But maybe one day you'll wake
and you'll find me gone
But loverboy
If you call me home

I'll come driving
I'll come driving
Fast as wheels can turn

Oh loverboy I know you too well 
and all of my lonely secrets
To you I tell 
The highest of highs 
The lowest of lows

I'll come driving 
I'll come driving
Fast as wheels can turn

Stretching away as far as my eyes can see
Deserts and darkness, my hand on the wheel
Loverboy, please call me home 
A girl can get lonely out here on the road

You see Some days I find the old ways 
Frighten me too easily 
I leave my key and say "I'm too young"
But loverboy
If you call me home
I'll come driving fast as wheels can turn
