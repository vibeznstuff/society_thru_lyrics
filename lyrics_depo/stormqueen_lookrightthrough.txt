Talk to me, baby
Talk to me, baby
Talk to me, baby
Talk to me, baby.

I'm quite sure, 
that you never knew,
All the pain that I've been through.
Even this morning, 
looked outside my door, 
For your letter on the floor, 
Seven long years, 
Of moving on the streets,
Letting people in,
But they don't talk to me,


They look right through,
That morning, 
They don't talk to me me right,
That morning,
They don't talk to me me right,
That morning,
They don't talk to me me right, 
That morning, 
They don't talk to me me right,
That morning,
They don't talk to me me right, 
That morning, 
They don't talk to me, 
They look right through.

Sun comes up, 
I'm alone again,
With the lights on in my head, 
Still hours away,
From my little room,
'Cos I gotta go back soon,
Other people's lives,
All along goodbyes, 
Watching in the mirror,
With longing in my eyes,



Why can't you change your mind?
Look right through me all the time,
I'm gonna give you every part of me,
But you just wanted to be free yeah,



Just like you (just like you)
Look right through me (look right through)
