HERE IT COMES, YOU'RE NEVER GONNA TOP IT
ON A RUN, NO WAY YOU CAN STOP IT
TOTAL STYLE, PERFECTION IN DECAY
RUNNING WILD, FLAT OUT ALL THE WAY

NOW YOU CAN RIDE IT HIGH
AND YOU CAN LIGHT THE WAY
LIFT UP YOUR HANDS IN PRAISE
YOU CAN'T STOP ROCK 'N' ROLL 
YOU CAN'T STOP ROCK 'N' ROLL 
YOU CAN'T STOP ROCK 'N' ROLL 

LIKE A CHARGING BULL, IT'S A JUGGERNAUT
WITH STEAM AT FULL, NEVER TO BE CAUGHT
INCARNATE POWER, ROARING FROM THE SKY
WHILE OTHERS COWER, ROCK AIN'T GONNA DIE

NOW YOU CAN RIDE IT HIGH
AND YOU CAN LIGHT THE WAY
LIFT UP YOUR HANDS IN PRAISE
YOU CAN'T STOP ROCK 'N' ROLL 
YOU CAN'T STOP ROCK 'N' ROLL 
YOU CAN'T STOP ROCK 'N' ROLL 

IT'S AN ANGRY STEED,
ON A NEVER ENDING COURSE
WITH GRACE AND SPEED
IT'S AN UNRELENTING FORCE
HIS HEAD THROWN BACK, DEFIANTLY PROUD
UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK,
IT'S BLASTING, FAST AND LOUD

NOW YOU CAN RIDE IT HIGH
AND YOU CAN LIGHT THE WAY
LIFT UP YOUR HANDS IN PRAISE
YOU CAN'T STOP ROCK 'N' ROLL 
YOU CAN'T STOP ROCK 'N' ROLL 
YOU CAN'T STOP ROCK 'N' ROLL 

CAN'T STOP, CAN'T YOU STOP IT
CAN'T STOP YOU CAN'T STOP IT
CAN'T STOP, CAN'T YOU STOP IT
CAN'T STOP YOU CAN'T STOP IT
CAN'T STOP, CAN'T YOU STOP IT
CAN'T STOP YOU CAN'T STOP IT
CAN'T STOP, CAN'T YOU STOP IT
CAN'T STOP YOU CAN'T STOP IT
