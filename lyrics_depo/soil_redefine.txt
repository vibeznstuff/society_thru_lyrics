FIRST SIGHT
Turns me around again
Brings me face to face with my sin
I've got it, always had it
A reason to look within now
TAKE FLIGHT
To your sun again
Burns the sin straight from my hands
I've got it, always had it
A reason to live within now


Every time I fall
You catch me
And every time I lose control
You help me, you save me
And every time I lose myself
You find me, redefine me

MY GOD
How stained my hands have been
Makes me sick from inside out again
I've got it, always had it
A reason to look within now
STAND CLOSE
To my side again
Never stuck a knife in my back, friend
I've got it, always had it
A reason to live within now


Every time I fall
You catch me
And every time I lose control
You help me, you save me
And every time I lose myself
You find me, redefine me

Somebody to make me feel whole again
(my life gets better)
Somebody to make me want to love again
(my life gets better)
Somebody to make me see the sun again
(my life gets better)
Somebody to hold me, hold me
Until this life feels better
Every time I fall
And every time I lose control
You help me, you save me
And every time I lose myself
You find me, redefine me
And every time I hate myself
You love me, forgive me
And every time I lose myself
You find me, redefine me
