There's no goin' back to that
I'm so numb, can't even react
Didn't say it's not ok
But we aren't dealin' the same way 

I ain't tellin' you a secret
I ain't tellin' you goodbye 

It's the last thing on my mind
Still you won't let things unwind
Spinnin' tight around your head
Can't you hear a word I've said 

I ain't tellin' you a secret
I ain't tellin' you goodbye 

When you call it's just not fair
It's the last thing you should share
I can't deal, I'll let you know
Still I wish you'd let it go 

I ain't tellin' you a secret
I ain't tellin' you goodbye 

I'm tellin' you for one last time
It's not just you
The problem's mine to hide
I waited as long as I could
If you need it, sure I would
That's fine

Well, there's no goin' back to that
I'm so numb can't even react
Didn't say it's not ok
But we aren't dealin' the same way 

I ain't tellin' you a secret
I ain't tellin' you goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye 

I'm tellin' you for one last time
It's not just you
The problem's mine to hide 

I waited as long as I could
If you need it, sure I would
That's fine 

I'm takin' away a lot of stuff
I'm tellin' you it's rough
But not goodbye
