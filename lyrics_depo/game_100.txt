Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib
It was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin' there talkin' 'bout life
Play some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing

Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
Cause you were out of town
Nigga like Biggie heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got LA unified, you're better off committing suicide
Teachers ain't testin' us
See I know how it feel to be platinum plus
Niggas is jealous of you so they try to wrap you up
Tat you up, but it's OVO blood money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catchin' the bus
Dark fame is a mothafucka
Do a nigga four favors, when you can’t do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny's house
Leave you lyin' like Fif'
How a nigga supposed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walk around the crib like..
Why a nigga can’t live? Get this money, fuck these bitches
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like
We can pass these motherfuckin' straps like a physical
This my city, nigga everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four pounds
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hope I ain't gotta show it
LA niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Yo 40 I'm fucked up


Y'all better not come to my studio wit' that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral wit' that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever ask is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100


Thank me later, thanks for nothin'
Thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearing your true colors to every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they was skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop
And I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Nobody's even hearin' it on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself


Y'all better not come to my studio wit' that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral wit' that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever ask is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100

Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil Snupe, I was Meek Mill, nigga
Know how it feel when you're missin' your nigga though
Can't think so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figueroa
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, "Here it go"
Screamin' Frog's name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with me
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
LA niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter dawg cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga


Y'all better not come to my studio wit' that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral wit' that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever ask is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100
