Sha-la-la-la


He might got the biggest ca-ar-r,
Don't mean he can drive me wild or he can go for miles.
Said he got a lot of ca-a-ash,
Darling he can't buy my love, it's you I'm dreaming of.


They try to romance me
But you've got that nasty
And that's what I want (That's what I want)
So baby, baby,
Come and save me
Don't need those other numbers
When I got my number one.


Last night I lay in bed so blue
Cause I realized the truth, they can't love me like you
I tried to find somebody new
Baby they ain't got a clue, can't love me like you.


(Ah) Used to get it when I wa-a-ant.
You were pouring out your love, I could never get enough
Now I'm dealing with these bo-o-ys
When I really need a man who can do it like I can


They try to romance me
But you've got that nasty
And that's what I want (that's what I want)

Cause I realized the truth, they can't love me like you

Baby they ain't got a clue, can't love me like you
Sha-la-la-la, woo-oo, sha-la-la-la, oh oh oh oh oh
Sha-la-la-la, oh woo, can't love me like you oh oh oh
Sha-la-la-la, woo, sha-la-la-la, oh
Sha-la-la-la, oh, can't love me like you

Love the way you give it to me


When you're with me.


Boy I want it everyday
