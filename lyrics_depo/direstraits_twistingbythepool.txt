We're going on a holiday now
Gonna take a villa, a small chalet
Costa del Magnifico
Yo, cost of living is so low

Yeah, gonna be so neat
Dance to the Euro beat
Yeah, gonna be so cool
Twisting by the, twisting by the
By the pool

We're twisting by the pool
We're twisting by the pool
Twisting, twisting by the pool

Sitting in a small cafe now
Swing, swing, swingin' to the cabaret
You wanna see a movie, take in a show now
Meet new people at the disco

Yeah, gonna be so neat
Dance to the Euro beat
Yeah, gonna be so cool
Twisting by the, we're twisting by the
By the pool

Twisting by the pool
Twisting by the pool
Yeah, twisting, twisting by the pool

And we can still get information
Reading all about inflation
And you're never gonna be out of reach
There's a call-box on the beach

So one, a two
A one, a two, a three
Alright

We're just twisting by the pool
And we're twisting by the pool
You got me twisting by the pool
Yeah, twisting, twisting by the pool

You're gonna look so cute
Sunglasses and bathing suites
Be the baby of my dreams
Like the ladies in the magazine

Yeah, gonna be so neat
Dance to the Euro beat
Oh yeah, gonna be so cool
Twisting by the, we're just twisting by the
Oh, by the pool, twisting by the pool

I'm a twisting fool
Just twisting, yeah twisting
Twisting by the pool

Everybody got to do the twisting by the pool
And we're twisting by the pool
You got me twisting by the pool
Oh, twisting, twisting by the pool

And we're twisting by the pool
You got me twisting by the pool
Oh, twisting, twisting by the pool

Everybody got to do the twisting by the pool
And we're twisting by the pool
You got me twisting by the pool
Oh, twisting, twisting by the pool

Come and do the twisting by the pool
Twisting, twisting by the pool
