This is our last goodbye 
I hate to feel the love between us die 
But it's over 
Just hear this and then i'll go 
You gave me more to live for 
More than you'll ever know 

This is our last embrace 
Must I dream and always see your face 
Why can't we overcome this wall 
Well, maybe it's just because i didn't know you at all 

Kiss me, please kiss me 
But kiss me out of desire, babe, and not consolation 
You know it makes me so angry 'cause i know that in time 
I'll only make you cry, this is our last goodbye 

Did you say 'no, this can't happen to me,' 
And did you rush to the phone to call 
Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind 
Saying maybe you didn't know him at all 
You didn't know him at all, oh, you didn't know 

Well, the bells out in the church tower chime 
Burning clues into this heart of mine 
Thinking so hard on her soft eyes and the memories 
Offer signs that it's over... it's over
