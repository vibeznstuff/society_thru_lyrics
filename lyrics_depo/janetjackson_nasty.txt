Gimme a beat! Sittin' in the movie show, thinkin' nasty thoughts, huh
Better be a gentlemen or you turn me off, huh
That's right, a-let me tell it

Nasty
Nasty boys, don't mean a thing, huh
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty
Nasty boys, don't ever change, huh
Oh you nasty boys

I don't like no nasty car, I don't like a nasty food, huh
Ooh ooh yeah
The only nasty thing I like is the nasty groove, huh
Will this one do?
Uh huh, I know

Nasty
Nasty boys, don't mean a thing, huh
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty
Nasty boys, don't ever change, huh
Oh you nasty boys

Nasty boys, give me your nasty groove, huh
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty
Nasty boys, let me see your nasty body move, huh
Oh you nasty boys

I could learn to like this
Listen up.

I'm not a prude (no)
I just want some respect (that's right)
So close the door if you want me to respond (ooh ooh yeah)
'Cause privacy is my middle name
My last name is Control
No my first name ain't baby
It's Janet
Miss Jackson if you're nasty

Nasty
Nasty boys, don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty
Nasty boys, don't ever change, huh
Oh you nasty boys

Nasty boys, don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys
Don't mean a thing to me, uh

Don't mean a thing, huh
Oh you nasty boys
Uh!

Don't mean a thing

Oh you nasty boys
