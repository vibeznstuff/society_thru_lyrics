Mmmmmmmm
Let me talk to 'em
Let me talk to 'em
Let it rain
Mmmmmmm
Let me talk to 'em
C'mon!


Shawty had them apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (hey)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low


I ain't never seen nothing that'll make me go
This crazy all night spending my dough
Had the million dollar vibe and a body to go
Them birthday cakes they stole the show
So sexual
She was flexible professional
Drinking X&amp;O
Hold up, wait a minute, do I see what I think? Whoa
Did her thing. I seen shawty get low
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain I'm making it snow
Work the pole I got the bank roll
I'mma say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that I love women exposed
She threw it back at me I gave her more
Cash ain't a problem I know where it go
She had them

Hey shawty what I gotta do to get you home
My jeans full of guap and they're ready for shones
Cadillacs Maybach for the sexy grown
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack (come on), two stacks (come on), three stacks (come on)
Now that's three grand
What you think I'm playing, baby girl, I'm the man
I'll bend the rubber bands
That's what I told her
Her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over
That Henny and Cola got me like a soldier
She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her
So lucky on me I was just like a clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster
She showed her

Whoa, shawty, yeah, she was worth the money
Little mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got all them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that
I was on it, sexy woman
Let me show it make me want it
Two in the morning I'm zoned in
Them Ros√© bottles foaming
She wouldn't stop
Made it drop
Shawty did that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gal was fine just like my Glock
