We're self imploding
Under the weight of your advice
I wear a suitcase
Under each one of my eyes

Finally I know now what it takes
It takes money and aeroplanes


If you love me let me go
Back to that bar in Tokyo
Where the demons from my past
Leave me in peace
(ah ah ah ah)
I'll be animating every night
The grass will be greener on the other side
And the Vampires and Wolves
Won't sink their teeth
(ah ah ah ah)
I'm sick of dancing with the beast

Astrophysics you'll never be my closest friend
I find no comfort in what my mind can't comprehend

Finally I work out what it takes
It takes money and aeroplanes


If you love me let me go
Back to that bar in Tokyo
Where the demons from my past
Leave me in peace
(ah ah ah ah ah)
I'll be animating every night
The grass will be greener on the other side
And the Vampires and Wolves
Won't sink their teeth
(ah ah ah ah ah)
I'm sick of dancing with the beast

No matter how much it needs me
Go and follow someone else's lead


If you love me let me go
Back to that bar in Tokyo
Where the demons from my past
Leave me in peace
(ah ah ah ah)
I'll be animating every night
The grass will be greener on the other side
And the Vampires and Wolves
Won't sink their teeth
(ah ah ah ah ah)
I'm sick of dancing with the beast
