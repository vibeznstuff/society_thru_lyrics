So beautiful, all so natural

Cause her mama lookin' so hot, packin' that heat
So be a good girl and thank yo mama

Look out, look out here she come now 
Look out, look out here she come

You sittin' in the temptation

You betta thank ya mama, cause girl you the one

Maybe cause your beauty keep the dudes unsprung
