Went to a party
I danced all night
I drank 16 beers
And I started up a fight 

But now I am jaded 
You're out of luck
I'm rolling down the stairs
Too drunk to fuck 

Too drunk to fuck
Too drunk to fuck
Too drunk, to fuck
I'm too drunk, too drunk, too drunk
To fuck 

I like your stories
I love your gun
Shooting out truck tires
Sounds like loads and loads of fun 

But in my room
Wish you were dead
You ball like the baby
In Eraserhead 

Too drunk to fuck
Too drunk to fuck
Too drunk, to fuck
It's all I need right now
Too drunk to fuck 

Too drunk to fuck
Too drunk to fuck
Too drunk, to fuck
I'm sick soft gooey and cold 
Too drunk to fuck 

I'm about to drop
My head's a mess
The only salvation is 
I'll never see you again 

You give me head
It makes it worse
Take out your fuckin' retainer
Put it in your purse 

I'm too drunk to fuck
You're to drunk to fuck
Too drunk to fuck
It's all I need right now Oh baby
I'm melting like an ice cream bar
Oh baby 

And now I got diarrhea
Too drunk to fuck
Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah
Oooohhh
