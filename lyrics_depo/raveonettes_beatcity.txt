Wanna Die In Beat City And Run, Run, Run
Wanna Hang With Girls And Shoot My Gun
Wanna Catch The Rays Off The Sun
Wanna Drink And Drive And Have Some Fun

Wanna Die In Beat City And Go, Go, Go
You Can't Come With Me Cause You're Just Too Slow
Inject The Stars Make Them Glow
Put Up A Fight And Put On A Show

Wanna Die In Beat City
Wanna Die In Beat City
Wanna Die In Beat City
Wanna Die In Beat City
