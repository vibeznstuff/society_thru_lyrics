(S. Kipner/P. Bliss)
My mouth is dry, my legs are weak
I'm thinking this cause I can't speak
I'm looking at you, you're looking at me
You must think that I'm just crazy

If you only knew what you're putting me through
It feels like a heart attack
You're giving me a heart attack
Heart attack
You're giving me a heart attack
Must have died and gone to heaven
What a way to go

I can't catch my breath
You must be a dream
But you're the cutest thing I've ever seen
I'm way past the point of recovery
You're gonna be the death of me

If you only knew what you're putting me through
It feels like a heart attack
You're giving me a heart attack
Heart attack
You're giving me a heart attack
Must have died and gone to heaven
What a way to go
A heart attack
You're giving me a heart attack
Heart attack
You're giving me a heart attack
You're giving me a heart attack
You're giving me a heart attack
