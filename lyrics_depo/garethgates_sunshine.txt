I'm the first to complain about the rain 
'Cause I don't like it like that, 
But when I see the sunshine breaking through the clouds 
I'm lovin' the rest of the day. 

Come take a walk with me 
We'll take our time as we 
Watch our cares float away 
This is a time when I 
Don't even have to try 
Hope this happens today 

Whatcha gonna do about it 
Whatcha gonna say when I say 
Baby, it's just one of those days 
Whatcha gonna do today 
You can see that I'm smiling 
There's no denying 
'Cos the sun is shining 
Whatcha gonna do today 
Whatcha gonna do today 

Since the clouds up above obstruct the sun 
I'll be waiting indoors (I'll be waiting) 
But when I see the sunshine breaking through the clouds 
I'm lovin' the rest of the day. 

Come take a walk with me 
We'll take our time as we 
Watch our cares float away 
This is a time when I 
Don't even have to try 
Hope this happens today 

Whatcha gonna do about it 
Whatcha gonna say when I say 
Baby, it's just one of those days 
Whatcha gonna do today 
You can see that I'm smiling 
(Baby) There's no denying 
'Cos the sun is shining 
Whatcha gonna do today 
Whatcha gonna do today 

Whatcha gonna do? 
Whatcha gonna do today 

Whatcha gonna do? 
Whatcha gonna do today 

Are you gonna tell me baby 
Tell me whatcha gonna do 

Baby tell me 

Whatcha gonna do about it 
Whatcha gonna say when I say 
Baby, it's just one of those days 
Whatcha gonna do today 

Tell me! 

You can see that I'm smiling 
There's no denying 
'Cos the sun is shining 
Whatcha gonna do today 

Whatcha gonna do about it 
Whatcha gonna say when I say 
Baby, it's just one of those days 
Whatcha gonna do today 

I'm in love with you 

You can see that I'm smiling 
There's no denying 
'Cos the sun is shining 
Whatcha gonna do today 

Whatcha gonna do about it 
Whatcha gonna say when I say 
Baby, it's just one of those days 
Whatcha gonna do today
