Someone should tell her
How much I love her
Before she goes and
Runs away with him
If you should see her
Tell her I need her
Maybe then
She'll come back to me

Ever since I broke her heart
She won't talk to me
All I need is a one last chance
To make up and say I'm sorry

Someone should tell her
How much I love her
Before she goes and
Runs away with him
If you should see her
Tell her I need her
Maybe then
She'll come back to me

I've never been the kind
To get down on my knees
If she could see me now
A lonely man who's begging please

Someone should tell her
How much I love her
Before she goes and
Runs away with him
If you should see her
Tell her I need her
Maybe then
She'll come back to me

Someone should tell her
How much I love her
Before she goes and
Runs away with him
If you should see her
Tell her I need her
Maybe then
She'll come back to me
Maybe then
She'll come back to me
Maybe then
She'll come back to me
