You know you want me
You want this

My girls
Been goin 'round talkin
They say that you been
Watchin me boy
I know
By the way you're talkin
That you're really tryin
To get to me boy

Not anyone I'll just let in my heart
You have to be hungry for me
Girls may have been easy
But you have to please me
What makes me think that I can say this to you
I know how bad you want this


If you want my future then
You better work it boy
No it won't come easy no
I know you want this
By the time I'm through with you
You'll be beggin me for more

You want this

I know
Your whole story
Because you're fine and
And you know it
You think
That you can have me
Just listen closely
No it ain't so easy
Every word
You've said I have heard before

Girls may have been easy
But you have to please me
One thing I've been told
Nothin else compares
To this lovin body



So you want my lovin no
I know you want this



You want this
Don't you
You want this
Say it

You know it's just true
You want this
You know it

You know it's just true
You want this
You know it

You want this?

Can you handle this?
Well come here then

Early in the mornin

Late in the evenin

Just about around midnight

Cause you know I'll do you right baby
