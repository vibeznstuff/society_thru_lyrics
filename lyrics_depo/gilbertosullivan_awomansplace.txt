I may be old fashioned
So what if I am
I'm not any different
To any other man
I'm not one of those
Who look for blood from a stone
But I believe
A woman's place is in the home.

Now I'm not one to kid you
You know it's not my style
I wouldn't want to hurt you
Not even for a while
I'm all for a woman
Who can make it on her own
But I believe
A woman's place is in the home.
Ooh baby I believe, I do
A woman's place is in the home.

Wonder what would have happened
Had a woman flattened
Rocky Marciano's nose
Would there have been
A change of views
Would women no longer be used
The way they seem
To think they're being

I know what you're thinking
And you've every right to moan
But I believe, yes indeed, I do,
A woman's place is in the home.
Ooh baby I believe, I do
A woman's place is - in the home
