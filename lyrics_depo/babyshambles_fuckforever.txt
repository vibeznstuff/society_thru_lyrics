Its one and the same, one and the same oh, 
So whats the use between death and glory? 
How can you choose between death and glory? 
Happy endings, no, they never bored me 
Happy endings, they still don't bore me 
But they, they have a way 
They have a way to make you pay 
And to make you toe the line 
Sever the ties 
Because I'm so clever 
But clever ain't wise 

Fuck forever 
If you don't mind 
Oh fuck forever? 
If you dont mind, dont mind,i dont mind,i dont mind 

Oh whats the use between death and glory? 
I cant tell between death and glory? 
New labour and Tory 
Purgatory and no happy families 

Its one and the same, one and the same 
No, its not the same 
Its not supposed to be the same 
You know about that way 
The way they make you pay 
And the way they make you toe the line 
I've severed my ties 
Oh, you're so clever, you're so clever 
But you're not very nice 
So fuck forever 
If you don't mind 
Oh I'm stuck forever 
In your mind, your mind, your mind 

But have you heard about that way, 
To make you feel I should soon make you pay 
And to make you toe the line, line 
I Sever my ties 
Oh well i never 
Sever the ties 
And fuck forever 
If you don't mind 
See i'm stuck forever 
Oh i'm stuck in your mind, your mind, your mind 

I never played this on the radio 
Oh they never played this on the radio.
