Just because you don't believe that I wanna dance
Don't mean that I don't want to
Just because you don't believe that I wanna dance
Don't mean that I don't want to



I don't believe that you wanna get up and dance
I don't believe that you wanna get up and dance

I don't believe that you wanna get up and dance
I don't believe that you wanna get up and dance
