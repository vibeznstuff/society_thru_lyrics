If I had one single wish,
I'd go back to the moment I kissed
You goodbye
No matter how hard I try,
I can't live without you in my life

Maybe you’ll say you still want me
Maybe you’ll say that you don't
Maybe we said it was over
Baby, I can't let you go

I walk around try to understand
Where we were wrong and I can't pretend
It wasn't me, it wasn't you
But I'm convinced we gave up too soon

Maybe you’ll say you still want me
Maybe you’ll say that you don't
Maybe we said it was over
Baby, I can't let you go

Nothing left to lose after losing you
There's nothing I can take
When I run to you, when I come for you
Don't tell me I'm too late

Maybe you’ll say you still want me
Maybe you’ll say that you don't
Maybe we said it was over
Baby, I can't let you go

(Maybe you’ll say you still want me)
(Maybe you’ll say that you don't)
(Maybe we say it was over)
Can't let you go
(Baby I can't let you go)
Can't let you go
(Maybe we said it was over)
Can't let you go
(Baby I can't let you go)
Can't let you go
