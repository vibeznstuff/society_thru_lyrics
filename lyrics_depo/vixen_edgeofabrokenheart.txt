I can't believe I could've been so blind, but love is strange
I thought about it for a long long time, but the truth remains
I don't need another lonely night to dry my tears
The answer's plain as black and white, and I can see the picture very clear


I been living on the edge of a broken heart
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl
I been living on the edge of a broken heart
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye

It isn't like you never had the chance to change your tune
Did you think that I'm a dime a dance, well the dance is through
I been doing things your way too long, but baby that's over (baby that's over)
It won't be easy, but I gotta be strong
And if I wanna cry I don't need your shoulder



I'll find someone else who's nothing like you
And who can play the game as well
And you're gonna be sorry baby - when it's over



I been doing things your way too long, baby that's over (baby that's over)
It won't be easy, but I've got to be strong
And if I wanna cry I don't need your shoulder



I been living on the edge of a broken heart
I been living on the edge of a broken heart
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye
I been living on the edge of a broken heart
