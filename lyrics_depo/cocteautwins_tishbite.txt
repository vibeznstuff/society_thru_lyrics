I'm at a loss
I don't know what to do 
Feel like a waterless Nile
Come here just hold me
To feel safe enough to some
Daring to senses sure
A fable look what happens when
I don't risk losing you
There's no guarantee
How are we to know if the response is coming
I'm in the wrong place
Is it like a, is it like a
Is it like a dream
How does it, how does it seem grounded and real
(deep background voice)Seem very untrue
Is it like a, Is it like a, is it like a dream
How does it, how does it seem grounded and real
(deep background voicee)Seem very untrue
I feel a connection, a deep connection
But it's not reflected
In time spent together
It's reflected cycle
Clear imaginary
Is it like a, is it like a, is it like a dream
(this mountain of pleasure)
How does it, how does it, seem grounded and real
(oh oh I want to get lost in it)
Is it like a, is it like a, is it like a dream
(sleeping like a baby)
How does it, how does it, seem grounded and real
(stay close, stay close)
Is it like a, is it like a, is it like a dream
How does it, how does it, seem grounded and real
(oh until I don't know where you end and, I begin
Until I just, carry it in me carry it in me carry it in me
I wanna get lost)
