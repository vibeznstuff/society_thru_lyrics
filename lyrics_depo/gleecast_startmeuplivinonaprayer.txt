Start me up 
Start me up 

Tommy used to work on the docks 
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck. 
It's tough, oh so tough 

We gotta hold on ready or not 
You live the for the fight when that's all that you've got 

Start me up 
We're half way there 
Oh livin' on a prayer 

Start me up 
We'll make it I swear 
Oh livin' on a prayer 

If you start me up (uh) 
Kick on the starter give it all you got, you got, you got 
I can't compete with riders in the other heat, yeah yeah 

I'll make a grown man cry, 
I'll make a grown man give it a shot 

Start me up 
We're half way there 
Oh livin' on a prayer 

Start me up 
We'll make it I swear 
Oh, livin' on a prayer 

Livin' on a prayer 



Oh, we gotta hold on, ready or not 
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got 

Start me up 
Oh, we're half way there 
Oh, livin' on a prayer 
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear, 
Oh livin' on a prayer 

Start me up 
If you start me up I'll never stop (I'll never stop) 
Livin' on a prayer 
Take my hand and we'll make it I swear 
Oh, livin on a prayer 

Oh, we're half way there 
Oh, livin' on a prayer 
Take my hand and we'll make it I swear, 
Oh livin' on a prayer (we're almost there) 

Livin' on a prayer 
You gotta start me up
