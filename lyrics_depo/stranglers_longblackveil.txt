Life was good for a short while
Hot sweet nights days that were fine
Spent many hours just looking at you
Heart stopped beating for a moment or two
Long black veil now you are mine

Sun went down never to rise
Lost in tears filling my eyes
Saw my love trampled deep in the dirt
Overwhelmed by the bitterest hurt
Long black veil now you are mine

I've lately felt a stirring
Of ghosts around my mind
And I'm frightened of the things that I might find
The veil of black that claimed you
And took you from my sight
Has marched across the sands of time tonight
