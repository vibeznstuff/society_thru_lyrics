I still didn't believe


You so damn important
Everything you do shows me you know it
Behind it all, you are the motive
Don't tell you enough, but baby I'll show it, show it
He say the king where he come from
Takes a young queen just to know one
So baby I'm a drive it like it's stolen
I'm a fix it like it's broken
We can catch a flight out to London
Go to the mall spend a lump sum
They can try to catch up to us
But they're too busy making assumptions


(Boy you know)
All I do
Is stay up all night, losing sleep over you
All I do
Is drive myself crazy, thinking about my baby


It's the way you walk, the way you talk, babe (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's the way you love, the way you fuck, the way (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's the way you are; you're a star babe (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's the way you, the way you, oh


She said, "I ain't even make my bed up.
Watch your step: you gon' wake my mama and dad up."
Pshh girl, didn't I tell you at the damn club
We gon' wake your neighbors
Turn your block club to my fan club
And it happened so fast
Damn, I'm glad I strapped up
Ask her when she finished, if she came
She said I lapped ya twice, uh
Run it back for the door, rematch
Flip the crib when we fuck, Remax
It get hot den a mug, glass cup
You can ask her if I fuck, she gassed (huh)
I gotta keep it a secret, I keep a key in my lower pocket
Inside a register below the lower octave
Dirty laundry in my closet, they be strung out on the street
Left to dry with dry sheets and no deposit
They don't gotta worry, put my hand on your mouth
Put my hands in your mouth, girl
We got plans at my house, you know the way up




This thing we got is crazy
Only thing I know is you're my baby
Forever down, I am your lady
Always for sure, never a maybe, uh-uh
Never met someone who spoke my language
Never met a nigga done with playin'
You the type of nigga make me lane switch
Hand me the brush and say paint it
Give me your heart, and I'll hold it
Show me your soul, and I'll mold it
Baby boy you gotta be the dopest
Gotta be to fuck with the coldest
