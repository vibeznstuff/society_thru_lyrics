Let's kick it ese

COMMIN' OUT DA SLUMS!!!
It's da hoodlums
I'm pullin' my gat out on all you bums
So bring it on when you wanna come fight this
Outlaw, I'll kick ya like Billy Ray Cypress Hill
Kill, I'll bust that grill
Grab my gat, and load up the steel
And if you wanna get drastic
I'll pull out my blasted glock, automatic,
Synthetic material, bury your blocks-n-mortar
Headed down to da Mexican border
Smokin' that smellie, Northern Cali,
Gonna put a slug in Captain O'Malley
Ho, hum-Hear the gat come
Boooooommmmmm!
Let me see what you'll do when you're sent to kill a man
But I'll be damned if I don't take a stand
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
"We ain't goin' out!"
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
"We ain't goin' out!"
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
"We ain't goin' out!"
We ain't goin' out like that
"We ain't goin' out like that!"

I'm high strung
Click I'm sprung
'Cause I don't live on the hum-drum
Where I'm from the gats'll be smokin'
I'll be damned if ya think I'm jokin'
Know that I come with the static, erratic, .45 automatic
Screamin' at ya-the red lights beamin' at ya
No need to run after the punk-ass who'd run up to my crew
Dig the grave for the one who got played
Now he's under
Don't make me wonder why 'cause you'll testify
We ain't goin' out like that

I got to thinkin' "What the fuck is this?"
Lettin' you know I take care of business
Can I get a witness?
To verify when I'm to bring this style
That makes you ecstatic
Tragic, when I get a poof of the magic buddha
When I roll with my crew
I betcha one time can't find my hooda!
Hits'll be hitting with the belt unbuckled (I don't know this line)
Pig rollin' up but he ain't that subtle
Pulled to da curb
So we exchange a few words
But he got me stirred up
"Ought not to grab the handcuffs.
I'll huff-n-puff-n-blow ya head of!"
We ain't goin' out like that

EAT A BOWL OF DICK UP!! GEEEYEAH!!


Yeah takin' your disses and dissin' ya right back
This is the Cypress Hill crew, like main shit
Yo and I'm talk this damn rappa
Eat a bowl a dick up, there ya go my man over here
You can eat a bowl o' dick up too
Anybody else need from runnin' away
Yo, eat a bowl of dick up G!
