When all have lost faith in you
'cos the dice you threw didn't show your number
And they all think your winning days are through
I'll be there to pick you up.
Your confidence mustn't start to drop

I'll take my chance 'cos I have faith in you.
So spin the wheel
Call your number - lucky my stakes on you
We may lose but the game we must play and it's true.
Life's the dealer and your cards I cannot see

Out all on earth I'll take my chances on you.

Take my chances on you - take my chances on you
Take my chances on you - take my chances on you
When all your so called friends used to call

Forget your number 'cos they all think	
You're a star fallen from the sky.
I'll be there right by your side my love
For you cannot be denied I'll see it through
'cos I believe in you.
So roll the dice
Call your number
Lucky I'm there with you.
We may lose but the game we must play
And it's true lifes kicked you down
And your heart is filled with pain
But of all on earth Ill take my chances on you.
Take my chances on you - take my chances on you...
So roll the dice call your number
...
Take my chances on you - take my chances on you...
'cos I believe in you
Yeah.
Take my chances on you - take my chances on you...
