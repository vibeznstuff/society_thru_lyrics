I'm better
So much better now
I see the light, touch the light,
We're together now

I'm better
So much better now
Look to the skies, give me life
We're together now


We've only just begun
Hypnotized by drums
Until forever comes
You'll find us chasing the sun


They said this day wouldn't come
We refused to run
We've only just begun


You'll find us chasing the sun


Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You'll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You'll find us chasing the sun

When the daylight's fading
We're gonna play in the dark
'Til it's golden again
And now it feels so amazing
Can't see you coming
And we'll never grow old again

You'll find us chasing the sun


I'm never
I'm never down
Lying here, staring up
And you're looking down


I'm never
I'm never down
Live forever, forever
With you around


We've only just begun
Hypnotized by drums
Until forever comes
You'll find us chasing the sun


They said this day wouldn't come
We refused to run
We've only just begun
You'll find us chasing the sun


The sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun
 You'll find us
 chasing the sun


Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You'll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You'll find us chasing the sun


When the daylight's fading
We're gonna play in the dark
'Til it's golden again

And now it feels so amazing
Can't see you coming
And we'll never grow old again
You'll find us chasing the sun


You'll find us chasing the sun

You'll find us chasing the sun

You'll find us chasing the sun

You'll find us chasing the sun

You'll find us chasing the sun


When the daylight's fading
We're gonna play in the dark
'Til it's golden again

And now it feels so amazing
Can't see it coming
And we'll never grow old again
You'll find us chasing the sun


Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You'll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll find us chasing the sun
