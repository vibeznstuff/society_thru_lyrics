I can hear her heartbeat from a thousand miles
And the heaven's open every time she smiles
And when I come to her that's where I belong
Yet I'm running to her like a river song

She gimme love love love love crazy love
She gimme love love love love crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor
When I'm feeling lowdown
Yet when I come to her when the sun goes down
She takes away my troubles, takes away my grief
Takes away my heartache, go right to sleep

She gimme love love love love crazy love
She gimme love love love love crazy love
She gimme love love love love crazy love
She gimme love love love love crazy love

Yes I need her in the daytime
And I need her in the night
And I wanna holding my arms around her
And kiss and hug and kiss and hug her tight

And when I'm returning from so far away
She give me some sweet lovin'
Brighten up my day
Yet it make me righteous, ooh and it makes me whole
Yet it make me mellow down to my soul

She gimme love love love love crazy love
She gimme love love love love crazy love
