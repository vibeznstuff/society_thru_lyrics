I'm in the house
I'm in the house
I'm in the house
I'm in the house

Yo, yo

I'm in the house
House, house, house
House, house, house
House, house, house
House, house, house
House

I'm in the house
I'm in the mother freaking house
I step this side and turn it out
I got these honeys screaming, ow
Ow, ow, ow, ow

Yo
I walkin' through the fuck door
I ran in to DJ Aoki
Step to the boof and I say, "Yo"
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

Baby, I rock the mic and that's no secret
I'm Zuper Blahq on that unique shit
So don't be blinkin', don't be sleepin'
I be, I be all mine

You be jammin' to this beat
I rock it with ill technique
Slanging heat like slanging coke
A lil' small bang will make you weak

I could beat it up, repeat it
Back to, back to, back to, back to
Directly rock the dance floor
'Cause I'm Zuper, Zuper Blahq
I'm in the house

I'm in the house
I'm in the house
I'm in the house
House, house

I rock the place
I rock the place that's pumpin' bass
That kinda bass that make it shake
That seismic frequency
That make that earth quake
Hey, hey, hey

Let's go
Come on let's go
Let's go loco and lose control
Aoki rock that electro
That cobra snakes snap my photo
With those mono's, AO

I'm chillin' in the house like a 'G'
With the Bloody Beetroots rocking ill-frequencies
MSTRKRFT, 'Fist Of God', knock 'em out with ease
And the crazy fuck Crookers beak it down, down, down

Pase Rock in the house like, yo, yo, yo
Boys Noize in the house like, yo, yo, yo
LMFAO is in the house, yo, yo, yo
I'm Zuper, Zuper Blahq, I break it down, down, down
I'm in the house
