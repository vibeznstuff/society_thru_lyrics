If I was inordinately different to what you say
I'd lie, I would lie
If you could release me now
You know that I won't hesitate
To lie, I would lie

Bring it on, make it right
Bring it on to the light
Pick me up satellite
If it's wrong, make it right

Indecipherable gibberish kind of guitar

If I lied and told you they were difficult or hard to take
I'd lie, I'd still lie
If you try to please me now
You know that I won't remonstrate
But lie I would lie

Bring it on, make it right
Bring it on, to the light
Pick me up, satellite
If it's wrong, make it right

We like quiet nights on the island
Read by patterned stars round our head
We can reach new heights in this island
We're dragged slowly to our feet

Bring it on, make it right
Bring it out, to the light
Pick me up, satellite
If it's wrong, make it right

Bring it on, make it right
Bring it out, to the light
Pick me up, satellite
If it's wrong, make it right

If I was inordinately different
