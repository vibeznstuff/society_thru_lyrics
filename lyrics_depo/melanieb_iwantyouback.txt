 I'm the M to the E-L-B you know me.
 I'm the M-I-S-S-Y, with an E.
 And I've got flows from overseas.
 Well, how can you beep-beep with no keys?
 I've got spice. I'm tight with my flows.
 And all my flows have been known to go blow.
 Well let me hit this one before I go.
 Well I'll let you go if you say so

Boy I'm sick of you
Who me? Yes me. Yeah you know I'm a fool,
Oooh I'm a fool for you
Cauce I keep takin' you back as though I'm stupid like that
Yeah yeah you know we're through
But I can't say no and I never said no
Why I can't say no to yo, becauce you treat
me so wack and fact I want you back 


I think I want you back
Your love has made a deep impact
I know it might sound wack
But damn I think I want you back
Want you
I think I want you back
Your love has made a deep impact
I know it might sound wack
But damn I think I want you back 

Boy I'm tired of you
Runnin' over me tellin' me what to do
Now what have I done to you
To make you s** a lot I though I made you hot
Now don't make me act a fool
I know I talk mad junk but I know what I want
What I truly want is you
And even though you're a mack true dat I
want you back 


I think I want you back
Your love has made a deep impact
I know it might sound wack
But damn I think I want you back

You got me losin' my mind, my mind
You can't keep breakin' my heart
You got me drinkin' liquor in the mornin'
Sittin' all night at the bar
