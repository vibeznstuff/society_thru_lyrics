I tore my letter up
I couldn't even start
To tell you what's really in my heart.
There's only so much that words can say
So I sent you a piece of this beautiful day.
Oh
I want you to know that I took a rainbow
And sent it off in a letter to you.
Took some flowers in the spring
Made a sweet clover ring
And sent it off in a letter to you.
Took a song from the lark - the moon from the dark

A spark with the sparkling clew.
With a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love
I sent 'em off in a letter to you.
I took the mornin' sun peekin' through the trees
And the dandelion silk tangled in the breeze
I folded 'em up - sealed 'em with a kiss

It's the kind of letter that you can't resist.
Oh
I want you to know that I took a rainbow

In a day or two - just you wait and see

You're gonna get a special delivery.
You'll know the way I feel -
There can't be any doubt
When you open it up
And let the love spill out.

Oh
I want you to know
That I took a rainbow
You know
I sent 'em off
In a letter to you.
You know
I sent 'em off
In a letter to you
