Meet me in a restaurant
Meet me on the top of the world
Meet me and we'll talk
The language of love

I'll meet you anywhere you want
I'll meet you on a ballroom floor
Meet me and we'll float
To a level above

I wish you'd drop
What you're doing
And get on the case
We could blow this existence
Right out into space
And share a sweet isolation

Let's go there today
Go today, go today
Every way, anyway

Oh, let's go
Let's go, baby
Let's go, baby, come on
Let's go, baby
Let's go, baby, come on

Take your cue from now
I'm saying, baby, let's go
Will you listen to me
I'm saying, baby, come on now
Let's go 'cause
We can't hold back no more
There's no way

Meet you on a mountain top
I'll meet you at the end of the block
As long as we can talk
The language of love

I'll take you in my arms again
I'll take you to the edge of time
Together we can reach
For the heavens above

I wish you'd drop what you're doing
And get on the case
So we could blow this existence
Right out into space
And share a sweet isolation

Let's go there today
Go today, go today
Every way, right away

Oh, let's go
Let's go, baby
Let's go, baby, come on
'Cause baby I want your love
Let's go, baby
Let's go, baby, come on
'Cause baby I'm sayin'

Take your cue from now
I'm saying, baby, let's go
Will you listen to me
I'm saying, baby, come on now
Let's go 'cause
We can't hold back no more
There's no way

Meet me on the dance floor
And we'll dance to the rhythm
(Dance to the rhythm)
Get your feet in motion
And we'll dance to the rhythm
Dance to the rhythm
Dance to the rhythm of love, whoa

Oh, let's go
Let's go, baby
Let's go, baby, come on
'Cause baby I want your love
Let's go, baby
Let's go, baby, come on
'Cause baby I'm sayin'

Take your cue from now
I'm saying, baby, let's go
Will you listen to me
I'm saying, baby, come on now
Let's go 'cause
We can't hold back no
Let's go 'cause
We can't hold back no
Let's go 'cause
We can't hold back no more
There's no way

Let's go, baby
Let's go, baby, come on
Let's go, baby
Let's go, baby, come on

Let's go, baby
Let's go, baby, come on
Let's go, baby
Let's go, baby, come on
