Traveling through a tunnel under sea
You never know if it cracks in half
You're never ever gonna see me

But you can have it all if you like
You can have it all if you like
And you can pay for it the rest of your life

I wouldn't believe your wireless radio
If I had myself a flying giraffe
I'd have one in a box with a window

But you can have it all if you like
You can have it all if you like
And you can pay for it the rest of your

Life in the summers on its back
You have to agree that that's the crack
So take what you want
I'm not coming back

So you can have it all if you like
You can have it all if you like
And you can pay for it the rest of your life
