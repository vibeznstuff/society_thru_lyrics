Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah, woah, yeah 

I thought I found love 
With somebody else's girl, yeah 
Oooh 

Walkin 'round feeling so broken-hearted 
Lost in a different world 
Then you came in my life 
Bought me back to reality someday 
Now I don't need a fantasy 
You're the only one I need 

I found heaven, sweet heaven baby 
On the wings of love 
I found heaven, sweet heaven baby 
On the wings of love 
Ooooh 

I will never no I'll never 
I will never lose my way again 
Ooooh yeah 

I thought you'd soon be my girl 
But my imagination was running wild 
Ooooh 
I wouldn't listen to a single soul 
Deep in a sense of denial 
But then you rescued me baby 
Opened my eyes and made me see you babe 
What real love can be 

You're the angel that I need 

I found heaven, sweet heaven baby 
On the wings of love 
I found heaven, sweet heaven baby 
On the wings of love 
Ooooh 

I will never no I'll never 
I will never lose my way again 
Oh sweet baby 
Ooooh 

Oh, I see heaven in your eyes with me 
Yeah, yeah 
Oh baby 
Now I will give my lovin' faithfully 

Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah sweet baby 
Be my angel 

Heaven, sweet heaven baby 
On the wings of love 
I found heaven, sweet heaven baby 
On the wings of love 
Ooooh 

Sweet sweet baby 
I will never, no I'll never 
I will never lose my way again
