I don't know how to fit inside,
All you do is try and leave me behind,
I don't know what to do,
Because something is killing me,
I don't know how to turn you on,
All you do is try and lead me on,
I don't know what to do,
Because something here is telling me to kill you,
It's all gone wrong, It's all gone wrong,
It's falling perfect fumes,
It's all gone wrong, It's all gone wrong,
It's broken,
I don't know how to leave this life,
All I have is maybe suicide,
I don't know what to do,
Because something is killing me,
I don't know how to reach the top,
All you do is try to scrape me off,
I don't know what to do,
Because something here is telling me to kill you,
It's all gone wrong, It's all gone wrong,
It's falling perfect fumes,
It's all gone wrong, It's all gone wrong,
It's broken,
Never meant to hurt you, hurt you,
Never meant to hurt you, hurt,
It's all gone wrong, It's all gone wrong,
It's falling perfect fumes,
It's all gone wrong, It's all gone wrong,
It's broken,It's all gone wrong, It's all gone wrong,
It's falling perfect fumes,
It's all gone wrong, It's all gone wrong,
And I can't lose such a life.
