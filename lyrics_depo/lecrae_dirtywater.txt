Hold up, Hold up, Hold up
Y'all gone get me bowed up
When that beat hit it's like three kicks in
Yo knees up to yo nose, huh
You knows us
Un-a-shamed, Uno Uno Seis (whoa)
Tatted on my skin, all up in yo face (whoa)
If I ain't 'bout that life, then I ain't really livin'
But if you can't see my light then maybe I ain't in it
Champagne, champagne, celebratin' my campaign
I just dug a well in West Africa
But how many of my friends is Afri-can, huh?
No habla español (nope)
Just show me tu baño
Ain't tryna get to know you, I'm too busy readin' Daniel (woo!)
Most segregated time of day is Sunday service (My Lawd)
Now what you think that say about the God you worship? (ok)
First of all, I know it ain't a song that's gone change the world
There's no way
It's not a guilt trip, it's a field trip that's gonna last more than one day
What you thought, huh?
Faith ain't 'bout no soft stuff
I heard you just went overseas, now come back home and boss up


Buy a bottle for a fee (for a fee) dirty water
Bodies floatin' in the sea (in the sea) dirty water
Blood flowin' from the ground, dirty water
Dirty water

Buy a bottle for a fee (for a fee) dirty water
Bodies floatin' in the sea (in the sea) dirty water
Blood flowin' from the ground, dirty water
Ain't no filters in this town, dir-dir-dirty water

Worthless, worthless, 400 years we done heard that
My family came here on slaves ships
Some herd cattle, some herd blacks (woo!)
I know some of y'all done heard that
My kin was treated less than men (whoa)
That's why we raised to hate each other, cause we hate our skin
Lies you told about yourself that you don't realize (Like what?)
Must be a thief, she locked the doors when I was walking by (whoa)
They must be whores cause the master rapes 'em and leaves the child
So deadbeat daddy was taught to me way before my time
Now we extreme, buying fancy things like gold chains
Just pretty shackles, we still enslaved
Put 'em round ya neck, cause we still hangin'
Hood preacher told 'em they should live as kings (kin-kings)
You call 'em devil, he fightin' for self-esteem (Think about it)
It's hard to dream when yo water ain't clean
Now look at Lucifer scheme us out of being a team (whoa)
Blood in the ocean to these African streams
This dirty water ain't nothin' we haven't seen
