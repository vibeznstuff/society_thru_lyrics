Come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
When the weight of all the world is pushing down.
Nah nah nah cut this tension mate it's too much.

Situation volatile, seriously hostile
Breadwinners,
Soul searchers,
Fear merchants,
Seeking.
Brightly colored, no use for camouflage,
When you're venomous and willing to sabotage.
We're just a group of your white blood cells
Fighting off parasites
We're your system mechanics
Trying to fix this machine
What's the one thing that has
More speed, more strength,
And goes deeper than us?
A nuclear submarine.

Ah come on just open the door!

Knocked off my feet by the backdraft
Brought back to earth
Oxygen clears my head
And I just gotta say
Oh you're not gonna believe this
You can't perceive this
This is like nothing you've seen before
But lucky for you
Yea lucky for you
This is an open door

Come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
When the weight of all the world is pushing down.
Down on your shoulders
Come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
When the weight of all the world is pushing down
Just push right back!

Oh you're not gonna believe this
You can't perceive this
This is like nothing you've seen before
But lucky for you
Yea lucky for you
They're well prepared… but they forgot one thing
Yea yea we're nice guys… until we're not!

Come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
When the weight of all the world is pushing down
Down on your shoulders
Come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
When the weight of all the world is pushing down
Just push right back!

Come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
When the weight of all the world is pushing down
Come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
When the weight of all the world is pushing down
Just push right back!
Just push right back!
Just push right back!
