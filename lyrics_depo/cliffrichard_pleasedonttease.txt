You tell me that you love me baby
Then you say you don't
You tell me that you'll come on over
Then you say you won't
You love me like a hurricane
Then you start to freeze
I'll give it to you straight right now
Please don't tease

You come right out and tell me
You're out with someone new
You play it oh, so doggone cool
I don't know what to do
You never seem to answer me
You just don't here my plea
I'll give it to you one more time
Please don't tease

Oh, please don't tease me
You know it hurts so much
Come on and squeeze me
You know I need your tender touch

(But) You tell me that you love me baby
Then you say you don't
You tell me that you'll come on over
Then you say you won't
You love me like a hurricane
Then you start to freeze
I'll give it to you straight right now
Please don't tease

Oh, please don't tease me
You know it hurts so much
Come on and squeeze me
You know I need your tender touch

(But) You tell me that you love me baby
Then you say you don't
You tell me that you'll come on over
Then you say you won't
You love me like a hurricane
Then you start to freeze
I'll give it to you straight right now
Please don't tease
