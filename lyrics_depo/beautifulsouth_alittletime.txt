I need a little time to think it over
I need a little space just on my own
I need a little time to find my freedom
I need a little

Funny how quick the milk turned sour, isn't it, isn't it?
Your face has been looking like that for hours, hasn't it, hasn't it?
Promises, promises turn to dust
Wedding bells just turn to rust
Trust into mistrust

I need a little room to find myself
I need a little space to work it out
I need a little room all alone
I need a little

You need a little room for your big head, don't you, don't you?
You need a little space for a thousand beds, won't you, won't you?
Lips that promise fear the worst
Tongue so sharp the bubble burst
Just into unjust

I've had a little time to find the truth
Now I've had a little room to check what's wrong
I've had a little time and I still love you
I've had a little

You had a little time and you had a little fun, didn't you, didn't you?
While you had yours do you think I had none, do you, do you?
The freedom that you wanted back is yours for good, I hope you're glad
Sad into unsad

I had a little time to think it over
I had a little room to work it out
I've found a little courage to call it off
I've had a little time

I've had a little time
I've had a little time
I've had a little time
