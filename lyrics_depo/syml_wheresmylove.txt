Cold bones. Yeah, that's my love
She hides away, like a ghost

Does she know that we bleed the same?
Don't wanna cry but I break that way

Cold sheets. Oh, where's my love?
I am searching high, I'm searching low in the night

Does she know that we bleed the same?
Don't wanna cry but I break that way

Did she run away?
Did she run away? I don't know
If she ran away
If she ran away, come back home
Just come home

I got a fear, oh, in my blood
She was carried up into the clouds, high above

If you bled, I'll bleed the same
If you're scared, I'm on my way

Did you run away?
Did you run away? I don't need to know
If you ran away
If you ran away, come back home
Just come home
