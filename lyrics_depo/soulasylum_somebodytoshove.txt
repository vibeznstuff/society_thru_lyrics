Grandfather watches the grandfather clock
And the phone hasn't rang for so long
And the time flys by, like a vulture in the sky
Suddenly he breaks into song

I'm waiting by the phone
Waiting for you to call me up and tell me I'm not alone
I'm waiting by the phone
Waiting for you to call me up and tell me I'm not alone

Hello, speak up, is there somebody there?
These hang ups are getting me down
In a world frozen over with over exposure
Let's talk it over, let's go out and paint the town

Cause I'm waiting by the phone
Waiting for you to call me up and tell me I'm not alone
Cause I want somebody to shove
I need somebody to shove
I want somebody to shove me

You're a dream for insomniacs, prize in the Cracker Jack
All the difference in the world is just a call away

And I'm waiting by the phone
Waiting for you to call me up and tell me I'm not alone
Yes I'm waiting by the phone
I'm waiting for you to call me, call me
and tell me I'm, tell me I'm not alone

Cause I want somebody to shove
I need somebody shove
I want somebody to shove me
Yes I want somebody to shove
I need somebody shove
I want somebody to shove me
