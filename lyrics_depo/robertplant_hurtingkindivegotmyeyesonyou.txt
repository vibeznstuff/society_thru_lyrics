She's the girl of my dreams - she's the girl on my mind
She used to play me for a fool 'cause she's the hurting kind

I lost my heart in the East - another part in the West
You better jump back baby - you're the girl I love the best

I'm gonna ride the wind - there's nothing I won't do
I'm coming up real fast - I got my eyes on you

I see your eyes of love - well tell me what you see
I see your long black hair moving over me

Oh yes, I feel good now, now
Let's talk about love, let's talk about love
Let's talk about love, let's talk about it
Alright, alright, alright, I got my eyes on you
Alright, alright, alright, I got my eyes on you

I lost my heart over here - another part over there
I still got plenty left, and baby I don't care

Oh, let's talk about love, let's talk about love
Alright, alright, alright, I got my eyes on you
Alright, alright, alright, I got my eyes on you

Don't blame me - I won't hurt you - don't blame me
It's plain to see you know the real me

She's the girl of my dreams - she's the girl on my mind
She used to play me for a fool - she's the hurting kind

Gonna go around the world - nothing I won't do
Coming up real fast - I got my eyes on you
Alright, alright, alright, I got my eyes on you
Alright, alright, alright, I got my eyes on you --
