I don't need no doctor
'Cause I know what's ailing me
I don't need no doctor
'Cause I know what's ailing me (yes, I do)
All I need is my baby
You don't know I'm in misery
I don't need no doctor

I don't need no doctor
My prescription has been filled
I don't need no doctor
My prescription has been filled
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
All I need is my baby
You don't know I'm in misery
I don't need no doctor

Well, the doctor said I need the rest - ooh, ooh
He put me on the critical list - ooh, ooh
Keeping me safe from harm - ooh, ooh
All I need is her sweet charm - ooh, ooh
He gave me a medical option, that wouldn't do
Ooh, yeah, my motion, oh, yeah, no doctor, no
I don't need no doctor
