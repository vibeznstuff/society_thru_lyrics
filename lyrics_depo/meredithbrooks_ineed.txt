I need some good luck; I need a best friend
I need a rough dog; I need a mountain
I need some new clothes, a TV, a cause
A trip to Nirvana, the thrill of applause
I need a wet kiss, I need to confess
I need a vision, religion
The right to be silent, and then to be heard
A week on an island, a diet that works
I need a dose of the Bible
Another course in survival
Just talkin' 'bout the essentials 
It makes me feel alive 


That's all I need, see how easy I am to please
That's all I need, see how easy I am

I need some money, more money, and more time
A strong cup of coffee, a haircut, a lifeline
A stranger to trust me, my father to love me
Seattle, a sunburn, and lots of Todd Rundgren
I need a guitar, to do it on all fours
Cool friends, weekends, and someone to die for

When I'm alone on my couch, nothing can settle me down
I'm adding on to my list, it makes me feel alive



I need a Guru, I need to chill
I need a Mercedes 280SL
Yeah, that'll fix it, I'll be complete
I need a, I need a, I need a

That's all I need, see how easy I am to please
That's all I need, maybe then I will be complete
That's all I need, I'm not asking for everything
That's all I need, see how easy I am, I am
