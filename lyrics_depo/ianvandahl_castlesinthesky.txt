Do you ever question your life?
Do you ever wonder why?
Do you ever see in your dreams..
all the castles in the sky.

Oh, tell me why...
do we build castles in the sky.
Oh, tell me why...
all the castles way up high.
Please tell me why
do we build castles in the sky.
Oh, tell me why...
all the castles way up high.
