I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day

Ever since I was a tiny boy
I don't want no candy
I don't need no toy
I took a stick and an old coffee can
I bang on that thing til I got
Blisters on my hand because

I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day
Yes, I do
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day
That's right

When I get older they think I'm a fool
The teacher told me I should stay after school
She caught me pounding on the desk with my hands
But my licks was so hot
I made the teacher wanna dance
And that's why

I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day
Hey, why not?
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day

I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day
Listen to this

Every day when I get home from work
I feel so frustrated
The boss is a jerk
And I get my sticks and go out to the shed
And I pound on that drum like it was the boss's head
Because

I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day
I can bang that drum

I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day

I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day
Hey, you wanna take a bang at it?
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day

I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day
I can do this all day
