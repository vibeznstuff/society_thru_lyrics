Red, the fire that burns my heart 
When you're near it wraps me up 
Now I find the space to feel blue 
Like the water it fills me with peace 
When you love me again I still breathe 
King you're at my side 
Your soul in mine 
But I long for your touch 
It's hurting so much 

You give me, give me colored kisses 
Colored kisses for my lips to taste 
You lead me, lead me to an oasis 
An oasis where I can lay 
My head on your shoulder and pray 
What else can I do? 
Cause all I want is more and more 
Colored kisses from you 

Yellow is the sun that shines on me 
Like your smile it sets me free 
Seasons change to blacken my mood 
When I falter my heart goes astray 
I remember the nights when you'd take me away 
Because when I moan your name 
I'm safe and warm but never alone 
Because my heart is your home 

I pray that no one can take me from you 
And no one can break us in two 
So lift us up in clouds 
Set me free and let your bow shine on me 

You give me, give me colored kisses 
Colored kisses for my lips to taste 
You lead me, lead me to an oasis 
An oasis where I can lay 
My head on your shoulder and pray 
What else can I do? 
Cause all I want is more and more 
Colored kisses from you
