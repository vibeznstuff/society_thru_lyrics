Are you breathing 
What I'm breathing 
Are your wishes 
The same as mine 

Are you needing 
What I'm needing 
I'm waiting for a sign 

My hands tremble 
My heart aches 
Is it you calling 
Is it you calling

If I'm alone in this 
I don't think I can face 
The consequences of falling 

Are you thinking 
What I'm thinking 
Does your pulse 
Quicken like mine 

Are you dreaming 
What I'm dreaming 
I can't read your mind 
One step towards you 
Two steps back 
Feels like I'm crawling 
Feels like I'm crawling

If I'm alone in this 
I don't think I can face 
The consequences of falling
