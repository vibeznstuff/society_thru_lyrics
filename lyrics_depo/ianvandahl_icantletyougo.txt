Since you're gone
Everything looks so empty
Without you
Nights are so cold

Can you tell 
Tell me how to convince you
Please come back
I won't let you down

I won't let you down

I can't let you go
Why can't you stay
I still wonder why
I can't let you go
Why can't you stay
Give it one more try
I can't let you go

I can't let you go

And I hope
One day you will forgive me
If I could
I would turn back time

Don't you know
That I'm thinking about you
If you knew
Would you change your mind

Would you change your mind

I can't let you go 
Why can't you stay
I still wonder why
I can't let you go
Why can't you stay
Give it one more try

I can't let you go

I can't let you go
