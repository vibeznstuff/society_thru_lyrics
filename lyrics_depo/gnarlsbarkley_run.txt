Yeah its still the same
Can’t you feel the pain
When the needle hits the vein
Ain’t nothing like the real thing
I’ve seen it once before
And oh it’s something else
Good god

Cool breeze come on in
Sunshine come on down
These are the tear drops of the clown
Circus is coming to town
All I’m saying is sometimes I’m more scared of myself
You better
move
I said
move

Runaway
Runaway
Run children
Run for your life
Runaway
Runaway
Run children
Here it comes
I said run
Alright

Yeah I’m on the run
See where I’m coming from
When you see me coming run
Before you see what I’m running from
No time for question asking time is passing by
Alright

You can’t win child
We’ve all tried to
You’ve been lied to
It’s all ready inside you
Either you run right now
Or you best get ready to die
You better
move
I said
move

Runaway
Runaway
Run children
Run for your life
Runaway
Runaway
Run children
Ooh
Here it comes
I Said run

Hurry little children
Run this way
I have got a beast at bay
La la la la la la la
La la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la l a
La la la la l a
Runaway
runaway
Run children
run for your life
runaway

run children
