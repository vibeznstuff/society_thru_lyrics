My flow drops like an earthquake earthquake, earthquake, earthquake, earthquake, earthquake
I make that ass shake, ass shake, ass shake, ass shake, ass shake, ass shake, ass shake
It's time to deveastate, devastate, deveastate, devastate,deveastate, devastate
I'll make the glass break, glass break, glass break, break, break, break, break
Drop like an earthquake

My flow harder than a bitch fucking good dope
These hoes hating why these hoes so cut throat
One hit wonder bitch, I make that shit pop
He told me to go in, fresh, I pop that shit
My flow shake harder than Alaska quake
The one in 1964, it was devastate
These bitches wonder who I is, tell them shake 'n' bake
Ricky Bobby bitch I'm nobody
Shake that ass on the floor, let me see you wobble it
Tell them to burn my shit when you hit that replay girl, Smokin' while I'm riding
Bitch nigga hiding
Do these shit like every day, drop like an earthquake

Dj Fresh where Diplo at?
Hey Diplo I see you baby (Ugh)

It'll make the ground shake, ground shake, ground shake, ground shake, ground shake, ground shake, grund shake
Play my shit hit the replay, replay, replay, replay, replay, replay, replay
It will never hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, hesitate
It'll make the glass break, glass break, glass break, break, break, break, break
Drop like an earthquake

Drop like an earthquake
