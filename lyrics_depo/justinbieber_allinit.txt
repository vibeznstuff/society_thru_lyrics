Don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Twenty for all of the times,
The times you got back up, whoa
You'd be a billionaire in a year
That's what you gotta think 'til you're there
On the regular.

If you got a diamond for all of your passion,
Diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and
Icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah
Still don't condone it,
Love is a component
You're the only opponent,
Gotta seize the moment

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Gonna give each time
'til the water runs dry
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

All in it, all in it

If I had a guitar missing five strings?
A guitar with only one string, I can only play one song, ooh
A simple melody, simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing, you know what I mean

If you got a diamond for all of your passion,
Diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and
Icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah
Still don't condone it,
Love is a component
You're the only opponent,
Gotta seize the moment

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Gonna give each time
'Til the water runs dry
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

All in it, all in it

See, growing up I—I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
'Cause I, I just didn't think I was good enough
And maybe if I was good at something, that I'd get recognition from that
But I quickly found out that I wasn't going to get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed
Because, because people aren't perfect
And by not being perfect you—you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God, it's like He's perfect and He never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from Him
And give Him recognition
