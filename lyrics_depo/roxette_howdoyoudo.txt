I see you comb your hair
and gimme that grin.
It's making me spin now,
spinnin' within.
Before I melt like snow,
I say Hello
How do you do!

I love the way you undress now.
Baby begin.
Do your caress, honey, my heart's in a mess.
I love your blue-eyed voice,
like Tiny Tim shines thru.
How do you do!
Well, here we are crackin' jokes in the corner of our mouths
and I feellike I'm laughing in a dream.
If I was young I could wait outside your school
cos your face is like the cover of a magazine.

How do you do,
do you do,
the things that you do.
No one I know could ever keep up with you.
How do you do!
Did it ever make sense to you to say Bye
Bye Bye?

I see you in that chair with perfect skin.
Well, how have you been, baby, livin' in sin?
Hey, I gotta know,
did you say Hello
How do you do?
Well, here we are spending time in the louder part of town
and it feels like everything's surreal.
When I get old I will wait outside your house
cos your hands have got the power meant to heal.

How do you do...
