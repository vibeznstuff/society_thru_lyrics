Honey load up your questions
And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend I知 a shelter for heartaches that don稚 have a home
Choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that I値l say is


Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I知 not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

Well, I wish I could say
That I致e never been here before
But you know and I know
That I値l always come back for more
Your love might be my damnation
But I値l cry to my grave
