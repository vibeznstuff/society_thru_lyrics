I bust the windows out your car
And no, it didn't mend my broken heart
I'll probably always have these ugly scars
But right now I don't care about that part

I bust the windows out your car
After I saw you looking right at her
I didn't wanna, but I took my turn
I'm glad I did it, 'cause you had to learn

I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you felt when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you see what happens when

You see you can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You'll probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile

Ha ha ha ha, I bust the windows out your car
You know I did it, cause I left my mark
Wrote my initials with the crowbar
And then I drove off into the a dark

I bust the windows out your car
Hey, you should be lucky that that's all I did
After five whole years of this bullsh**
Gave you all of me, and you played with it

I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you felt when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you see what happens when

You see you can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You'll probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile

Bust windows out your car
But it don't compare to my broken heart
You can never feel how I felt that day
Until that happens, baby you don't know pain, no

You should know it
I ain't sorry, you deserved it
After what you did to me, you deserved it
I ain't sorry, no, no, no

You caused me pain
Even though what you did to me was much worse
I had to do something to make it hurt, yeah

Oh, but why am I still crying?
Why am I the one who is still crying?
Oh, oh, you really hurt me, baby
You really, you really hurt me, babe

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Now watch me, you
Now watch me
I bust the windows out your car
