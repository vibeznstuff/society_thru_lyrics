I don't wanna tell her
No don't want to tell her
I lie awake in the dark
Lost in the beat of my heart
Well baby look over your shoulder 
You're not alone in this love

I don't wanna tell her
No don't want to tell her
That I've been thinking of you
Lost in the things that you do
Maybe its over 
But over is not a word that you know

And if it hurts me baby you know why
I go it alone
Hurt me baby if you like
It's already gone

I don't wanna tell her
No don't want to tell her
I've been calling your name
Each time it feels its in vain
Maybe its over 
But over is not a word that you know

I don't wanna tell her
No don't want to tell her
I've been falling apart
Broke every rule from the start
Baby look over your shoulder 
You're not alone in this love

And if it hurts me baby you know why
I go it alone
Hurt me baby if you like
It's already gone

This is a song 
And these are the words

I don't wanna hear it
Don't wanna hear it

This is a song 
And these are the words

I don't wanna tell her
No don't want to tell her
I lie awake in the dark
Lost in the beat of my heart
Well baby look over your shoulder 
You're not alone in this love
