Ruby, Ruby 
Well I got some food if you're in the mood and the Montrachet's on ice 
Let me satisfy your appetite with some coq au vin on rice 

Oh oh oh Ruby Red - Better use your ruby head 
Oh oh oh Ruby Red - Lying in your ruby bed 

Well I got some food If you're in the mood, oysters aphrodisiac 
And some fine liqueur 100% pure that'll put you on your back 

Oh oh oh Ruby Red - Better use your ruby head 
Oh oh oh Ruby Red - Lying in your ruby bed - Ruby, Ruby 

If you start at the top, you can end up at the bottom 
If you taste there's no waste. All you do is feed your face 
Oh oh oh Ruby Red - I wanna little bit of Ruby - Just a little bit of Ruby 

Oh Ruby Red - Making sure you get well fed 
Oh oh oh Ruby Red - Better use your ruby head 
Oh oh oh Ruby Red - Lying in your ruby bed 
I wanna feel Ruby - I wanna hold Ruby
