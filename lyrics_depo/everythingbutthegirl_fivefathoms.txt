I walked the city late at night 
Just everyone here, do the same
I wanna live the things I see
'cause every face, replace my name

Across the street, take a right
Pick up the pace, pass a fight 
Did I grow up? Did you stay home?
I'm not inmune, I love this tune

I wanna love more, I just wanna love more
I wanna love more, I just wanna love more
I wanna love more, I just wanna love more
I wanna love more, I just wanna love more

I drive the city late at night
It's in my mouth, it's in my head
And the people filled the city
'Cause the city fills the people, oh yeah

Across the street, avoid the freeze
The city's warm by couple of degrees
The smell of food, the smell of rain
I'm not inmune, I love this tune

I wanna love more (there's a river in my head)
I just wanna love you more (there's a river in my head)
I wanna love you more (there's a river in my head)
I just wanna love you more (there's a river in my head)

Only way out is down
Only way up is down

I wanna love more, I just wanna love more
I wanna love more, I just wanna love more
I wanna love more, I just wanna love more
I wanna love more, I just wanna love more
