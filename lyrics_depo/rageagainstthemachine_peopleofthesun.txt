Yeah people come up

Yeah, we better turn tha bass up on this one
Check it, since 1516 minds attacked and overseen
Now crawl amidst the ruins of this empty dream
Wit their borders and boots on top of us
Pullin' knobs on the floor of their toxic metropolis
But how you gonna get what you need ta get?
Tha gut eaters, blood drenched get offensive like Tet
Tha fifth sun sets get back reclaim
Tha spirit of Cuahtemoc alive an untamed
Now face tha funk now blastin' out ya speaker, on tha one Maya, Mexica
That vulture came ta try and steal ya name
But now you got a gun, yeah this is for the people of the sun

It's comin' back around again!
This is for the people of the sun!
It's comin' back around again! Uh!

It's comin' back around again!
This is for the people of the sun!
It's comin' back around again! Uh!

Yeah, neva forget that tha wip snapped ya back
Ya spine cracked for tobacco, oh I'm the Marlboro man, uh
Our past blastin' on through the verses
Brigades of taxi cabs rollin' Broadway like hearses
Troops strippin' zoots, shots of red mist,
Sailors blood on tha deck, come sista resist
From tha era of terror check this photo lens,
Now tha city of angels does the ethnic cleanse
Uh, heads bobbin' to tha funk out ya speaker, on tha one Maya, Mexica
That vulture came to try and steal ya name
But now you found a gun, you're history, this is for the people of the sun

It's comin' back around again!
This is for the people of the sun!
It's comin' back around again! Yeah!

It's comin' back around again!
This is for the people of the sun!
It's comin' back around again!

It's comin' back around again!
This is for the people of the sun!
It's comin' back around again!

It's comin' back around again!
This is for the people of the sun!
It's comin' back around!
Of the sun
