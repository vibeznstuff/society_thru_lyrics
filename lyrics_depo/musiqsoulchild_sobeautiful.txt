You're my baby,
My lover, my lady
All night
You make me
Want you
It drives me crazy
I feel like you were made just for me baby
Tell me if you feel the same way


Cause it just feels so right
I don't wanna waste no time
If I had to choose
I know I'm gonna always choose to be with you
Cause girl don't you know
Girl don't you know
You're so beautiful
I wanna give all my love to you girl
Not just a night
But the rest of your life
I wanna be always here by your side 

When you're not here
You don't know how much I miss you
The whole time on my mind
Is how much I'm gonna get to make
You feel so good
Like you know I could
Tell me if you feel the same way




Baby don't you
Baby don't you know
You're so beautiful (beautiful, beautiful)
Baby don't you know
You're so beautiful
