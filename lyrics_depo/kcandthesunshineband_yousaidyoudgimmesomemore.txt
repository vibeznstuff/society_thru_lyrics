Liar, liar
Telling me a bag of lies
You don't mean a thing you say tonight
You promised me days and days
Now you're gonna go and change your ways
I've seen you 'round somebody else
You must be doin' something else
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
No, no, no, no
Liar, liar, liar
Why you wanna do this to me
I've been so good to you can't you see
I've given everything you want
But seems to make no difference at all
I want your body - I need it now
I need some lovin' - I need it somehow
Baby, you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
