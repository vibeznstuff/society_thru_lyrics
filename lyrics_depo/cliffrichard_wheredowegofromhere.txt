Standing above me
Is someone who wants to love me
Oh oh where do we go from here

Holding my life in your hands
I want to do what you command oh
Oh oh where do we go from here

I'd never thought I'd want you
As much as I do now
I never thought I'd need you
As much as I do now
But I do now

My life was ending
But with you it's just beginning
Oh oh where do we go from here

Oh oh everything seems so clear
Oh oh now that we've come this far
Where do we go from here

I've made my decision
There will be no more division
Oh oh where do we go from here

Oh oh everything seems so clear
Oh oh now that we've come this far
Where do we go from here

I've made my decision
There will be no more division
Oh oh where do we go from here
