I'm a one man woman, that's forever
So open your eyes, we can't stay together
I'd rather say from the start, before we take it too far

I'm a one man woman, I'm a one man woman, I'm a one man woman, oohoo

I'm a one man woman, and you want me to
Be yours for one night, and that's all I am to you
Two's complete, three is a crowd, so I'm not playin' around

I'm a one man woman, I'm a one man woman, I'm a one man woman, oohoo

There's only one, and you don't come near him no way
There's only one, and you'll understand what I mean, someday, hey, hey, hey

I'm free to do as I please, but I know what works best for me

I'm a one man woman,
I'm a one man woman
I'm a one man woman,
I'm a one man woman
I'm a one man woman, 
I'm a one man woman,
I'm a one man woman, oohoo

I want you to know,
I'm a one man woman
