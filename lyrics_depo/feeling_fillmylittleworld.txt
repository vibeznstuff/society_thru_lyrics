I had a dream we went away
Left this city for a day
You took me southwards on a plane
And showed me Spain or somewhere
But in reality you're not so keen to show me anything
And I thought you liked me

Hey, show some love, you aint so tough
Come fill my little world right up, right up
Someday you're going to realise
(I want you)
To fill my little world right up, right up, right up

Yeah, so what you gonna do
With all this stuff piling up, filling up and taking up
You misunderstand me
All I wanted was some evidence
That you really like me
(You really like me)

Hey, show some love, you aint so tough
Come fill my little world right up, right up
Someday you're going to realise
(I want you)
To fill my little world right up, right up, right up

Maybe it's all too much
How come we're so messed up
Maybe I'm not enough
Maybe you're just too much

Hey, show some love, you aint so tough
Come fill my little world right up
Ohh
Ohh
Yeah

Hey, show some love, you aint so tough
Come fill my little world right up, right up
Someday you're going to realise
(I want you)
To fill my little world right up, right up

Hey, show some love, you aint so tough
Come fill my little world right up, right up
Someday you're going to realise
That I'm passing you by
So fill your little world right up, right up, right up

Ohh
Come on and show me you aint so tough
