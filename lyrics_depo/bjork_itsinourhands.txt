Look no further
Look no further
I look no further

Cruelest, almost
Always to ourselves
It mustn't get
Any better, off

It's in our hands
It always was
It's in our hands
In our hands

It's all there
In our hands
It's all there
In our hands

Well, now aren't we
Scaring ourselves
Unnecessarily?
Aren't we trying too hard?

'Cause it's in our hands
It's in our hands
It's all here
It's in our hands

Look no further
I look no further

It's in our hands
It always was
It's in our hands

It's in our hands
It's in our hands
It's in our hands
