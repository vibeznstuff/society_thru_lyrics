Yeah, 8 at 8, Shade 45, streetz is watching
Friday night, Mr. Thanksgiving DJ Drama okay!
I got new music right here
I just want you to remember where you heard it first, with yours truly DJ Drama
This is Elhae
Shout to Kehlani on this
This is a problem!
Mat-matter of fact, I'll just let you find out for yourself
Let's get it
(Hold up!)


It's like one for the money
Two for the show
Three for every nigga out there tryna' reach a goal
Niggas trip me out tryna' hate on the flow
I been doing this since I was in Dakota with the snow, oops
Four for the hoes, can't forget the hoes
The ones that hated on a nigga back when we was po'
Talkin' to my mama like one day we goin' be on
She was working two jobs she was tryna stay strong, yeah
Man I love that girl
But so on and so forth, we did it the right way
A couple bumps on the highway
A couple niggas that be hatin' and they steady talkin' sideways
Back to the zone, care less about the shadow
Cause niggas under me only helped me up the ladder
As much as they be talkin', they probably push me to Saturn
So tell me does it even really matter? (Woo!)

I been through the storm and I know
That they always think that they know
But baby I want you to know that I'mma do me
And just see how it goes
It doesn't really
Matter no no (No it doesn't)
No it doesn't really matter no (No no no no)
It doesn't really matter no (No no no no)
No it doesn't really matter no
Yeah, no it doesn't really matter, no
It doesn't really matter no (No-no-no-no)
No it doesn't really matter no, no


I think I'mma to keep to myself these days
Thinking I'mma focus on my health these days
And I left a bunch of people in last year
Claim they been around for the past year
And I'm asking for receipts like a cashier
And it's niggas falling off like the last tier
Uhh, let me have my moment
Been in the underground, I'm surfaced now
And I just think it's funny how
Everybody in the game asking for service now
Goddamn I got purpose now
Grammy nom under my belt yeah I got purpose now
When I step into my view and I got curtains now
If you ever had a doubt, I know you certain now


I been through the storm and I know
That they always think that they know
Baby I want you to know that I'mma do me
And just see how it goes
It doesn't really
Matter no no
No it doesn't really matter no (No it doesn't really matter no)
It doesn't really matter no (No it doesn't really matter no)
No it doesn't really matter no (No)
Yeah, no it doesn't really matter no
(No it doesn't really matter no)
It doesn't really matter no
No it doesn't really matter no, no


Woo!
It doesn't really
No no no no no no no no
Yeah, no it doesn't really matter no
No it doesn't really matter, no
It doesn't really matter, no
Don't walk away, yeah yeah, no no
