I'm the driver
Bringing this circus to town
First one in and the last rolling out
Shutting down
The up all nighter
All the stars and sunrises I've seen
Every cornfield and town in between
West to east

Oh, easy come easy go
Yeah we rocked then we rolled outta town
But for now, while the moment is here
Shine a light, drink a beer, let's get loud
All the drivers and dreamers, believers and singers
Oh, won't you sing with me now
Oh-o-oh, oh-o-o-oh-oh

I'm a dreamer
Soaking up every line
Searching for truth all the time
Oh yeah
The believer
That music can save a soul
The one whose at every show
In the front row singing

Oh, easy come easy go
Yeah we rocked then we rolled outta town
But for now, while the moment is here
Shine a light, drink a beer, let's get loud
All the drivers and dreamers, believers and singers
Oh, won't you sing with me now
Oh-o-oh, oh-o-o-oh-oh

I'm a singer
Pouring out all that I have
Every love song and heartbreak gone bad
And looking back
When I was younger
Sitting right there where you are
Sending a prayer to the highest star
And here we are
Oh, here we are

Oh, easy come easy go
Yeah we rocked then we rolled outta town
But for now, while the moment is here
Shine a light, drink a beer, let's get loud
All the drivers and dreamers, believers and singers
Oh, won't you sing with me now
Oh-o-oh, oh-o-o-oh
Oh-o-oh, oh-o-o-oh
