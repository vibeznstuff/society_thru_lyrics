Step up here to me, 
Am I dumb enough to believe. 
When somebody says jump on this, 
Would you follow them on your knees. 
Am I wrong or right, 
To be dancing with you tonight? 
Said I'm done with his fantasies, 
What I got is my sanity 

My baby knows what I want, 
He's getting my in my thing. 
He better takes what I got, 
Or he won't see me again. 
Cause there's been too many guys, 
Just making moves on the floor. 
My baby is reading my mind, 
He knows that I'm needing more. 

I left my heart in Tokyo, 
Down by the river don't you know. 
I had to let it go, 
Nobody know know knows 

That 
I left my heart in Tokyo, 
Down by the river don't you know. 
I had to let it go, 
Nobody knows, can bring it home 

Seventeen and dumb, 
Look at me, I know right from wrong. 
You and my, we got something on, 
And I dont need to hear that come come. 
Seventeen and dumb, 
Look at me, I know right from wrong. 
You and my, we got something on, 
And I dont need to hear that come come. 

Make your mind with the diamonds in the right sack. 
Give it time and im gonna get you right back. 
So the signs and I never ever write back. 
I keep it tight cause I know you really like that. 
Do it right and you know I'm gonna hype it. 
All the rhymes and I'll stick until you write back. 

I left my heart in Tokyo, 
Down by the river don't you know. 
I had to let it go, 
Nobody know know knows 

That 
I left my heart in Tokyo, 
Down by the river don't you know. 
I had to let it go, 
Nobody knows, can bring it home 

I left my heart in Tokyo, 
Down by the river don't you know. 
I had to let it go, 
Nobody know know knows 

That 
I left my heart in Tokyo, 
Down by the river don't you know. 
I had to let it go, 
Nobody knows, can bring it home 

Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick so tired of the best dress 
Didn't really want to keep it for the rest, ah ah ooh. 
So I skipped to the next best, 
Did'nt really know that I was gonna end up here, 

I left my heart in Tokyo, 
Down by the river don't you know. 
I had to let it go, 
Nobody know know knows 

That 
I left my heart in Tokyo, 
Down by the river don't you know. 
I had to let it go, 
Nobody knows, can bring it home 

Nobody knows, can bring it home 

Nobody knows, can bring it home...
