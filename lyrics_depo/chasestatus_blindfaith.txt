Sweet sensation

I am a man with a heavy heart
And I dare not turn the pages
Fighting with automatic self destruction
It's a blind faith
A cruel waste
One bitter taste
So I know I need this sweet sensation

Sweet sensation
The music that we play
Will ease your mind
Sweet sensation
The music that we play
Will ease your mind

What is a man now to do with his mind
When it's working overtime
The best I can do is now dance with the devil
I keep my soul sane
I won't waste
This time and space
So I know I need this sweet sensation

Sweet sensation
The music that we play
Will ease your mind
Sweet sensation
The music that we play
Will ease your mind

I am a man with a heavy heart
I am a man with a heavy heart
It's a blind faith
A cruel waste
One bitter taste
So I know I need this sweet sensation

Sweet sensation (will ease your mind)
The music that we play (the music)
Will ease your mind
Sweet sensation (will ease your mind)
The music that we play (the music)
Will ease your mind

I am a man with a heavy heart
I am a man with a heavy heart
It's a blind faith
A cruel waste
One bitter taste
So I know I need this sweet sensation
