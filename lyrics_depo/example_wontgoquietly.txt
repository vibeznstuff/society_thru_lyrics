I needed more than just a kiss goodnight
Had to go get something out my system I
Ignored the warnings, bit the fruit
She might have tasted good
But man she was my kryptonite

Shoulda known she was trouble from the start
I, knew she'd broken hearts I,
Thought I'd take that chance
Danced with the she devil in the pale moonlight
Alarm bells rang, but I loved the drama
In a dark place but I loved the karma sutra
Shoulda closed that door
But I kept going back for more

She's electric, she's the current running through my veins
She's a siren, hearing voices that I can't explain
Now I should be thinking it over
Instead I'm calling her over
Now she's here and she won't go quietly
I Should be thinking it over
Instead I'm calling her over
Now she's here but she won't go quietly

I needed more than just a cheap thrill ride
See I needed something that ran deep inside
Ignored the warnings, bit the fruit
She might have tasted good
But man she was my kryptonite

Shoulda known it wouldn't last for a year I,
Knew it'd all end it tears I,
Cracked, she was mind addictive, never felt scripted
Upredicatable, tied up, but no strings attatched
Left scratch marks on my back
Her cold eyes got me excited and I can't hide the truth

She's electric, she's the current running through my veins
(I just can't kick the habit )
She's a siren, hearing voices that I can't explain
(I just can't kick the habit)
Now I should be thinking it over
Instead I'm calling her over
Now she's here and she won't go quietly
I should be thinking it over
Instead I'm calling her over
Now she's here and she won't go quietly

Can't see the end of this or who survives
It's just another case of do or die
Can't see the end of this or who survives
It's just another case, another case, another case
Another case, another case...

She's electric, she's the current running through my veins
(I just can't kick the habit )
She's a siren, hearing voices that I can't explain
(I just can't kick the habit)
Now I, should be thinking it over
Instead I'm calling her over
Now she's here and she won't go quietly
I should be thinking it over
Instead I'm calling her over
Now she's here and she won't go quietly

Can't see the end of this or who survives
It's just another case of do or die
Can't see the end of this or who survives
It's just another case of do or die
Can't see the end of this or who survives
It's just another case of do or die
