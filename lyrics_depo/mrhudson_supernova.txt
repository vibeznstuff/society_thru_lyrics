And I feel like takin off
Let me be your supernova
Before u make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me the chance to get it right, get it right


They got it all
They've got all the things I thought I wanted
But I can't afford
To fake anymore
To live this fasad
Of smiles as the warm champagne pours
Out on the lawn we pretend we are haven tons of fun
In this world where we don't belong
So don't come around
Is she thinking of me, did she forget
What we once had

And I feel like takin off
Let me be your supernova
Before u make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me the chance to get it right, get it right


Oooh they got it all
You can see they got it all
They got the cars the boat
And the beautiful house by the shore
... you know there's more
But I can't take another minute of it all
He wants his kids and his dog
He wants his breakfast in bed
Hes got his trust funds saved
Not a worry in his head
But it's not you homey
I wanna break up this scene
And see you runnin back to me

Cause I feel like taken off
Let me be your supernova tonight
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me a chance to get it right, get it right

Ya I feel like taken off
Let me be your supernova tonight
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me a chance to get it right, get it right

You got it wrong
If you say our love is gone 

Ya I feel like taken off
Let me be your supernova
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me a chance to get it right, get it right
