It's all over
And it's only beginning
We're beginning to finally see one another
We grow stronger
We grow stronger for breaking
We grow stronger for breaking apart together

Lover, find me underneath the covers
We will stay here until we discover
All that we have to give to each other
Til forever

How you move me
How you move me to love you
I keep choosing to love you again every morning

Lover, find me underneath the covers
We will stay here until we discover
All that we have to give to each other
Til forever

Take this body, I give it all for you
Hold me, touch me, when you make your move

Let me lay here beside you
We can stay here and not say a word

Lover, find me underneath the covers
We will stay here until we discover
All that we have to give to each other
Til forever
Til forever
