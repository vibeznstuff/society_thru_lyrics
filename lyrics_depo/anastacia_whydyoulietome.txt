Why did you lie to me?
Can't be trusted, good for nothing type of brother
Everything you claimed to be was a lie, lie
Why did you lie to me?
You've been creepin', sneekin', sleepin' with another
Messed up, it's time to leave, so bye, bye

Used to treat me like a queen
Said I was your everything
Promised me that you would never cheat, on me
But I found a number on the floor
And I won't take it no more
Baby it feels so crazy thinkin' you'd be true to me, yeah
