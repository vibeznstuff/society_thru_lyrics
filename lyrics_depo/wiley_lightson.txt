Even though you don't know
Even though you don't know
Even though you don't know my name
Me and you bleed exactly the same
I smile and come across I'll tame
A hundred volts take your life ain't a game
I switch them lights off, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, DJ turn them lights off, yeah


She got a light switched on
My lights switched on
She looking in my eyes like I like this don
I wanna know what side she's from
I see many girls but I like this one
Told me she was a west side lady
Had a few friends but they were all shady
Now she on the solo ting
So nobody can't send her crazy
Too many friends and not enough true friends
Made her wanna go and move to a new ends
I care though, 'cause even if my life gets lonely
It's all good, to keep few friends


We connected I asked her out and then she accepted
I think she gets it
When the end of the night comes
Me and her leave for the exit


Even though you don't know my name
Me and you bleed exactly the same
I smile and come across I'll tame
A hundred volts take your life ain't a game
I switch them lights off (When the end of the night comes)
Yeah, oh, DJ turn them lights off (I like this one)
Yeah


Everywhere we go we about to have fun
Take care of me we're gettin' the job done
She keeps my mind calm getting a lot done
I know it's all new but it feels so long
On first sight I wanted to be acquainted
People gonna see us out think that we're dating
And we don't know where we even wanna take it
But we got a good bond and I don't wanna break it


We connected I asked her out and then she accepted
I think she gets it
When the end of the night comes
Me and her leave for the exit


Even though you don't know my name
Me and you bleed exactly the same
I smile and come across I'll tame
A hundred volts take your life ain't a game
I switch them lights off (When the end of the night comes)
Yeah, oh, DJ turn them lights off (I like this one)
Yeah


DJ hit up the switch already
Turn the lights on, Beyonce
We're not quite there but I must say
I like the dimples on that face
Yeah, I like them tats on her rib cage
On, that sexy dress the only part that's revealing yes
That's why I'm respecting her
Rejecting them and selecting her strength


Anywhere we go we're bound to have fun
You take care of me, we're getting the job done

I switch them lights off, yeah, yeah,
Oh, DJ turn them lights off, yeah, yeah,

When the end of the night comes
Me and her leave for the exit
