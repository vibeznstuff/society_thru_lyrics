Oooh, yeah

It was right
Even though it felt wrong
Nothin' ever stopped you
From showin' your progression suddenly


Broken lies
Drivin' backwards
Makin' all the wrong turns
Sayin' all the wrong words
Dodgin' angels


Oh, let's not be alone
Let's not be alone
Let's be one
Oh, let's not be alone
Empty thoughts fill the room
Breathe for me and I'll breathe for you

Let's be selfish, selfish, baby
Tonight
Tonight
Let's be selfish, selfish, baby
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, yeah, yeah


I just hit the liquor side of France
Currency exchange, lookin' fancy
If that money dirty, make it dance
25 karats cost a mansion
Gold rose petals, bottle standin'
Came from the concrete, takin' chances
Pop gold Ace like a Xanny
I just need the blessin' from your family
Broken lies, ain't no love without us
It will die, roses turn into dust
Every night, we gettin' more popular
Wrong is right, when it comes to us


Oh, let's not be alone
Let's not be alone
Tonight, let's be selfish
Selfish, tonight, tonight
Let's be selfish, selfish, baby
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, yeah, yeah


I'll be selfish
Let's be selfish
Ohh, ohh
(Yeah, yeah)
Ooooh, oooo-oooo-oooh
I'll be selfish
Let's be selfish
Let's be
Let's be selfish
(Yeah, yeah)
