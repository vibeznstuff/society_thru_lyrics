Oohh… Shit

How you wanna feel
Do you wanna it raw
Do you want it real
Ima give it to ya
Ima give it to ya real honest
Yeah…
You ain’t never had it like this before

Roll in my sheets while we rolling paper
Trying to get you higher than them skrapers
Catching vibes, catching vapors
You should call in sick
You should call in favors

I promise…
You ain’t never had it like this before

So don’t you lie
Don’t you tell me that you gotta go to work baby
Cause I can pay you for the whole week in bed
I just wanna get lost with you
That mean you belong to me
I wanna wake up

Waking up to you in the morning
It’s better than sunrise
So we can keep the curtains closed
Just light a few more candles and burn em’ slow

Baking up with you in the morning
Trying to get a little rewind
Cause I ain’t really ready to let you go
No no no no no  No no no
Just light a few more candles and burn em’ slow

Oohh… Shit

Girl that Honey Jack put us on our back
When we on our back we get back to that action
Pour up Pour up

And  let us take another round down
So we can get in another round .. Yeah
I don’t need no breakfast ‘less it’s you on my face

Then we wake and we bake

Waking up to you in the morning
It’s better than sunrise
So we can keep the curtains closed
Just light a few more candles and burn em’ slow

Baking up with you in the morning
Trying to get a little rewind
Cause I ain’t really ready to let you go
No no no no no  No no no
Just light a few more candles and burn em’ slow

Cause I ain’t really ready to let you go
No no no no no

Then we wake and we bake

Waking up to you in the morning
So we can keep the curtains closed
Keep em’ closed

Let’s burn baby

Baking up with you in the morning
Rewind Rewind
I just wanna get lost with you
No no no no no  No no no
Just light a few more candles and burn em’ slow

Ooh Shit
