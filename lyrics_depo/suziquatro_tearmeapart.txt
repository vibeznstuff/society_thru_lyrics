Way down in Texas, down around San Antone
Stay's a little lovely
Sweeter than you've ever known
Don't let me hear that sweet kid's name
Get your hands on me and I'll drive you insane

So tear me apart if you want to win my heart
Tear me apart if you want to win my heart

Well I've been seen in the back of a limousine
I may not own it, but it's bigger than you've ever seen
She'll ride around and think she's a star
If you squeeze, she's a tease, you won't get far

So tear me apart if you want to win my heart
Tear me apart if you want to win my heart

Oh your legs start shaking every time they hear my name
There'll be no heart breaking and you know you'll never be the same
Don't talk to me about Louisiana Sue
'Cos she can't do the things that I can do

So tear me apart if you want to win my heart

I'm going to say goodbye to the likes of San Antone
I'm Hollywood bound and there I'm gonna make my home
Now I don't give a damn what they think they've seen
'Cos they ain't seen nothing like a Texas queen

So tear me apart if you want to win my heart
Tear me apart if you want to win my heart
Tear me apart if you want to win my heart
Tear me apart if you want to win my heart
Tear me apart if you want to win my heart
Tear me apart if you want to win my heart
Tear me apart if you want to win my heart
Tear me apart if you want to win my heart
Tear me apart if you want to win my
Tear me apart if you want to win my
Tear me apart if you want to win my heart
