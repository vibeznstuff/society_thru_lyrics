Dance with me, pretty boy tonight
Dance with me, and we'll be alright
There's a whole floor before us, just for you and me,
So follow my lead, and we'll 1-2-3

Pull Shapes,
I like to Disco
I like to Rock n' Roll
Well I like to Hip-Hop
We can do it all, just don't let the music stop

Pull Shapes,
I lead with my left hand
I stomp with my right foot
Well I just wanna freak out
I just wanna move, I don't care what the song's about

Dance with me, pretty boy tonight
Dance with me, and we'll be alright
There's a whole floor before us, just for you and me,
So follow my lead, and we'll 1-2-3

Pull Shapes,
Is there a drumbeat?
Pull Shapes
And is the bass beat?
Pull Shapes
Then the rhythm is complete

Well get up on the floor, its time for you to move your feet

Dance with me, pretty boy tonight
Dance with me, and we'll be alright
There's a whole floor before us, just for you and me,
So follow my lead, and we'll 1-2-3

What do you do when the music stops?
What do you do when the music stops?
What do you do when the music stops?
What do you do when the music stops?

Pull Shapes
Clap your hands if you want some more,
Pull Shapes
Clap your hands if you want some more,
Pull Shapes
Clap your hands if you want some more,
Pull Shapes
Clap your hands if you want some more,

Clap your hands if you want some more,
Clap your hands if you want some more,

Dance with me, pretty boy tonight
Dance with me, and we'll be alright
There's a whole floor before us, just for you and me,
So follow my lead, and we'll 1-2-3
