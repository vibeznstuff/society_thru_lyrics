I've a dream, silver dream machine.
Here am I, I'm going for another try,
Flying high, I've got a lot of love inside.
Is there love enough now to get me through?
Yeah, I know now where I'm going to -
Not to lose now but to win;
Tell me, how do I begin?
I've a dream, silver dream machine.
Well, alright, I've got a lot of love to try,
'Cause love is the thing,
And freedom is the word I sing.
Is there force now, yeah, to get us through?
Yeah, it's deep in me and it's deep in you -
Not to lose now but to win,
Tell me how do I begin?
I've a dream, silver dream machine;
Silver dream, silver dream machine.

Is there love enough now to get me through?
Yeah, I know now where I'm going to -
Not to lose now but to win;
Tell me how do I begin?
I've a dream, silver dream machine;
Silver dream, silver dream machine;
Silver dream, silver dream machine.
