I think I'm in love,
With the girl next door
It's driving me crazy
I can't take it any more
I hear her playing the drums late at night
The neighbours complain but that's the kind of girl I like

And maybe I should call her up
And buy her a round
Maybe I should move to another town
But when I hear those drums late at night
I know I'm in love
With a girl who lives
Two doors down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two doors down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two doors down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two doors down
I think I'm in love

She and her friends sit at the back of the bus
But I'm always to shy to work the courage up
I hear that she likes to dance around the room
To a worn out 12" of Marquee Moon

And maybe I should say "What's up?"
And buy her a round
Or take her for a spin around the town
Cos when I hear those drums late at night
I know I'm in love
With a girl who lives
Two doors down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two doors down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two doors down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two doors down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two doors down
I think I'm in love
Two doors down
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two doors down
I think I'm in love
Two doors down
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two doors down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives

And maybe I should call her up
And buy her a round
And one day we could move to another town
Cos when I hear those drums late at night
I know I'm in love
In love with a girl who lives
Two doors down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two doors down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two doors down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two doors down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two doors down
I think I'm in love
Two doors down
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two doors down
I think I'm in love
Two doors down
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two doors down

I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
