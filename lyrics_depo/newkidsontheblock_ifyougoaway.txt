Girl, I just can't live without you 
I know I hurt you 
That's the last thing I meant to do 
Sometimes I can be careless and blind 
Can you forgive the fool that I've been? 

You know I love you 
You're the one thing I have that's true 
My life used to be nothing to me 
I never want to feel that again 


If you go away girl 
You're taking my heart with you 
If you go away girl 
You'll be breaking my heart in two 
If you only stay girl 
I promise you the world 
So please don't ever go away 

You know I need you 
I'm so sorry that I made you cry 
You are everything good in my life 
Your tears have finally opened my eyes 


I was so wrong to ever look at another baby 
Even the strongest man can stumble and fall 
And I'll do anything for you 
Anything to be in your arms again 
Baby don't let this be the end 


Girl, I just can't live without you 

Never, ever leave me girl 
You promised your love to me forever 
Say you'll never leave me girl
