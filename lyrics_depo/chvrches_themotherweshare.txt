Never took your side, never cursed your name
I keep my lips shut tight, until you go-o-oh
We've come as far as we're ever gonna get
Until you realize, that you should go-o-oh

I'm in misery where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share will never keep our cold hearts from calling

In the dead of night, I'm the only one here
And I will cover you, until you go-o-oh
'Cause if I told the truth, I will always be free
And keep a prize with me, until you go-o-oh

I'm in misery where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share will never keep our cold hearts from calling

Into the night for once, we're the only ones left
I bet you even know, where we could go-o-oh
And when it all fucks up, you put your head in my hands
It's a souvenir for when you go-o-oh

I'm in misery where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share will never keep our cold hearts from calling
