You're taking the fun
Out of everything
Making me run
When I don't want to think
You're taking the fun
Out of everything
I don't want to think at all


There's no other way
There's no other way
All that you can do
Is watch them play

You're taking the fun
Out of everything
You're making it clear
When I don't want to think
You're taking me up
When I don't want to go up anymore
I'm just watching it all
