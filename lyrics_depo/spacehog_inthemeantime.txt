And in the end, we shall achieve in time
The thing they call divine
And all the stars will smile for me
When all is well and well is all for all
And forever after
Maybe in the meantime, wait and see, yeah

We love the all the all of you
Where lands are green and skies are blue
When all in all, we're just like you
We love the all of you

And when I cry for me, I cry for you
With tears of holy joy
For all the days of still to come
And did I ever say I'd never play
Or fly toward the sun?
Maybe in the meantime, something's sung

We love the all the all of you
Where lands are green and skies are blue
When all in all, we're just like you
We love the all of you

That sounds fine, so I'll see you sometime
Give my love to the future of a-humankind
Okay, okay, it's not okay
Ooh, while it's on my mind
There's a girl that fits the crime for a future love dream
That I'm still to find
But in the meantime

We love the all the all of you
Where lands are green and skies are blue
When all in all, we're just like you
We love the all of you

We love the all the all of you
Where lands are green and skies are blue
When all in all, we're just like you
We love the all of you, yeah

Love the all the all of you
Lands are green and skies are blue

Just like you
We're just like you
We're just like, we're just like
Just like you
Just like you
We're just like you
We're just like, just like
Just like you
