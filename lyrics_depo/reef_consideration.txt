I don't think that kindness is a weakness.
I don't have a problem with compassion
Tell me what you're thinking?
Would you like to be so high?
Could you give consideration to something
That you did not release?
Would you close your ears to
The things you did not believe?

Tell me would you be strong?
Would you be the one to carry on? 

Half don't come here 
So do I.
It's gonna be alright...
