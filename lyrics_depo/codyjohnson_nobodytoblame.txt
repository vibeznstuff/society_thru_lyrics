If I hadn't of stayed gone
You'd have never be alone
But then I wouldn't be on this road that I'm on
If I'd have chose not to sing
Hell I could have done a lotta things

But then this feeling inside wouldn't be the same
And I coulda been everything
That they say I shoulda been
I shoulda loved you
Like our love would never end
I could hoped but I didn't
So this is the life I'm livin'
Six strings one drink
And nobody to blame but me

A voice from all the crowds pick me up
When I am down that's something
Even when your not around
All the whiskey and late nights
Lets you know that I was just something
That you had to lay down

I coulda been everything
That they say I coulda been
I shoulda loved you
Like our love would never end
I coulda hoped but I didn't
So this is the life I'm livin'
Six strings one drink
And nobody to blame but me

Ooh here tonight I see
With the spot light on me
I've got everything that I need
With six strings one drink
And one to blame but me

Six strings one drink
And nobody to blame but me
