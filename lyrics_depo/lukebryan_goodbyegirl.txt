Yeah, I know that color on your lips too well
I saw you blowing kisses down the wishing well again
When I say I love you, you just say "I know"
You put your arms around me, but it's all for show
And then, there you go wrecking my whole world
All fixed up, my goodbye girl

You scatter in the wind just like a dandelion
Reminding me again that you ain't ever mine for long
But I know it's gonna happen when the moon is right
You'll show up at my door and pull me in just like a song
There you go, wrecking my whole world
One more hello, one more goodbye, girl

It might seem crazy to keep loving you this way
But I'll never bring myself to say goodbye, girl

The sun is gonna make it's way around again
but the rain is always waiting just around the bend
And there you go, wrecking my whole world
One more hello, one more goodbye, girl
All fixed up, my goodbye girl
Goodbye girl
Goodbye girl
