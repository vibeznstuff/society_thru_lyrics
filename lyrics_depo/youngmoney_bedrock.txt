I Can make your bed rock (Young Money)
I Can make your bed rock girl
Kane is in the building nigga
I Can make your bed rock
I Can make your bed rock


She got that good good, she Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her for her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go, but I'd love to watch her leave
But I keep her runnin' back and forth like a soccer team
Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
 Young Money thieves, steal your love and leave
 Young Money thieves, steal your heart with ease


I like the way you walkin' if you walkin' my way
I'm that red bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place with all kinds of space
I'll let you be the judge and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda, I put her under
I see me with her, no Stevie Wonder
She don't even wonder, cause she know she bad
And I got her nigga, grocery bags


Okay, oh baby
I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the g-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock girl
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock


Okay, I get it, let me think, I guess it's my turn
Maybe it's time to put this pussy on your side burns
He say I'm bad, he probably right
He pressin' me like button downs on a Friday night (Ha ha ha)
I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike
Be on my low scorch
Be on my echo whites
He say, "Nicki don't stop, you the bestest."
And I just be coming off the top as bestest


I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi
I race for your love, shake and bake, Ricky bobby
I'm at the W but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl I gotta watch my back cause I'm not just anybody
I see them standing in line, just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston, I let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh that was your girl, I thought I recognized her


Okay, oh baby
I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the g-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock girl
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock


She like tannin', I like stayin' in
She like romancin', I like rollin' with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscious is
She watchin' that oxygen, I'm watchin' ESPN
But when that show ends, she all on my skin lotion
Slow motions, roller coasting like back, forth, hold it (Hold it )
She pose like it's for posters and I poke like I'm supposed to
Take this photo if you for me, she said don't you ever show this
I'm too loyal and too focused, to be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it
Said your words get me open, so I closed it
Where your clothes is, I'm only loving for the moment


She ain't got a man but she's not alone
Miss independent yeah she got her own
Hey gorgeous, umm, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it, this how I call it
Yeah, look at how she walk, mmhmm she know she bad
Do your thang baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain't leaving fast, Imma stay a while
Hold your head Chris, Imma take her down


Okay, ooh baby
I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the g-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock girl
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock
