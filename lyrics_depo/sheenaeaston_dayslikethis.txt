Momma said love will come easy
Falling in love won't be hard
So don't be mislead by your feelings
Cause some will just play with your heart

Wouldn't you know she was right for the 99th time
She knew just what was in sight
Cause I fell in love with a man
Who doesn't even care
Her words are what kept me alive


There will be days like this
There will be nights when you just can't go on
There will be seconds of minutes
Minutes of hours
That's when you've got to be strong
Hold on, hold on

Daddy said love was a mystery
Said there are no rules for the heart
It's been that way throughout history
Together today then apart

Wouldn't you know he was right for the 99th time
He knew just what was in sight
Cause I gave my heart to a man
Who treats me so bad
His words are so fresh in my mind



Hold on because good love
Is so hard to find
If you find a special love
You know it's right
Hold on because sweet love
Lengthens your life
You'll find your sweet love in time
Hold on

Hold on
