I can see a hurricane tonight, 
It keeps from my valentine, 
This voodoo's doing me harm, 
Ooh, ooh, raise the alarm, 
Maybe, this is the moment to pray dear, 
But I'd rather lay by your side, 
Cos' millions are fighting their way here
Oh, oh, oh, tell me, 
When did the water surround me? 
But tell me, is that love in your eyes?
New Orleans'll tremble tonight, 
With bleeding hearts and swaying lights, 
A very modern machine, 
wooh, wooh, is coming for me, 
Maybe, this is the moment to say dear, 
I thought I'd have you by now, 
But sentiment got in the way dear, 
Oh, oh, oh, tell me, 
When did the water surround me? 
But tell me, is that love in your eyes? 
Oh, oh, oh, tell me, 
When did the water surround me? 
But tell me, is that, is that love...

Tell me, 
When did the water surround me? 
But tell me, is that love in your eyes? 
Oh, oh, oh, tell me, 
When did the water surround me? 
And tell me, is that, is that love? 
Just tell me the truth it makes me feel better, 
Love in your eyes, it makes me feel better.

Tell me the truth it makes me feel better, 
Love in your eyes, it makes me feel better.
