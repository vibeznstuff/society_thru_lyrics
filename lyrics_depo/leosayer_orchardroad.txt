To tell the truth it's really such a sad affair
Standing here waiting in the cold night air
But I've got to make this call
'Cos my heart is breaking
I hear the pips drop a coin in the slot
Has it been that long
I thought you'd forgotten me
Well I know that it's getting late
But I just couldn't wait
Will I have the nerve to say
I just wanna come back
You shouldn't just go away
I just wanna come back
I've been struck by such a bad luck
I need a place a little happiness and some love
I think I can see it now
Now let me paint the picture
It's twelve o' clock and the curtains are drawn
They're counting sheep down in Orchard Road
You're hanging on the telephone line tonight
And I wish I could be
In Orchard Road
Not much been happening here
I think I've got a job
They're gonna call me next week
And I'll be working out of town
Well it sure beats hanging around
What's that
Tomorrow at two
You're kidding me, no
Is it alright with you
I don't know what to say
It'll be like a holiday
When you say you're all alone
Makes me wanna come back
And this house is not a home
I just gotta go back
It's twelve ten when I put down the phone
The moon's shining down on Orchard Road
And I'm feeling like a schoolboy again and tonight
I'll see you in my dreams of Orchard Road



It's funny but I thought I'd never go back
I think sometimes I might lose track
But I remember you and the things we do
And I want it back
In Orchard Road you've got my heart
I left it in your doorway
In Orchard Road a welcome mat
Is waiting there just for me
In Orchard Road
The sun will shine again, I know, I know
In Orchard Road you keep my love
It's waiting there for me
It's eight o'clock and the dawn's arrived
In Orchard Road it's breakfast time
I climb in my car and I turn the key and I'm gone
I am coming home
To Orchard Road
I'm coming home
