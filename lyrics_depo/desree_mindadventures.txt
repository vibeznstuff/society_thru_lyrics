Many lifetimes have I seen, all are vivid in my dreams
Different stories, different themes, mind adventures

Many mountains have I climbed to kiss the sky of sweet July
Exotic birds go flying by, mind adventures

Would you like an invitation to my destination, babe
It ain't hard, it's easy to find

I won't beg or buy, I'll borrow love, hey, what are you thinking of
Adventures take place in my mind

Many stories I've been told by wise men young and some are old
They were strong and they were bold, mind adventures

Many seasons have I seen, unconventional indeed
In places they have never seen spring or summer

Would you like an invitation to my destination, babe
It ain't hard, it's easy to find

I won't beg or buy, I'll borrow love, hey, what are you thinking of
Adventures take place in my mind

Futuristic I may be, I don't feel differently
About strange things I hear and see, mind adventures

You may have eyes you may not see, you may possess dry chemistry
These mean nothing much to me, mind adventures

Would you like an invitation to my destination, babe
It ain't hard, it's easy to find

I won't beg or buy, I'll borrow love, hey, what are you thinking of
Adventures take place in my mind

Would you like an invitation to my destination, babe
It ain't hard, it's easy to find

I won't beg or buy, I'll borrow love, hey, what are you thinking of
Adventures take place in my mind

Mind adventures they will set you free, it's easy as you'll see, yes

Mind adventures they will set you free, it's easy as you'll see
