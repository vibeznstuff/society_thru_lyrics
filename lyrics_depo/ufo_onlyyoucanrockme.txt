Who's taking time out, we'll take a shine out
We're the boys we got nothing to lose
I've had enough now of school and stuff now
If you ain't with us then it's just bad news

Only you can rock me rock me
Come on back now d o it again
Only you can rock me, rock me
Kicking out just like a hurricane

We can't wait from day to day
Cuz we've got something to say
we can't wait from day to day
Cuz we've got something to say

Come on the street now on every corner
breaking out and we're doing what we want to
Just like a jewel shines in the night
she burns so hot out under the street light



We are here and there's no end
we keep on coming again
we are here and there's no end
we just keep coming again



Who's taking time out, we take a shine out
We're the boys we got nothing to lose
I've had enough now of school

and stuff now
If you ain't with us then it's just bad news

Only you can rock me, rock me
Come on back now, do it again
Only you can rock me, rock me
Kickin' out just like a hurricane

We can't wait from day to day
Cuz we've got something to say
We are here and there's no end
We'll keep on coming again

We can't wait from day to day
Cuz we've got something to say
We are here and there's no end
We'll keep on coming again
