Listen to me

You know how much you want him
You're tryin' to be cool about it, you're tryin' to be big about it
You're constantly just denying
You're like a moth to a flame, you hardly wait

But listen girls, I know what I'm saying
He's tryin' to catch you in it and then he will back you in it
'Cause he's just another girl addict
And if you give it away, you gotta be crazy, crazy

Stop, you better shake him off before he gets ya
He's comin' to get ya, he's comin' to get ya
Stop, he'll only build you up and then forget ya
He's dirty to the bone, beware of the dog

Well, I was damn near addicted
I got into trouble with him, I got in a bubble with him
Where everything was just how he wanted
Oh, but then I got wise, I got outta sight, so take my advice

Stop, you better shake him off before he gets ya
He's comin' to get ya, he's comin' to get ya
Stop, he'll only build you up and then forget ya
He's dirty to the bone, beware of the dog

Stop, you better shake him off before he gets ya
He's comin' to get ya, he's comin' to get ya
Stop, he'll only build you up and then forget ya
He's dirty to the bone, beware of the dog

I know you hear me
I know you hear me, I know you hear me
You better reach out and touch me
You better reach out

Stop, you better shake him off before he gets ya
He's comin' to get ya, he's comin' to get ya
Stop, he'll only build you up and then forget ya
He's dirty to the bone, beware of the dog

Stop, you better shake him off before he gets ya
He's comin' to get ya, he's comin' to get ya
Stop, he'll only build you up and then forget ya
He's dirty to the bone, beware of the dog

Stop, you better shake him off before he gets ya
He's comin' to get ya, he's comin' to get ya
Stop, he'll only build you up and then forget ya
He's dirty to the bone, beware of the dog

Beware of the dog, beware of the dog
Beware of the dog, beware of the dog
