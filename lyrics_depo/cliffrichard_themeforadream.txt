You are my theme for a dream
Yes you are, a rare and lovely theme (You're a theme for a dream)
The dreams I dream day and night
That your arms are holding me so tight (You're a theme for a dream)

When I dream I kiss you (kiss you)
Music fills with starlight (starlight)
Every time I touch you (when I touch you)
Each and every time a chime rings out I love you
Only you forever more

'Cause you're my theme for a dream
Yes you are a rare and lovely theme (You're my theme for a dream)
So, angel please say that you love me too
And make my dreams come true (you're my theme for a dream)

When I dream I kiss you (kiss you)
Music fills with starlight (starlight)
Every time I touch you (when I touch you)
Each and every time a chime rings out I love you
Only you for ever more

'Cause you're my theme for a dream
Yes you are a rare and lovely theme (You're my theme for a dream)
So, angel please say that you love me too
And make my dreams come true

And make my dreams come true
Please make my dreams come true.
