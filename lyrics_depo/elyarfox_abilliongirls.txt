I heard Rihanna wants your body
With curves like the streets of Monaco
And everybody says you are trouble
But I don't wanna know, no
I don't wanna know

I've try, try tried but they don't measure up
While all this time, time, time
You're spilling over the cup
And maybe I
And maybe I
Should listen to my head
But my heart says, says, says

I could go from London to L.A.
I could look a million times a day
The way I feel is never gonna change
It's never gonna change
They tell me that I'm young
And I should wait
But then you'd be the one who got away
The way I feel is never gonna change
And all that I can say

There's a billion girls in the world
But there's only one you (you)
A billion girls in the world
But there's only one you (you)

I must have died and gone to heaven
Or has an angel fallen from the sky
And everybody says I'm crazy, well maybe
But you are my kryptonite

I've try, try tried but they don't measure up
While all this time, time, time
You're spilling over the cup
And maybe I
And maybe I
Should listen to my head
But my heart says, says, says

I could go from London to L.A.
I could look a million times a day
The way I feel is never gonna change
And all that I can say

There's a billion girls in the world
But there's only one you (you)
A billion girls in the world
But there's only one you (you)

There's just something about you
That makes me feel like I want to
So baby hear when I tell you, it's true

There's a billion girls in the world
But there's only one
There's a billion girls in the world
But there's only one, one, one, one

I could go from London to L.A.
I could look a million times a day
The way I feel is never gonna change
It's never gonna change
They tell me that I'm young
And I should wait
But then you'd be the one who got away
The way I feel is never gonna change
And all that I can say

There's a billion girls in the world
But there's only one you (you)
A billion girls in the world
But there's only one you (you)
