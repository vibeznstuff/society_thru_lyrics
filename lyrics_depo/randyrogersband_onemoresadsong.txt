We're on a road to nowhere
I don't know how we got there
Some wrong turn somewhere
Maybe I just stopped trying
There's just no justifying and now we're dying

I can tell which way that you're leaning
Don't know what it is but I got a feelin'
You're almost all gone
I'm scared that when you start believing
You and me, baby, will end up being
One more sad song

How will I live without you?
Who will I be in these shoes?
Once I've lost all that I can lose
Even if you forgave me
I don't know if I could make it
But that's our whole problem, maybe

I can tell which way that you're leaning
Don't know what it is but I got a feelin'
You're almost all gone
I'm scared that when you start believing
You and me, baby, will end up being
One more sad song

About someone who had it all
Let it all go wrong

I can tell which way that you're leaning
Don't know what it is but I got a feelin'
You're almost all gone
I'm scared that when you start believing
You and me, baby, will end up being
One more sad song

I can tell which way that you're leaning
Don't know what it is but I got a feelin'
You're almost all gone
I'm scared that when you start believing
You and me, baby, will end up being
One more sad song
