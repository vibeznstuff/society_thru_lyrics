Flew out of London for the New York City
Ooh, look out boys a 'cause it looks so pretty
I'm in America, America-ca-ca, ahaha

Saw this nice man he came collect me from Kennedy
I said to DP is it New York City
He said America, America-ca-ca, aha
We're in America, America-ca-ca, ahaha

Well I really didn't wanna go there
But the man said (you gotta go)
Said I really didn't wanna go there
'Till I hit San Francisco

Well I landed in the desert in Phoenix
Drove out to K.U.P.D.
Say I landed in the desert in Phoenix
With the sun shinin' down on me

(Hey now you know you're in)
America, America-ca-ca, ahaha
Watch out!  
America, black cadillac car
We're in America, America-ca-ca, ahuha
Uh
Americaaaaaaaaahh
Americaaaaaaaaahh
Americaaaaaaaaahh
Black cadillac car America
Americaaaaaaaaahh
