I wanna be with you forever (ever, ever),
Baby me and you together (gether, gether),
I'll walk with you through stormy weather (weather, weather),
Me and you it's now or never (never, never), 
You know I've always had a crush on you,
I'm pretty sure you feel the same way too,
Do you wanna be together (gether, gether),
Me and You it's now or never (never, never),
It's now or never, boy.

You got my heart,
Right from the start,
I can't get enough, 
Could this be love?
I told you before,
I can't ignore,
I wanna know

When I'm around you, baby,
I can never shake this,
Feelin' that comes over me, 
You know that I'll be right here, baby,
They can say I'm crazy,
But I know I'm meant to be.

I wanna be with you forever (ever, ever),
Baby me and you together (gether, gether),
I'll walk with you through stormy weather (weather, weather),
Me and you it's now or never (never, never), 
You know I've always had a crush on you,
I'm pretty sure you feel the same way too,
Do you wanna be together (gether, gether),
Me and You it's now or never (never, never),
It's now or never, boy.

Can't take no more, 
I'm ready to go,
You already know,
You stay on my mind,
It's got to be,
Just you and me,
So you can see

When I'm around you, baby,
I can never shake this,
Feelin' that comes over me, 
You know that I'll be right here, baby,
They can say I'm crazy,
But I know I'm meant to be.

Met her on a Friday, 
Spoke on a Sunday.
She said I'm the one she liked,
Now we're the wrong way.
Ain't coming back for a while,
Will return one day. ( One day).
Buy a big house in the country,
We'll do somethin'.
Give her the real good lovin',( Lovin').
Just the way that she likes it, ( Likes it).
I see her in my future, ( I see you in my future).
I got the vision of a phsycic. 
She don't drive me mad,
She gotta good heart I'm glad.
Can't see it ever being over (over, over, over).
