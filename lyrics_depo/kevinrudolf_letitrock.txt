I see your dirty face
High behind your collar
What is done in vain
Truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie
Live a lie
Live a lie

And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed
I'm in mine


Because when I arrive
I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock


Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world
To the world
To the world

And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours
I got mine




Yeah!
Wayne's world
Planet Rock
Panties drop
And the tops
And she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela (rock)
And Pamela (rock)
And Samantha (rock)
And Amanda (rock)
And Tamara (rock)
"Ménage à trois" 
I'm in here like bitch what's up
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can dick you up
I can dick you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And the jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big ass rocks like off the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground
Weezy



Just Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock...
Let It Rock...


I'm back like I forgot somethin
I'm somethin
Ruling Rock rubbin' rap running'
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect I'll bang ya
Period, like the reminder


I wish I could be
As cruel as you
And I wish I could say
The things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie
No, not this time.
