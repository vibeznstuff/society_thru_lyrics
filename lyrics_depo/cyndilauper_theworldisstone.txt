Stone, the world is stone
It's no trick of the light, it's hard on the soul
Stone, the world is stone, cold to the touch
And hard on the soul in the gray of the streets

In the neon unknown, I look for a sign
That I'm not on my own, that I'm not here alone

As the still of the night and the choke of the air
And the winners' delight and the losers' despair
Closes in left and right, I would love not to care

Stone, the world is stone from a faraway look
Without stars in my eyes through the halls of the rich
And the flats of the poor wherever I go

There's no warmth anymore
There's no love anymore

So I turn on my heels, I'm declining the fall
I've had all I can take with my back to the wall
Tell the world I'm not in, I'm not taking the call

Stone, the world is stone but I saw it once
With the stars in my eyes when each color rang out
In a thunderous chrome, it's no trick of the light
I can't find my way home in a world of stone
