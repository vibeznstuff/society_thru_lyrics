Train this chaos turn it into light 
I've got to see you one last night 
Before the lions take their share 
Leave us in pieces scattered everywhere 

Just give me a chance to hold on 
Give me a chance to hold on 
Give me a chance to hold on 
Just give me something to hold onto 

It's so clear now that you are all that I have 
I have no fear cos you are all that I have 
It's so clear now that you are all that I have 
I have no fear cos you are all that I have 

You're cinematic razor sharp 
A welcome arrow through the heart 
Under your skin feels like home 
Electric shocks on aching bones 

Give me a chance to hold on 
Give me a chance to hold on 
Give me a chance to hold on 
Just give me something to hold onto 

It's so clear now that you are all that I have 
I have no fear cos you are all that I have 
It's so clear now that you are all that I have 
I have no fear cos you are all that I have 

There is a darkness deep in you 
A frightening magic I cling to 

Give me a chance to hold on 
Give me a chance to hold on 
Give me a chance to hold on 
Just give me something to hold onto 

It's so clear now that you are all that I have 
I have no fear now you are all that I have 
It's so clear now that you are all that I have 
I have no fear now you are all that I have
