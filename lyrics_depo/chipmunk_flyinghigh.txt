I'm running this jungle, can't touch me I'm hammer
and I'm a lion king, a kuna matatta
no worries at all, no footy, I ball
I'm on my Apple shit, women I'm Mac'ing 'em all
Capital summertime ball

Still putting on for my team
and stupid niggas wifey's
and all the girls like me
including the dikeys
the life of the party
my queen on my body
she smelling my neck, thats Issey Miyake
I keep it so cool, but I am no fool
these niggas with me don't know vocals but they pro-tools
pour me a glass, toast G
I'm fucking bossy, fuck being Lowkey (ooh!)
and you know I can rock a crowd
you feel that hook coming, lets sing it now

I'm stacking my chedder, I've never been better
it's now or its never, you know we flying high



(ay ay, ooh, ooh, ayy yeah)
I got 'em singing like
(ay ay, ooh, ooh, ayy yeah)
You know we flying high
You know we flying high
You know we flying high

(ay ay, ooh, ooh, ayy yeah)
I got 'em singing like
(ay ay, ooh, ooh, ayy yeah)
