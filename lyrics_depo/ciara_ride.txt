She ride it like a rollercoaster
Soon as I get her to the top she screams
I put her out like a light
She'll be out for the night
Soon as her head hit the pillows sweet dreams
Wake her up about 30mins later
Calling me the terminator, let's go again
Red zone, I'm a get her first down
Call me Luda Drew Brees I throw it in
Touch down
He scores
Ludacris the MVP
With a rack like that and a back like that
CiCi better CC me
Cause them legs just keep on going
So I gotta put her to bed
Let the 808 thump and the beat go bump
Cause she ride it like a thoroughbred

When I'm wirling this around

Oh baby baby you like it
When I take it up and down...
Oh baby he love it when

He love they way I ride it 
He love the way I ride the beat
