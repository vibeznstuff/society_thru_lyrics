Hello--how are you
Have you been alright, through all those lonely nights,
That's what I'd say, I'd tell you everything,
If you'd pick up that telephone.

Hey--how you feelin'
Are you still the same
Don't you realize the things we did were all for real not a dream,
I just can't believe
They've all faded out of view.

I look into the sky
(The love you need ain't gonna see you through.)
And I wonder why
(The little things are finally coming true.)


Telephone line, give me some time, I'm living in twilight
Telephone line, give me some time, I'm living in twilight

O.K. so no--one's answering,
Well can't you just let it ring a little longer
I'll just sit tight, through the shadows of the night
Let it ring for evermore.
