Ouuh

Girl I got you so high, and I know you like,
So come on push it on me, if it feels alright,
When you drop it low, and break me off,
No, she doesn't mind (aight)
She doesn't mind (aight)
She doesn't mind.

Girl I got you so!

Push it back on it, bring it back on it
Gimme the ting becah mi waah for lock on it
Wine it, wiggle it, set the chop on it
Two more shot, now we're in and up on it
Two girl, and I'm ready for jump on it
Two to my word, and I'm ready to jump on it
Ready for run on it, ready to jump on it
Tag teaming for you truck to pump on it

Hands up high, we burning up the sky
We got the dance hall crazy, got the club on fire
I like the way you dance, you got me in a trance
My baby she don't mind at all...
