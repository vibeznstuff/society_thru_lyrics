I've looked under chairs
I've looked under tables
I've tried to find the key
To fifty million fables

They call me The Seeker
I've been searchin' low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die

I asked Bobby Dylan
I asked the Beatles
I asked Timothy Leary
But he couldn't help me either

They call me The Seeker
I've been searchin' low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die

People tend to hate me
Coz I never smile
As I ransack their homes
They wanna' shake my hand

Focusing on nowhere
Investigating miles
I'm a seeker
I'm a really desperate man

I wont get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die

I learned how to raise my voice in anger
Yeah but look at my face ain't this a smile

I'm happy when life's good and when its bad I cry
I got values but I don't know how or why

I'm lookin' for me
You're lookin' for you
Were lookin' at each other and we don't know what to do

They call me The Seeker
I been searchin' low and high
I wont get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die
