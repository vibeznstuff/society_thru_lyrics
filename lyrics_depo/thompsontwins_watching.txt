Watching you... watching me
Watching you... watching me

I focus on a face in Samarkand
Accepting my reward
It brings alive my distant memories
They're my last resort

Watching you...watching me
(watching you...watching me)

A look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right

Dinosaurs are grazing in suburbia
They're glowing in the dark
Electrified they fight and fuss about
They're eating up the park

Watching you...watching me
(watching you...watching me)

A look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right

Watching you...watching me
(watching you...watching me)

A look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right

The circuit boards are linking up in rhyme
There is no reason why
Except the dreams of soft machines
We have no need to cry

Watching you...watching me
(watching you...watching me)

A look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right

Watching you... watching me
(watching you... watching me)
Watching you... watching me
(watching you... watching me)...

A look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
Look left, look right
A look left, look right....

I spend all of my time...
Watching...
Watching you watching me
Yeah, watching you watching me
Yeah, watching you watching me...
