Everybody knows that yeah I'm kinda shy 
And I'm not the kinda girl who could ever approach a guy 
But I wanna find a way to get you to notice me 
I got a four wheel drive, 5' 5", brown eyes, 
Then maybe you can handle these 
Because I'm free 


Free... single, sexy and sweet 
Makin' my own money 
Lookin' for the right party 
And if you're free... spit your best game at me 
If you like what you see 
Maybe I'll let you share my fantasy 


Now, I don't need a man in my life tryin' to tie me down 
And I don't wanna playa who got kids all over town 
Don't want his curl juice drippin' all over my Mercedes seat
I can't stand a man who thinks he looks better than me 
I'm lookin' for a brother who like to have fun 
A fly gentleman who knows how to please a woman 
The last thing I need is a man that's soft 
He betta get it on up and break me off 
Some a that fly high rise, 6' 5", ain't shy 
And that's the kinda man I need 
Because I'm free 


Free... single, sexy and sweet 
Makin' my own money 
Lookin' for the right party 
And if you're free... spit your best game at me 
If you like what you see 
Maybe I'll let you share my fantasy 




Mmm... If you're having a good time, just let go and don't be shy
Come on yeah... oh yeah 
If you're down to do whatever 
Then let's sing this song together 
I'm free, oh come on and be free with me 


Free... single, sexy and sweet 
Makin' my own money 
Lookin' for the right party 
And if you're free... spit your best game at me 
If you like what you see 
Maybe I'll let you share my fantasy 


Last Chance 
Ooh boy, you look so good to me, 
You might get lucky 
'Cause I feel free tonight, 
Are you available 
Did you come here alone, 
Won't you hang out with me 
I'll freak you on the dance floor 


Everybody in the house... high rise 
All the brothers up in here... 6' 5" 
Gotta get in on up... High rise 
You know you lookin' good tonight 
All the ladies in the house... 5' 5" 
Gotta show 'em whatcha got... thick thighs 
Freak 'em on the floor... Ain't shy 
You know you lookin' good tonight
