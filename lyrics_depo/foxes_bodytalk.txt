Days like these
I just want you back
I can't breathe
I can't even speak
No La la la la la la la

Gotta rise
Gotta fight
Cause it's something I wanted
Oh, he's got to go
I can see in the light
It's not right
Now I know
I don't need him

Ooh, let your body talk
Even when you feel so lost
Spinning when the tears
They fall, you gotta just let it go

La la la la la

Days like these
I don't want you back
Now I feel free
Gonna keep it like that yeah

Gotta rise
Gotta fight
Cause it's something I wanted
Oh, he's got to go
I can see in the light
It's not right
Now I know
I don't need him

Ooh, let your body talk
Even when you feel so lost
Spinning when the tears
They fall, you gotta just let it go

Ooh, let your body talk
Even when you feel so lost
Spinning when the tears
They fall, you gotta just let it go

Eh-eh-eh

Even when you feel so lost
Spinning when the tears
They fall, you gotta just let it go
