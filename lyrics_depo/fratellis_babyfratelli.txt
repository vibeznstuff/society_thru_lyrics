She said oh my, I don't know why
I was just busy watching everyone go by
Outside the shite bar, and you're a red car
Me and your girlfriend and your sister with the big scar

I said oh Christ, I told you twice
It's just not easy going through all these things thrice
What's this I once heard? You drive a bluebird?
You got no money for the petrol, that's what I heard

And it's all right, she'll be sucking fingers all night
Wearing those shoes, oh any excuse to go to the gang fight
And oh she's alright, everybody says she's uptight
Sick in the head, first in the bed
So easy to be Friday's nightmare

I said oh no, oh please just go
You got no eyelids and sweet ella loves me so
She got my number, though I can't stand her
I can't help diggin her a hope I guess I wonder
And oh it's clear, you want me dear
It would be easier if I was never here
You got the money, and I got the reason,
I'll stick around with you for just another season

And it's alright, she'll be sucking fingers all night
Wearing those shoes, oh any excuse to go to the gang fight
And oh she's alright, everybody says she's uptight
Sick in the head, first in the bed
So easy to be Friday's nightmare

She's just getting along,
So don't tell me she's yours
Oh please tell me I'm wrong again
It's all in a daze/day,
So what can you say
Just; sleep in yer shoes
With the winterbox blues
Any time you choose, Oh yeah

She said oh my, I don't know why
I was just busy watching everyone go by
Outside the shite bar, and you're a red car
Me and your girlfriend and your sister with the big scar

She said oh Christ, I told you twice
It's just not easy going through all these things thrice
What's this I once heard? You drive a bluebird?
You got no money for the petrol, that's what I heard

And it's alright, she'll be sucking fingers all night
Wearing those shoes, oh any excuse to go to the gang fight
And oh she's alright, everybody says she's uptight
Sick in the head, first in the bed
So easy to be Friday's wonder
