Dench!

See her in the gym doing two squats
Tight leggings on she don't do socks
She tryna get something happening
Tryna get that booty like Kim Kardashian
Tryna get like the emoji fruit
Tryna get right for her birthday suit
Tryna get her right and the jeans was a struggle
Bottom half BBW and her face look cute

Yeah
All she wanna do is wine it
Now she got audience it
Yeah
If you was a hit I would sign it
Yeah
All day, press play and rewind it

She got the wobble
Wob-wob, wobbling 

Her future's high beaming, yeah that right
Best of both worlds yeah that type
See her in the club and she look right
Jeans are Arsene Wenger, yeah fam that tight
She's my new signing, the one I'm pursuing
Allure of other interests, but don't know what they're doing
Windows shopping, all they do is viewing
Promise you the world, all they do is ruin

Yeah
I wanna see you wine it
Yeah
You know you got audience behind it
Yeah
If you was a hit I would sign it
Yeah
All day, press play and rewind it

She got the wobble
Wob-wob, wobbling 

I wanna see you go down, go down low
I wanna see how far, how low you can go
I wanna see you go down, go down low
I wanna see you wobble, wobble some mo'
I wanna see you go down, go down low
I wanna see how far, how low you can go
I wanna see you go down, go down low
I wanna see you wobble, wobble some mo'

She got the wobble
Wob-wob, wobbling
