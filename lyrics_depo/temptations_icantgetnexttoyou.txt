I
 Can turn a gray sky blue.
 I can make it rain, whenever I wanted to.
Oh, I
 I can build a castle from a single grain of sand.
 I can make a ship sail, uh, on dry land.

 But my life is incomplete and I'm so blue. 'Cause I can't get next to you.

I can't get next to you, babe. (Next to you)
I can't get next to you. (I just can't get next you)
I can't get next to you, babe.
I can't get next to you.

I
 Can fly like a bird in the sky.
 Hey, and I can buy anything that money can buy.
Oh, I
 I can turn a river into a raging fire.
 I can live forever if I so desired.

 Unimportant are all the things I can do. 'Cause I can't get next to you.

I can't get next to you, babe. (No matter what I do)
I can't get next to you.
Uh-ya



Ooo-Ooo
Ooo-Ooo
Chica boom, chica boom
Chica boom, boom, boom

 I can turn back the hands of time, you better believe I can.
I
 I can make the seasons change, just by waving my hand.
Oh, I
 I can change anything from old to new.
 The things I want to do the most, I'm unable to do.

 Unhappy am I with all the powers I possess. 'Cause girl you're the key to my happiness.
 And I

Can't get next to you.


Girl, you're blowing my mind 'cause I can't get...(Next to you)
Can't you see these tears I'm crying? I can't get... (Next to you)
Girl, it's you that I need. I gotta get...(Next to you)
Can't you see these tears I'm crying? I can't get... (Next to you)
I, I, I, I... I can't get...(Next to you)
I, I, I, I... I can't get...(Next to you)
Girl, you're blowing my mind...
