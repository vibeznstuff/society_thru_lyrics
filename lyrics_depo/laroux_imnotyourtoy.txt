Love, love is like a stubborn youth
That you'd rather just deny
I'm walking on a broken roof
While I'm looking at the sky

It's all false love and affection
You don't want me, you just like the attention
Yes, it's all false love and affection
You don't like me, you just want the attention

I'm not your toy
And this isn't another girl meets boy 

Love, love hides in a smoky light
I can never find the truth
Boy, your touches leave me mystified
I wish I could believe in you

Yes, it's all false love and affection
You don't want me, you just like the attention
Yes, it's all false love and affection
You don't like me, you just want the attention


I'm not your toy
And this isn't another girl meets boy

It's all false love and affection
You don't want me, you just like the attention
Yes, it's all false love and affection
You don't like me, you just want the attention


I'm not your toy
And this isn't another girl meets boy
I'm not your toy
Oh, this isn't another girl meets boy
