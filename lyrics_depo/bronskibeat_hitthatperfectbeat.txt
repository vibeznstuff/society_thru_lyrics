Searching for some company
Feel the rhythm dance with me
Them beat boy blues seem out of place
Now they want to party pace party pace

Dance dance on the floor
Dance dance move some more
Dance dance feel the heat
Hit that perfect beat boy, hit that perfect beat beat boy

I've got that feeling them beat boy feelings
I've got them feeling the perfect beat
I've got that feeling that perfect feeling
That perfect feeling all over me

Beat boy beat boy hit that perfect beat boy
Beat boy beat boy hit that perfect beat boy
Beat boy beat boy hit that perfect beat boy
Hit that perfect hit that perfect hit that perfect beat boy

Come come close to me I want this to be
That perfect feeling all over me
Come come close to me I want this to be
That beat boy feeling all over me

Too close for comfort too close for joy
Boys in the back room their hearts destroy
Touch and kiss a stranger if all else fails
Hiding from the danger that's been sent from hell

I've got that feeling them beat boy feelings
I've got them feeling the perfect beat
I've got that feeling that perfect feeling
That perfect feeling all over me

Beat boy beat boy hit that perfect beat boy
Beat boy beat boy beat beat beat beat
Beat boy beat boy hit that perfect beat boy
Hit that perfect hit that perfect hit that perfect beat boy
