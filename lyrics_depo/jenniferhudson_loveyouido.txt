Never met a man
Quite like you
Doing all you can
Making my dreams come true

You're strong and you're smart
You've taken my heart
And I'll give you the rest of me too

You're the perfect man for me
I love you I do

Mm I love ya

Never have I felt
Quite like this
Good about myself
From my very first kiss
I'm here when you call
You've got it all
And confidence like I never knew

You're the perfect man for me
I love you I do

You've got the charm
You simply disarm me every time
As long as you drive 
I'm along for the ride
Your way
I said it before 
There won't be a door 
That's closed to us
I'm putting all my trust in you
Cause you, you'll always be true, Oh

I never could have known
This would be, 
Oh you and you alone, yeah
Are all for me
I know you're the best 
You've passed every test
It's almost too good to be true

You're the perfect man for me
I love you I do

You're the perfect man for me
I love you I do
