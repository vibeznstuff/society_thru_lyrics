Long time ago 
The times we had were so and so 
It was the worst date of your life 
So I called you home your so called father was on the phone 
He wasnt easy to ignore 

But were all happy cause the streets there are always there for us 
And its quite scary when you wake up in the same old clubs 
Its getting darker and I know time wasnt meant for us 
So wont you please please please come back to me 

But yesterday when I saw your eyes in a black haze 
You didnt even know my name 
So I walked on pretending that you still belong 
But it will never be the same no more 

But were all happy cause the streets there are always there for us 
And its quite scary when you wake up in the same old clubs 
Its getting darker and I know time wasnt meant for us 
So wont you please please please come back to me 

Its like a picture of a loved one in disguise or 
Its like finding something pretty energized and 
If you want just hide your eyes behind your head 
But you cant see me then you cant find me anywhere 

But were all happy cause the streets there are always there for us 
And its quite scary when you wake up in the same old clubs 
Its getting darker and I know time wasnt meant for us 
So wont you please please please come back to me 

Come back to me 
Please please please 
Please please please
