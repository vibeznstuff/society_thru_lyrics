Just another broken heart
Any fool can see
Though we're living worlds apart
Well, you're still next to me

I'm never going to give you up
I never want to make you cry
Never going to give you up
Never going to say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Don't want to say goodbye

It's just another lonely night
I'm missing you again
Nothing ever turns out right
So when's it going to end?

I said I'm never going to give you up
I never want to make you cry
Never going to give you up
Never going to say goodbye
When you start talking love

You know that I'd run through the night to be with you
Talk about love
It's a walk from the dark to the light to be with you
Start talking love
Talk about love

You left me with a broken heart
Any fool can see
Now we're living worlds apart
Guess it was meant to be

I said I'm never going to give you up, oh, no
I never want to make you cry
Never going to give you up
Never going to say goodbye
Come on

When you start talking love
You know that I'd run through the night to be with you
Talk about love
It's a walk from the dark to the light to be with you
Start talking love
You know that I'd run through the night to be with you
Talk about love
Talk about love
To be with you

When you start talking love
You know that I'd run through the night to be with you
Talk about love
It's a walk from the dark to the light to be with you
Start talking love
You know that I'd run through the night to be with you
