She, she ain't real,
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will

She is a stranger,
You and I have history,
Or don't you remember?

Sure, she's got it all,
But, baby, is that really what you want?

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you
And, boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core,
Now rumour has it she ain't got your love anymore

Rumour has it 

Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now.
I heard that your dreams came true.
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you.

Rumour has it 

Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds,
You made a fool out of me,
And, boy, you're bringing me down,
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core,
But rumour has it I'm the one you're leaving her for,

Rumour has it 

Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said,

Rumour has it 

Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said,

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said,
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead,
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead.
