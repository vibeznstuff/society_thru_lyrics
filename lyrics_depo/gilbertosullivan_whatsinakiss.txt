What's in a kiss?
Have you ever wondered just what it is?
More, perhaps, than just a moment of bliss
Tell me what's in a kiss

What's in a dream?
Is it all the things you'd like to have been?
All the places that you haven't yet seen?
Tell me what's in a dream

I know it's really rather stupid of me
But I honestly don't know
Every time I try to find a solution
I'm surprised at how quickly I become so slow.

What's in a kiss?
Have you ever wondered just what it is?
More perhaps than just a moment of bliss
Tell me what's in a kiss

An any time you need a light refreshment
Baby, you can count on my
I am your very own delicatessen
While equipped to supply you if you're ever in need

What's in a kiss?
Have you ever wondered just what it is?
More perhaps than just a moment of bliss
Tell me what's in a kiss
Tell me what's in a kiss
Tell me what's in a kiss
