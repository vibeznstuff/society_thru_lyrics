For a second ill be the fashion police and im just looking at your garms you been on too many catalogue sprees
With your grannyfied curtain designs, your hurting my eyes,
You really should revise your dress sense before you walk on by,
Im kinda mixed up in this disco inferno,
Baggy jeans and a tight top, lemonade and pernod
Im sticking out like a sore thumb but i aint concerned though, no, uh oh,oh oh oh (boogie)


Fling on an A D I D A S hoodie and just boogie woogie with me 
Ohhhhh...
Or you can just. put on your dancing shoes and get loose
Can you get loose can you??


So i was up in this trendy bar mingling
My keys around my neck were jingling
And you was looking at me like it was my bling
You was staring at me like to say i was ginger
I was dishing out out the same dirty looks trust me your the minger

Errrr, whos she, whos that, whos her??
The bouncer was approaching me coz i was dressed really inappropriately
No hood, no hats, no this, no that
Lets rolluh olll uh olll ..(out)



Right everybody, if youve got someone who cant dress properly, yeah you need to direct them this way.


Why not just cut up all your old clothes and make a quilt so i can wrap myself up when im feeling cold,
Why not dash your ugly boots on the fire and burn them down to charcoal,
If your not feeling the way that your bedrin is dressing dont be stressing send them in my direcion please,
Black shoes , white socks, no uhh ohhh
Polka dots, no uhh ohhh
Flowery frocks, no uhh ohhh
Just boogie woogie with me!!!
