If you squeeze my lizard
I'll put my snake on you
I'm a romantic adventure
And I'm a reptile too


But it don't make no difference
'cos I ain't gonna be, easy, easy
the only time I'm gonna be easy's when I'm
Killed by death 

I'm a lone wolf ligger
But I ain't no pretty boy
I'm a backbone shiver
and I'm a bundle of joy



But it don't make no difference
'cos I ain't gonna be, easy, easy
the only time I'm gonna be easy's when I'm
Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
