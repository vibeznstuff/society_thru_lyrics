I think they call it love
It's nothing to be scared about - believe me
ain't nothing we can do
just let it be a part of you - and feel it


I wanna let you know
I promise, I promise
to never let you go you know,... you know


We can make it good
we can make it right
we can make the shadows turn to light
boy when it feels like this,
when it feels like this
It's some kind of perfect bliss,... some kind of perfect bliss
we don't need to hurt
we don't need the pain
we can be the sun behind the rain
boy when it feels like this,
when it feels like this
It's some kind of perfect bliss


You're scared it's gonna change
you say you need a guarantee,... just leave it
You'll look but you won't find
Don't you know that love is blind,... just feel it


I wanna let you know
I promise, I promise
to never let you go you know... you know


We can make it good
we can make it right
we can make the shadows turn to light
boy when it feels like this,
when it feels like this
It's some kind of perfect bliss,... some kind of perfect bliss
we don't need to hurt
we don't need the pain
we can be the sun behind the rain
boy when it feels like this,
when it feels like this
It's some kind of perfect bliss


It's A to Z, it's chemistry, it's meant to be
It's everything, it's all we need, just let it be

yeah........


I wanna let you know
I promise, I promise
to never let you go you know... you know


We can make it good
we can make it right
we can make the shadows turn to light
boy when it feels like this,
when it feels like this
It's some kind of perfect bliss
we don't need to hurt
we don't need the pain
we can be the sun behind the rain
boy when it feels like this,
when it feels like this
It's some kind of perfect bliss


Some kind of love
Some kind of feeling
Some kind of miracle
Yeah...
Some kind of perfect bliss
