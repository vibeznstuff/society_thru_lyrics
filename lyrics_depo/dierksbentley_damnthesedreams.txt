I remember hearin' Hank on the radio
The first time it felt like fallin' in love
I bought a cassette, stole some Reds from Dad
And me and ol' Junior just burned it up
I was hooked like a fish
Every birthday wish was guitars and records
Now honey I know you miss me
I feel it when you kiss me
Trust me when I say every goodbye hurts

Well, damn these dreams
Playin' my heart just like a guitar string
Pull me away from you and everything I really need
Well, damn these dreams
Chasin' that same old whiskey melody
All up and down these Nashville streets
It's hard to look true love in the eye and leave
Well, damn these dreams

Well, I remember hearin' my song on the radio
The first time it felt like some kinda drug
Out there on the road playing show after show
Me and the boys just burnin' it up
It was all fun and games 'til the little ones came
'Cause it makes my heart bleed
When I gotta drive away and listen to 'em say
Hey daddy, why you gotta go, please don't leave

Well, damn these dreams
Playin' my heart just like a guitar string
Pullin' me away from you and everything I really need
Well, damn these dreams
Chasin' that same old whiskey melody
All up and down every small town street
It's hard to look true love in the eye and leave
Well, damn these dreams

Well, damn these dreams

Well, it's in my heart and it's in my soul
And just like you, I never can let go
These wheels just gotta roll

Cause I remember hearin' Hank on the radio
The first time it felt like fallin' in love
