A sense of duty
Was my one intention 
And an ugly beauty 
Was my own invention 
Pride a proud refusal 
And I refuse 
to need your approval 
Too many seekers 
Too few beacons 
But through the fog 
We'll keep on beaming 

Through the crying hours 
Of your glitter years 
All the living out 
Of your tinsel tears 
And the midnight trains 
I never made 
'Cause I'd already 
Played... the game 

Everybody's 
Got their own good reason 
Why their favorite season 
Is their favorite season 
Winter winners 
And those summer sons 
Aren't good for everyone 
Aren't good for everyone 
Spring has sprung 
And autumn's well done 
So well done 

And it's a better thing 
That we do now 
Forgetting everything 
The whys and hows 
While you reminisce 
About the things you miss 
You won't be ready 
To kiss... goodbye 

The earth is a world 
The world is a ball 
A ball in a game 
With no rules at all 
And just as I wonder 
At the beauty of it all 
You go and drop it 
And it breaks and falls 

I'll never understand 
Why you thought I would 
Need to be reassured 
And be understood 
When I always knew 
That your bad's my good 
And I was ready 
Ready... to be loved 

Born under Mars 
With Jupiter rising 
Fallen from stars 
That lit my horizon 

I'll never understand 
Why you thought I would 
Need to be reassured 
And be understood 
When I always knew 
That your bad's my good 
And I was ready 
Ready... to be 

Through the crying hours 
Of your glitter years 
All the living out 
Of your tinsel tears 
And the midnight trains 
I never made 
'Cause I'd already 
Played 

It's a better thing 
That we do now 
Forgetting everything 
The whys and hows 
While you reminisce 
About the things you miss 
You won't be ready 
To kiss... goodbye
