Hey baby, looking good to me.
Hey baby, I like what I see.
I'm ready, I'm ready for love.
What you say, we just forget the drill.
Full metal jacket, I'm shooting to kill.
I'm ready, I'm ready for love.

Don't you know that it's cold outside.
Come on in, I'll keep you satisfied.
Just like that moon up above,
I'm out tonight and I'm ready for love.

I'm getting ready, I'm ready for love.
I'm ready, I'm ready for love.
Oooh!
Come over baby.

Hey baby, won't you tell me your sign.
What do you know, it's the same one as mine.
I'm ready, I'm ready for love.
You hear me knockin', but you won't let me in.
Open the door, honey let the fall begin.
I'm ready, I'm ready for love.

You say you will, then you say you won't.
Now you see it, then you don't.
Just like that moon up above,
It's out tonight and I'm ready for love.

I'm getting ready, I'm ready for love.
I'm getting ready, I'm ready for love.

Every day in the week, I'm in a different city.
Every day in the week
somebody tries to hold me down.

Your place or mine, honey?

Don't you know that it's cold outside.
Come on in, I'll keep you satisfied.
Just like that moon up above,
I'm out tonight and I'm ready, ready, ready, ready.

I'm out tonight and I'm ready for love.
I'm ready for love.
I'm out tonight and I'm ready for love.
I'm ready for love.

Ready, I'm ready for love.
I'm getting ready, I'm ready for love.
I'm getting ready, I'm ready for love.
Oooh!
I'm getting ready, I'm ready for love.
Just like that moon up above.
Ready, I'm ready for love.
I'm getting ready, I'm ready for love.
Ready, I'm getting ready for love.
I'm getting ready.
Ooh, just like that moon up above.

Oooh
