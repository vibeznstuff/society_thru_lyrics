our love is like water
pinned down and abused for being strange
our love is no other
than me alone for me all day
our love is like water/angels pinned down and abused

all over you, all over me
the sun, the fields, the sky
I've often tried to hold
the sea the sun, the fields, the tide
pay me now,
lay me down
