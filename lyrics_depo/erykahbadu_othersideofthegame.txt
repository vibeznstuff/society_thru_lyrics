What you gon' do when they come for you
Work ain't honest but it pays the bills
What we gon' do when they come for you
Gave me the life that I came to live

Do I really want my baby
Brother tell me
What to do
I know you got to get your hustle on
So I prayed
I understand the game sometimes
And our love is strong

What you gon' do when they come for you
Work ain't honest but it pays the bills
Yes, it does
What we gon' do when they come for you
God, I can't stand life without you

Now me and baby got this situation
See brother got this complex occupation
And it ain't that he don't have education
'Cause I was right there at his graduation
And I ain't saying that this life don't work
But it's me and baby that he hurts
Because I tell him right he thinks I'm wrong
But I love him strong

He gave me the life that I came to live
He gave me the song that I came to give
Pressure's on me but the seed has grown
I can't make it on my own
Summer came around and the flowers bloomed
He became the sun I became the moon
Precious gifts that we both received
But could this be make believe?

What you gon' do when they come for you
Work ain't honest but it pays the bills
Work ain't honest but it pays the bills
What we gon' do when they come for you
He gave me the life that I came to live
Yes, you did

Don't worry, baby, I know there's confusion
God's gonna see us through yeah
Peace after revolution
But we paid though

(Don't you worry.)
What you gonna do
(Keep your body.)
What you gonna do
(Work ain't honest but it pays the bills.)
Yes, it does
(Don't you worry.)
Try not to worry 'bout it
(Keep your body.)
(Gave me the life that I came to live.)
Yes, you did
(Don't you worry.)
(Keep your body.)
(Work ain't honest but it pays the bills.)
Work ain't honest but it pays the bills
(Don't you worry bout it.)
(Keep your body.)

He gave me the life that I came to live
He gave me the song that I came to give
Pressure's on me but the seed has grown
I can't make it on my own

Summer came around and the flowers bloomed
He became the sun I became the moon
Precious gifts that we both received
But could this be make believe?

Oh yeah
Badu is with you baby, mm mm mm
We gon' make it, yeah
Me, you, and the baby
What you gonna do
What you gonna do, no, oh

See I ain't trying to run your life
But I want you to do what's right, yeah
I'm your wife, mm mm mm

Ooh, peace out to revolution
I know there's confusion
Gotta do what you gotta do now
My love is strong
