Wasn't looking for trouble, but it came looking for me
I tried to say no but I can't fight it she was looking lovely
She kinda reminds me of a girl I know
This pretty young thing that I got waiting for me back at home

She's got my engines turning this happens every time
I see a pretty girl and I wanna make her mine
They send my rocket to the sky I want them
But should I go for them? I'm like
Houston I think we got a problem
Problem problem problem... Girls girls girls girls...

Girls Girls Girls I just can't say no
Never see them coming I just watch them go
Girls Girls Girls I just can't say no
Never see them coming I just wa-wa-wa-wa-watch them go
Take control, making me sweat girl run that show
It's them Girls Girls Girls I just can't say no
Houston I think we got a problem

Some girls are naughty some girls are sweet
One thing they got in common they all got a hold on me
Meet them at the party meet them in the street
Getting me in so much trouble but that's alright with me

They got my engines turning this happens every time
I see a pretty girl and I wanna make her mine
They send my rocket to the sky I want them
But should I go for them? I'm like Houston I think we got a problem
Problem problem problem... Girls girls girls girls...

Girls Girls Girls I just can't say no
Never see them coming I just watch them go
Girls Girls Girls I just can't say no
Never see them coming I just wa-wa-wa-wa-watch them go
Take control, making me sweat girl run that show
It's them Girls Girls Girls I just can't say no
Houston Houston Houston Houston Houston I think we got a problem

Looking like a model making me stare
All them pretty girls are standing right there
Doing that thing it's just not fair
How come all the pretty girls are up in here
