I'm lucky
I'm lucky
I can walk under ladders
Yes I'm so lucky
That I'm as lucky
As me

Struck it rich
Dirty rich
No work
And get richer
And the world
Loves a winner
Yes I'm so happy
That you're happy
With me

You are happy too
Ain't you baby

Numero uno
Living for 
Right now
And it's
L-I-V-I-N-G
When I'm here 
With you

I'm lucky
I'm lucky
I don't need a bracelet
No salt
For my shoulder
I don't own a rabbit
No clover
No heather
No cross
No wonder
I'm lucky
