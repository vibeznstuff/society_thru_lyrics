Take me away, I know 
I could use the rest.
I wanna clear up this mess.
I need a few days, 
with my good sense.
I need a few good days.
Benjamin, no.. oh.. 
Benjamin, no.. 
where did you go? No, no..
When you were falling from my tree, 
I was not scared.
I thought you'd 
meet me back up there.
It never dawned on me 
you were home free.
It never dawned on me, no.
Benjamin, no.. oh.. 
Benjamin, no.. where 
did you go? No, no..
You said that I could 
tie you down, no 
Take me away, I know 
I could use the rest.
