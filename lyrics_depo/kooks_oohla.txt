In their eyes is a place that you finally discovered
That you love it here, you've got to stay
On the bottom of the rock, an island
On which you find you love it when you twitch
You feel that itch in you pettycoat
Your pretty pretty pettycoat

Then you smiled, he got wild
You didn't understand that there's money to be made
Beauty is a card that must get played
By organisation

And ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
And ooh la, the world just chewed her up and spat her out
And ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
And ooh la, the world just chewed her up and spat her out

The world can be a very big place
So be yourself don't get out of place
Love your man and love him twice
Go to Hollywood and pay the price
Oh go to Hollywood

And don't be a star, it's such a drag
Take care of yourself, don't begin to lag
It's a hard life to live, so live it well
I'll be your friend and not in pretend
I know you girl
In all situations

And ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
And ooh la, the world just chewed her up and spat her out
And ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
And ooh la, the world just chewed her up and spat her out

Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty
Pretty pretty pettycoat
Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty
Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pettycoat
In all situations

And ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
And ooh la, the world just chewed her up and spat her out
And ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
And ooh la, the world just chewed her up and spat her out
