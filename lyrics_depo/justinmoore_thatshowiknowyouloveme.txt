I remember back when I'd go places
a desperate wind wouldn't even blow,
I ran with the outskirt crowd loud
and proud, burnin' up the road.
Pourin' whiskey on the fire
Spinnin' tires and never hit the brakes.
'Cause that just means you're weak

But you,
You never tried to change me
You just tried to save me
And you, you found a way to trust me
Despite the broken pieces of me,
That's how I know you love me
That's how I know you love me

Every man tries to stand tall
Never fall or let love knock him down
Run on through the night
Shootin' out the lights on the heartless
Side of town
Tonight here in the dark I'll hold ya
in my arms and never let you go.
While you kiss away the ghosts

Yeah you, you never tried to change me
You just tried to save me
And you, you found a way to trust me
Despite the broken pieces of me,
That's how I know you love me
That's how I know you love me

Yeah, you never tried to break me
You just found a way to wake me
And you, you found a way to trust me
Despite the broken pieces of me
That's how I know you love me
That's how I know you love me

Yeah, how I know you love me
Yeah, that's how I know you love me baby
Ohh yeah yeah
