Baby you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
we're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven

oh thinking about our younger years
there was only you and me
we were young and wild and free
Now nothing can take you away from me
we've been down that road before
but that's over now
you keep me coming back for more

Baby you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
we're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
We're in heaven

Now nothing can change what you mean to me
there's a lot that I can say
but just hold me now
cuz our love will light the way 

Baby you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
we're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven

Now ourdreams are coming true
through the good times and the bad
I'll be standing there by you

we're in heaven
love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
it isn't to hard to see 
we're in heaven

We're in heaven
