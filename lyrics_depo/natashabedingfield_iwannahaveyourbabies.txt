What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas
But what if it don't?
What happens in my head stays in my head
But sometimes it won't
What if you knew what I was thinking
Would it make you like WOHHHHH!
Don't wanna risk puttin' my foot in it
So ill keep my mouth closed!

All you hear is...

mmm mmm m m m m
Gonna button my lip So the truth don't slip
mmm mmm m m m m m
Gotta beep out what I really wanna shout
Woops Did I say it out loud, did you find out
I wanna have your babies
It's serious like crazy
I wanna have your babies
I see 'em springing up like daisies

Some of my feelings keep escapin'
so I make it a joke
Nonchalant I keep on fakin'
So my heart don't get broke
I'm in a big big big big ocean in a tiny little boat
Ill only put the idea out there If I know its gonna float

All you hear is...

mmm mmm m m m m m
Gonna button my lip
So the truth don't slip
mmm mmm m m m m m
Gotta beep out
What I really wanna shout
Woops Did I say it out loud
Did you find out
I wanna have your babies
It's serious like crazy
I wanna have your babies
I see 'em springing up like daisy's
In my head there's a slot machine
And I'm bettin' you're the one in my hopes and dreams

Trust me it would scare you if you knew what was goin' on in my brain
Trust me it would scare you that I've picked out the church all the schools all the names
If you knew it was all about you every wish Every candle every coin in a fountain
Trust me it would scare you

Thats why I go...

mmm mmm m m m m m

mmm mmm m m m m m

Gonna button my lip
So the truth don't slip
mmm mmm m m m m m
Gotta beep out
What I really wanna shout
Woops Did I say it out loud
Did you find out
I wanna have your babies
It's serious like crazy
I wanna have your babies
I see 'em springing up like daisy's

mmm mmm m m m m m

Gonna button my lip
So the truth don't slip
mmm mmm m m m m m
Gotta beep out
What I really wanna shout
Woops Did I say it out loud
Did you find out
I wanna have your babies
It's serious like crazy
I wanna have your babies
I see 'em springing up like daisy's

mmm mmm m m m m m
