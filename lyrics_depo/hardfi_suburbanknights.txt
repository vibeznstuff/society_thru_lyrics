Suburban days, they last so long,
In shop and office,
We sing our song we all sing...

We ain't got nothing, nothing to do,
A big fat nothing, Nothing for me, Nothing for you...

Suburban dreams, Just out of reach,
Work til you die, that's what they teach you at school,
With that in mind, what's there to lose?
My friends and I, doped up on tv fags and booze.

Hear them all singing...


We're the ones that you've forgotten,
But we will not be denied,
Coming out of the shadows,
We rock the satellites!

Suburban Nights, They get so hot,
People get angry, We sing our song we all sing...

A Global terror they say, We are at war,
But I ain't got time for that cos,
These bills keep dropping through my door


We're the ones that you've forgotten,
Out of mind, out of sight,
Coming out of the shadows,
We rock the satellites!

All these people who, criticize us,
We're only saying what we're seeing with our own eyes..

This one way system, It ain't - It ain't paradise,
Not everybody, Wants to race, wants to fight...

Hear them all singin...


We're the ones that you've forgotten,
But we will not be denied,
Coming out of the shadows,
We rock the satellites!

We're the ones that you've forgotten,
Out of mind out of sight,
Coming out of the shadows,
Coming live via satellite...
