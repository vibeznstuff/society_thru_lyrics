Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring tingle tingling too 
Come on, its lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, 
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling Yoo hoo, 
Come on, its lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you. 

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we 
Were snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be 
Lets take the road before us and sing a chorus or two 
Come on, its lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.
