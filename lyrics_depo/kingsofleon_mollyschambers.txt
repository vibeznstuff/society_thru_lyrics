Free- is all that she could bleed
That's why'll she'll never stay
White- bare naked in the night
Just lookin' for some play
Just another girl that wants to rule the world
Any time or place
And when she gets into your head
You know she's there to stay

You want it
She's got it
Molly's Chambers gonna change your mind
She's got your
Your pistol

Slow- She's burnin' in your soul
With whispers in your ear
It's okay I'll give it anyway
Just get me out of here
You'll plead- you'll get down on your knees
For just another taste
And when you think she's let you in
That's when she fades away

You want it
She's got it
Molly's Chambers gonna change your mind
She's got your
Your pistol
