Try to forget about it 
Ordinary things:typical predictable 
Baby I knew the end before it started 
You got me feelin' like I owed you something 
'Cause you were there at times when I had nothing 
But you threw it all away 
With the shady things you do 

Baby please forgive me 
For what I'm about to say 
And what I'm about to do 
I can't take no more 
I know you ain't been true 
Ain't got no love for you 


You've been cheatin' and tellin' me lies 
You've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night 
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight 
And you've been messin' round and lyin' down 
It's over now 



I ignore my intuition 
And pass it off as a suspicion 
But you were just so bold 
You kept puttin' it in my face 
I can't deny I let you hurt me 

Baby please forgive me 
For what I'm about to say 
And what I'm about to do 
I can't take no more 
I know you ain't been true 
Ain't got no love for you 



When you were down I helped to pick you up 
Instead you kept lookin' for the one 
When all the while what you were searching for 
Was in front of your face 
Just forget it:you'll regret it 
It's really over now 
Just turn around and watch me walk 
I'm gone
