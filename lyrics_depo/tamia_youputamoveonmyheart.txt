baby I just want you to understand
just exactly how you make me feel

Oh yeah

I wanna feel you next to me

Oh..... time after time, when I'm feeling low
somethin inside of me lets me know it's alright
loves on my side
when the world...seems a lonely place
I've got a dream that wont leave a trace of the blues
I just think of you baby I know


I've got a real thing here by my side
someone who needs me holding me tight
and these special feelings wont ever fade
cause I knew from the start you put a move on my heart

baby our loves like a melody playing for us
in the sweetest key you could find the music of life
and when we touch theres the warmest glow
heat in the passion that heaven knows its a dream
just for you, you and me...and baby I know


I've got a real thing the love of my life
someone who needs me and he feels me with pride
baby now, now and forever, we'll never part
cause you're the world to me you put a move on my heart

I got a real love yes I do, and you're someone baby
you're someone baby, someone that needs true love
and these, these special feelings, time can embrace
baby, believe me this ain't a dreaming
Sugar, I knew, I knew from the start, you put a move on me
Oh you got through to my heart
