Ooooooh, Oooooooh, Ooooooh, hey!

It’s 72 degrees
Zero chance of rain
It’s been a perfect day
We’re all spinning on our heels
So far away from real
In California

We watched the sunset from our car
We all took it in
And by the time that it was dark
You and me had something, yeah!

And if this is what we’ve got
Then what we’ve got is gold
We’re shining bright and I want you
I want you to know

The morning’s on it’s way
Our friends all say goodbye
There’s nowhere else to go
I hope that you’ll stay the night
Ooooooh, you'll stay the night
Ooooooh, yeah!

We’ve been singing Billie Jean
Mixin’ vodka with caffeine
We’ve got strangers stopping by
And though you’re out of tune
Girl you blow my mind, you do
And all I’ll say is I don’t wanna say good night

There’s no quiet corner
To get to know each other
Then there’s no hurry
I’m a patient man as you'll discover

Cause if this is what we’ve got
Then what we’ve got is gold
We’re shining bright and I want you
I want you to know

The morning’s on it’s way
Our friends all say goodbye
There’s nowhere else to go
I hope that you’ll stay the night
Ooooooh, you'll stay the night
Ooooooh, yeah!

Just like the song on our radio set
We’ll share the shelter of my single bed
But it’s a different tune that’s stuck in my head
And it goes...

If this is what we’ve got
Then what we’ve got is gold
We’re shining bright and I want you
I want you to know

The morning’s on it’s way
Our friends all say goodbye
There’s nowhere else to go
I hope that you’ll stay the night

If this is what we’ve got
Then what we’ve got is gold
We’re shining bright and I want you
I want you to know

The morning’s on it’s way
Our friends all say goodbye
There’s nowhere else to go
I hope that you’ll stay the night
