Let me tell you 'bout this girl
Maybe I shouldn't
I met her in Philly and her name was Brown Sugar
See, we be making love constantly
That's why my eyes are a shade blood burgundy

The way that we kiss is unlike any other way
That I be kissin' when I'm kissin' what I'm missin'
Won't you listen

Brown Sugar babe, I gets high off your love
I don't know how to behave


I want some of your Brown Sugar
Sugar 
Oohooh

Oh Sugar when you're close to me
You love me right down to my knees
And whenever you let me hit it
Sweet like the honey when it comes to me
Skin is caramel with those cocoa eyes
Even got a big sister by the name of Chocolate Thai

Brown Sugar babe, I gets high off your love
I don't know how to behave

I want some of your Brown Sugar
Sugar 
Oohooh

Now that'd be how the story goes
Brown Sugar got me open, now I want some more
Always down for a menage troi
But I think I'ma hit it solo
Hope my niggaz don't mind

Stick out my tongue and I'm bout 
ready to hit this pretty gritty
bitty with persistence
Yo, I don't think ya'll hear me

Brown Sugar babe I gets high off your love
I don't know how to behave
Sugar 
Oohooh
