I knew she was a feline
She moved with ease and grace
Her green eyes they held mystery

No emotion on her face
She speaks her lips are kissing
The air around her face
I don't always understand her
But I love her air and grace

The European female she is here
The European female's here
We'll be together for a thousand years
And do you really fear
That you might fall

I saw her in the Strasse
And in the Rue as well
Pursued her in the high street
She had me in her spell
