Ev'rything you say, ev'rything you do
Always seems to put me down - put me down

Is there something wrong, do I still belong?
Is it just a run-around? run-around?

Don't say he's not the reason why
'Cos when I lie awake
it's his name I hear you cry

Thought he'd left your mind
And that only time stood between your fantasy - fantasy

Guess I always knew he'd be haunting you
Stealing what you had from me - had for me

I can't stand here and let it die
Ev'ry step you take
I'll be there right by your side

'Cos it's breaking up my heart, feel like dying
Breaking up my heart, feel like crying
Tell him where to go show the man the door
'Cos ev'rything you do is breaking up my heart

I won't let you go baby never know
Can't you get it through your head? Through your head?

I won't set you free you belong to me
What he had for you is dead - love is dead

Love burns fire that never cools
Don't you know that love hurts people who break the rules?

'Cos it's breaking up my heart, feel like dying
Breaking up my heart, feel like crying
Tell him where to go show the man the door
'Cos ev'rything you do is breaking up my heart

I can't stand here and let it die
Ev'ry step you take
I'll be there right by your side

I won't let you go baby never know
Can't you get it through your head? Through your head?

'Cos it's breaking up my heart, feel like dying
Breaking up my heart, feel like crying
Tell him where to go show the man the door
'Cos ev'rything you do is breaking up my heart

Breaking up my heart
Breaking up my heart

Tell him where to go
Show the man the door

'Cos ev'rything you do is breaking, breaking

Breaking up my heart
Feel like dying

Breaking up my heart
Feel like crying.
