You're waisting your time
Coming round here
What got you to thinking
There was something new going on

You're waisting your time
Coming round here
What got you to thinking
I had a different song

Been lying awake all night
Trying to figure out
It's that old song
Keeps running around in my head

You're waisting your time
Coming round here

But what's good for me
Is not necessarely for the best
So play it for me

Sometimes it works
Sometimes it don't you know
Some days it hurts
Some days it feels real good

Sometimes it hurts
Sometimes it don't you know
Some days it works so good
I can't see my way home

Been climbing these old walls
Why don't they screamin
What a cheat you are
(oh I'm not you're mean)
Cos nothing else comes near me
You got this trick on the world

Me have the sharpest chisel
The keenest eye
It's just that old song
I only got the one

So play it for me

Sometimes it works
Sometimes it don't you know
Some days it hurts
Some days it feels real good

Sometimes it hurts
Sometimes it don't you know
Some days it works so good
I can't see my way home

I may have unscrewed the top
Just to hear that sound
I may poor little
Just to see the light shining thru

A little sip, but no more
Hey, you belong to me now
Don't you wander too far

So play it for me
And I'll play it for you
So play it for me
And I'll play it for you

Sometimes it works
Sometimes it don't you know
Some days it hurts
Some days it feels real good

Sometimes it hurts
Sometimes it don't you know
Some days it works so good

I'm waisting my time
Coming round here
What once burned so brightly
Is all but smoke in the air

You're waisting your time
Coming around here
What got you to thinking
I had a different song
