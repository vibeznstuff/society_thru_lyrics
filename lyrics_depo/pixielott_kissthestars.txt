Uuuh oooh uuuh oooh
We're on the rocket

Baby baby, we're on the rocket
Venus and Mars now, can't be apart now
Baby baby, put me in your pocket
We're on a mission, get in position

Put the plug in the socket, give me all your power
When you turn it on I can go for hours
Hit the switch, push the button, baby, then you'll see
We can have it all, baby, you and me

Kiss the stars tonight
You and me, oh, we will
Write our name in lights
They will see we're in love tonight

Love tonight, we're in love tonight
Love tonight, love tonight
We're in love tonight

Baby baby, we're on the rocket
Wherever we land you'll be my spaceman
Baby baby, we're supersonic
Now we together will last forever

Put the plug in the socket, give me all your power
When you turn it on I can go for hours
Hit the switch, push the button, baby, then you'll see
We can have it all, baby, you and me

Kiss the stars tonight
You and me, oh, we will
Write our name in lights
They will see we're in love tonight

Love tonight, we're in love tonight
Love tonight, love tonight
We're in love tonight

Put the plug in the socket, give me all your power
When you turn it on I can go for hours
Hit the switch, push the button, baby, then you'll see
We can have it all, baby, you and me

We We We can have it all, baby, you and me
We We We can have it all, baby, you and me

Kiss the stars tonight

Write our name in lights
