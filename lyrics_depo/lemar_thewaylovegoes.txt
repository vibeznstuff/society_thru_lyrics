oh whoa
oh oh
i never thought that i would ever love again
i might be wrong cos i can feel it happening
a little scared but i am not petrified
i love forever, i promise to stay by your side
heart broken, my first and never spoken
i waited to hear and i gave it a year
so i stopped holding on and then you came along
and then you came along
i'm gonna, i'm i'm i'm gonna

i hold you, i love you the best that i can
until you understand that i need you all in
and i can't dance alone cos the beat's just too slow
that's just the way love goes,
that's just the way love goes (uh uh)

i use to think that i would never get to be
in love again cos that was the only one for me
and now i feel that you have come and saved me
this heart of mine awoken by your smile
heart broken, my first and never spoken
i waited to here and i gave it a year
so i stopped holding on and then you came along
and then you came along
i'm gonna, i'm i'm i'm gonna

i hold you, i love you the best that i can
until you understand that i need you all in
and i can't dance alone cos the beat's just too slow
that's just the way love goes,
that's just the way love goes

i hold you, i love you the best that i can
until you understand that i need you all in
and i can't dance alone cos the beat's just too slow
that's just the way love goes,
that's just the way love goes

(gotta get strong, keep moving on) 

someone's coming to save me
someone's coming to save me
save me, save me, save me

i hold you, i love you the best that i can
until you understand that i need you all in
and i can't dance alone cos the beat's just too slow
that's just the way love goes,
that's just the way love goes

i hold you, i love you the best that i can
until you understand that i need you all in
and i can't dance alone cos the beat's just too slow
that's just the way love goes,
that's just the way love goes
