You got my attention baby, gone do what you do
Eviction notice, now you gone have to make a move
All this ice in my rolly, no wonder I play it cool
Ain't no 'I' in Team but
I got my eyes on you, I watch it bounce
When she walk, she lick her lips
When she talk
I throw her in that Bentley coup√© with the top off like Mardi Gras
All that cake, come get you some filling
Like a soap opera watch all my children
Hit it so long that she might lose feeling
With her legs in the air, she can walk on the ceiling
