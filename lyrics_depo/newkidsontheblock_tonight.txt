Remember when we said, girl, please don't go, 
and how I'd be loving you forever, 
taught you 'bout hangin' tough as long as you got the right stuff, 
didn't we, girls, ooh, didn't we, girls, aah? 

Well, I guess, it's a brandnew day after all 
every time we hear the curtain call, 
see the girls with the curls in the hair, 
the buttons and the pins and the loud fanfares. 
Tonight, tonight. 

Remember when we traveled round the world, 
there were a lot of people and girls, 
fan mail from everywhere showed us how you care, 
didn't it, girls, ooh, didn't it, girls, aah? 

Well, I guess... 

 Sounds good, hey fellas, let's do it, here we go. 
La-la-la-la-la-la tonight, la-la-la-la-la-la tonight. 
Tonight, tonight
