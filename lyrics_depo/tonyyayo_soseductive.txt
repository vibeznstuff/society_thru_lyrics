I put the g in g-unit baby I got game
Head to go good to go and I dont know your name
Is it the wheels on the hot car meals on the shock bar
Or you just wanna quickie with a rap star
Ladies tell the truth you know I'm cute 
But what really turns you on is the rims on my coupe
Before you jump in my whip and you get dropped off
You goin to the telly and you gettin popped off
I cant stop thinkin of the things you do
When your freakin me and I'm freakin you
I said the ice on my neck make the shortys stare
Baby let me fly you in my lair
Stop slow down baby if you hear this in the club shake and go down baby
Its past my curfew but parole don't know
Tear up the club dont call my p.o.

Yayos a don my car european 
You got mirrors in your pants cause I can see me in um

Tattoos and piercings and rings in your tongue
Shorty things like that will make my black ass cum
