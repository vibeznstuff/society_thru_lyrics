Leave us, I'm in heaven and I can't believe I'm watching you
When everything you float upon comes down to soon
Jesus hairdo
I mean we all live in America
And if everything you say is true, it's bad TV
And you shine like a star
And you shine like a genius
Fix our hands together

When I surf another wave comes right
Don't wanna cry, know what I need
Oh choose your words
Jesus hairdo
I mean we all live in America
And it's hard to know reality when you don't have a life

And you shine like a star
And you shine like a genius 

Sing your song whenever
Can't you see you're catchin' something I need
Get yourself together now you come and going out of phase

And you shine like a star
And you shine like a star
And you shine like a star
And you shine like a genius
