I drew the smile upon my face
I paved the road that would one day leave me lonely
No angel's too good to fall from grace
If she let's go of whatever keeps her holy

But I'm still here holding on so tight
To everything that I left behind
I don't care if the world is mine
Cause this is all I know

When I got my back up against the wall
Don't need no-one to rescue me
Cause I ain't waiting up for no miracle
Yeah tonight I'm running free
Into the Blue
Into the Blue
With nothing to lose
Into the Blue

I'm not ashamed of all my mistakes
Cause through the cold I still kept the fire burning
These memories that I can't erase
Always remind me I'm on an endless journey

But I'm still here holding on so tight
To everything that I left behind
I don't care if the world is mine
Cause this is all I know

When I got my back up against the wall
Don't need no-one to rescue me
Cause I ain't waiting up for no miracle
Yeah tonight I'm running free
Into the Blue
Into the Blue
With nothing to lose
Into the Blue
I'll go where nobody knows
Wherever the wind is blowing
Even if I'm alone

When I got my back up against the wall
Don't need no-one to rescue me
Cause I ain't waiting up for no miracle
Yeah tonight I'm running free
Into the Blue
Into the Blue
With nothing to lose
Into the Blue
