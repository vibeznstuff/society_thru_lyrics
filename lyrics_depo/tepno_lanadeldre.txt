Ever wondered why you met me
And fell in love over coffee
Well, you were looking so damn pretty
I forgot to breathe

Now I get choked up cause I'm running on a high, high
Everytime I die, you save me
Yeah I get caught up, but I'm going out tonight
You can't stop me from missing you

Cause, baby, you're the bestest
Baby, know that you can do anything
Anything you want on your check list
Don't you know that I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you

I know you got baggage lingering
But I know how to forgive you
What you did before, I can't change it
Just let me show you how to live

Now I get choked up cause I'm running on a high, high
Everytime I die, you save me
Yeah I get fucked up, cause I'm going out tonight
You can't stop me from missing you

Cause, baby, you're the bestest
Baby, know that you can do anything
Anything you want on your check list
Don't you know that I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
Don't you know that I believe in you
I believe in you

Yeah, I'll party with my friends tonight
I don't know what will happen
I, I'm so scared that the high could die
Cause we're living in a fantasy world
Yeah, I'll party with my friends tonight
I don't know what will happen
I, I'm so scared that the high could die

Cause, baby, you're the bestest
Baby, know that you can do anything
Anything you want on your check list
Don't you know that I believe in you
I believe in you
Don't you know that I believe in you
I believe in you
Don't you know that I believe in you
