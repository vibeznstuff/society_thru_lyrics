Now I've got nothing to look at 
And I've got no pain to deny 
And I've got nobody to bleed for 
And I've got no sun to pull down from the sky
But I'm saved, yeah, I'm saved 
And I don't understand it, I'm saved 

If mercy were to hold me closely 
And hide me in her place of no pain 
The angels would throw down the water 
They cried from one hundred million eyes

And I have a feeling that's growing 
Somewhere behind my sleeping mind 
Yeah, I'm saved, I'm saved 
Yeah, I don't know why, but I'm saved

When sunlight falls on your shoulder 
You look like a creature from Heaven 
You're holy when you open your eyes 
And look up inside that sheltering sky 

And you're an angel, I'll never betray you 
But I'll always be a lonely child 
Yeah, still I'm saved 
I'm saved 
Yeah, I don't deserve it 
But I'm saved
