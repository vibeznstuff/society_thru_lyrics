Well, everytime I feel you're coming round, you're going down
You hit the ground with every force, it makes no sense or sound
God bless your soul girl
Now you got the whole world
I'm on my way now
I'll get there somehow

Have you ever seen the light?
Don't you wonder where I hide?
I will live, then I will die
I will keep you on my mind

It's your eyes that make me smile, oh yeah oh yeah
Wasting time, hanging out, oh yeah oh yeah
These teenage years, no they don't last, oh yeah oh yeah
These teenage lips, they speak too fast, oh yeah oh yeah

I see the light that's shining from your eyes, blinding me
It's like I'm walking down your street again at seventeen

God bless your soul girl
They got the whole world
I'm on my way now
I'll get there somehow

Have you ever seen the light?
Don't you wonder where I hide?
I will live, then I will die
I will keep you on my mind

It's your eyes that make me smile, oh yeah oh yeah
Wasting time, hanging out, oh yeah oh yeah
These teenage years, no they don't last, oh yeah oh yeah
These teenage lips, they speak too fast, oh yeah oh yeah
