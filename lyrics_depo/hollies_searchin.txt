And if I have to climb a mountain, you know I will
And if I had to up-a on a Blueberry Hill
You know I'm gonna find that child you know I will

'Cause I've been searchin' oh Lord now searchin'
For goodness searchin' every way which way oh yeah

You know I'll bring her in someday
(I'm gonna find her)
I've been searchin'
Oh Lord now searchin'
For goodness searchin'
