God, I'm down here on my knees
'Cause it's the last place left to fall
Beggin' for another chance
If there's any chance at all
That You might still be listenin'
Lovin' and forgivin' guys like me

I've spent my whole life
Gettin' it all wrong
And I sure could use Your help
'Cause from now on

I want to be a good man
A do like I should man
I want to be the kind of man
The mirror likes to see

I want to be a strong man
And admit that I was wrong man
God, I'm asking You to come change me
Into the man I want to be

If there's anyway for her and me
To make another start
Could You see what You could do
To put some love back in her heart?
'Cause it goin' to take a miracle
After all I've done to really make her see

That I want to be a stay man
I want to be a brave man
I want to be the kind of man
She sees in her dreams

God, I want to be Your man
And I want to be her man
God, I only hope she still believes
In the man I want to be

Well, I know this late at night the talk is cheap
But Lord, don't give up on me

I want to be a givin' man
I want to really start livin', man
God, I'm asking You to come change me
Into the man I want to be
