Johnny the horse was kicked to death
He died for entertainment..

Would you believe he came out well
He had a bright inquiring mind
His family knew that he'd go far
If he applied his time

But he started out
Standing on corners
And talking out loud too loud
You see he couldn't believe in himself the world
Or anything he heard

It seems like a million years ago
That he left his life behind
The moment came for him to go
He said goodbye to his wife and child

He started out walking
Never looked back
It was too much pain
Between Glasgow and London
One hot summer he forgot his name

Can you remember his name?
Doo doodle eh do do

But he started out
Standing on corners
And talking out loud too loud
You see he couldn't believe in himself the world
Or anything he heard

Can you remember his name?
Doo doodle eh do do

Can you remember his name?
Doo doodle eh do do
Ditto Woooh!

Will you remember his name?
Doo doodle eh do do
Ditto Woooh!

He took his battered bones to Regents Park at sunset
