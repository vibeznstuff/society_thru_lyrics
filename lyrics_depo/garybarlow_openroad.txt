My life, is extraordinary bare
I fought the fear and chased the pain
My life, doesn't need to be explained
I chose to walk the line as one
Sometimes, as I live upon my island
Cut off from emotion and its pain
Ohhhh that's when, I am tempted by the waters
The waters that I can take me far away

So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Hoping someone somewhere needs me
So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Talking to the man who knows me
Yes he knows me
The man is me

My life, was once full of people's faces
Brought to me by love which isn't strange
Ohhhh my life, had the goodness of blue waters
A day's a day for all I used to say
Sometimes I can sit and cry my heart out
Drowning in my autocratic ways
Ohhhh that's when, I am tempted by the waters
Waters that can take me far away

So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Hoping someone somewhere needs me
So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Talking to the man who knows me
Yes he knows me
The man is me

My life, is now full of people's faces
Within the light of change I pulled away
Ohhhh my life, shows that no man is an island
I've exchanged the piece of life I cut away
Now you won't see me walking down that open road
I've found someone now who needs me
No you won't see me walking down that open road
I've found at last the man who knows me
Yes he knows me
And the man was me
The man was me
