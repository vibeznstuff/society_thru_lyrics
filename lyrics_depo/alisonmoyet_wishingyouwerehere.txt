I can't begin to tell you how it feels
It's a clear blue sky
Out here my heart so full it's fit to burst
Just counting the hours
Home, such a long way gone
How to share a day, here's my only way
Send myself to you
Wishing you were here

I can't begin to tell you where I've been
It's a world behind
And if we are to find our heaven here
We just have to look harder
Now I can see you
I never could before, now I want nothing more
When I close my eyes
Wishing you were here

Home such a long way gone
How to share a day, here's my only way
When I close my eyes
Wishing you were here

I can't begin to tell you how it feels
