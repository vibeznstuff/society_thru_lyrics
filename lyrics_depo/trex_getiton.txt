Well you're dirty and sweet
Clad in black
Don't look back
And I love you
You're dirty and sweet oh yea

Well you're slim and you're weak
You got the teeth
Of the Hydra upon you
You're dirty sweet
And you're my girl

Get It On
Bang a gong
Get It On

You're built like a car
You got a hubcap
Diamond star halo
You're built like a car
Oh yeah

You're an untamed youth
That's the truth
With your cloak full of eagles
You're dirty sweet
And you're my girl

Well you're windy and wild
You got the blues
I'm your shoes and your stockings
You're windy and wild
Oh yeah

You're built like a car
You got a hubcap
Diamond star halo
You're dirty sweet
And you're my girl
