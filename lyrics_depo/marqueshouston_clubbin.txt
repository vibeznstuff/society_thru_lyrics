Throw our hands up
All kinds of drinks are
Off in the cups
All of my thugs
Honies show me love
DJ playing the cuts

And her friend
One on the back and one on the front
Shaking it up, shaking it up
Mami don't break it
Taking it down, taking it down
I love the way you snake it
You got the best of me
Doing what you're doing
