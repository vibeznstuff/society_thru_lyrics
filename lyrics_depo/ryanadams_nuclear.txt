This is where the summer ends 
In a flash of pure destruction, no one wins 
Go nuclear. Nuclear. 
The violets in my eyelids goin' red 
Sentimental geek 
Shut up and go to sleep 

The calm, the beach and the remains 
Of the bathing suits and Porsches all in flames 
Go nuclear. Nuclear. 
When I saw her and the Yankees lost to the Braves 
Sentimental geek 
Shut up and go to sleep 

Give me an answer
