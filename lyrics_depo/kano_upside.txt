Everything's out of time,
We don't know which way
Which way is upside...

The only way is up, maybe
But I've been lost
No compass can't save me
So many demons out to slay me
If only, but I ain't gonna let them take me
Out of place, out of time
If I stay out of sight then I'll be out my mind
If I lose my head, I'll lose my focus
Well I lose my dough before I lose my soul
Askin me questions I don't know
I don't know if I'm comin' or I'm goin'
They think they know me but I don't know them
Isolated, hope I know some
On my Jack Jones, I hit the road jack,
But didn't come back, no more, no more
Well here I'm so high, you get shot down
My feet are on the ground but there ain't no floor
So now I'm falling

Everything's out of time,
And you don't know which way
Which way is upside...
Everything's out of time,
You don't know which way
You don't know which way is upside...

Everything's out of time,
And you don't know which way
Which way is upside...
Everything's out of time,
You don't know which way
You don't know which way is upside...
