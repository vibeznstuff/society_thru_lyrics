Yeah, uh! Get up now! Ow! Knock out this!

Super highwys, coast to coast, easy to get anywhere
On the transcontinental overload, just slide behind the wheel
How does it feel

When theres no destination-that's too far
And somewhere on the way, you might find out who you are

Livin' in America-eye to eye, station to station
Livin' in America-hand to hand,across the nation
Livin in America-got to have a celebration

Rock my soul

Smokestack, fatback,many miles of railroad track
All night radio, keep on runnin' through, your rock 'n' roll soul
All night diners, keep you 'wake, on black coffee, and a hard roll

You might have to walk the fine line,
you might take the hard line
But everybody's workin' overtime

Livin' in America-eye to eye, station to station
Livin' in America-hand to hand,across the nation
Livin in America-got to have a celebration

I live in America, help me out,
but I live in America,
wait a minute
You may not be looking for the promise land,
but you might find it anyway
Under one of those old familiar names
Like New Orleans (New Orleans) Detroit City (Detroit City), Dallas (Dallas), Pittsburg P.A. (Pittsburg P.A.) New York City (New York City)Kansas City (Kansas City)Atlanta (Atlanta) CHICAGO &amp; L.A.!

Livin in America-hit me
