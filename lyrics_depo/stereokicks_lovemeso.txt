Can we locate where we went wrong?
It's driving me crazy
It's tiring daily


And though she tries her best to stay strong
I'm feeling so guilty
Just wanna be guilt free


But, if you save me now
You can brave the doubt
You can pull me out
'Cos darling I have been


Crying on my bedroom floor, 
Wishing I was still in your arms
There I always seemed so sure
That you love me, that you love me so
Hey hey hey hey hey
That you love me so
Oh oh oh oh oh


Will love heal all of this pain
Maybe the scars but
Not a broken heart 'cos


A heart in pieces ain't the same
I told you, you have the ability to save


To save me now
If you can brave the doubt
You can pull me out
'Cos darling I have been


Crying on my bedroom floor
Wishing I was still in your arms
There I always seemed so sure
That you love me, that you love me so
Hey hey hey hey hey
That you love me so
Oh oh oh oh oh


I tried my best to understand
What makes a man
Is it the path where he began
Or the one where he stands now, now


'Cos I've been crying on my bedroom floor
Wishing I was still in your arms
Cos there I always seemed so sure

That you love me
That you love me so


Crying on my bedroom floor
Wishing I was still in your arms
There I always seemed so sure
That you love me, that you love me so
Hey hey hey hey hey
That you love me so
Oh oh oh oh oh
That you love me so
Hey hey hey hey hey
That you love me so
Oh oh oh oh oh
