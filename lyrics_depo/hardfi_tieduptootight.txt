Oh where I come from 
I just don't conform 
Get me out of here! 
Leave the boredom behind 
Wanna see those bright lights 
Get this thing in gear 
Yeah... 
So we'll ride in my car 
Follow the star 
Drive on into town 
With the stereo loud 
take the Great West Road out 
Nothing can bring me down 

You put your boots on... 
You put your boots on... 

And all boys and girls sing 
(Na na na na na na) 
Straight out of West London 
(Na na na na na na) 
Just like a loaded gun 
(Na na na na na na) 
The cognoscenti don't like us 
Don't like us! 
(Na na na na na na) 
We'll hit the strip tonight 
(Na na na na na na) 
Your eyes are burning so bright 
(Na na na na na na) 
Can't you feel the blood rush, baby 
Tied up too tight! 

Wa-ah-ah-ah-ahah 

Tell me can you feel it 
Feel the city breathing 
Feel its beating heart 
No superstition 
Just cold ambition 
It's time to make a mark 
Oh... 

You get your boots on... 
You get your boots on... 

And all boys and girls sing 
(Na na na na na na) 
Straight out of West London 
(Na na na na na na) 
Just like a loaded gun 
(Na na na na na na) 
The cognoscenti don't like us 
Don't like us! 
(Na na na na na na) 
We'll hit the strip tonight 
(Na na na na na na) 
Your eyes are burning so bright 
(Na na na na na na) 
Can't you feel the blood rush, baby 
Tied up too tight! 

Tied up too tight... 
Tied up too tight... 

And all boys and girls sing 
(Na na na na na na) 
Straight out of West London 
(Na na na na na na) 
Just like a loaded gun 
(Na na na na na na) 
The cognoscenti don't like us 
Don't like us! 
(Na na na na na na) 
We'll hit the strip tonight 
(Na na na na na na) 
Your eyes are burning so bright 
(Na na na na na na) 
Can't you feel the blood rush, baby 
Tied up too tight! 

Tied up too tight... 
Tied up too tight...
