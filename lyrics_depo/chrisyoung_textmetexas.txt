Who's in Houston that's keepin' you from talkin' to me
I ain't used to layin' down without the sound of your voice
Before I drift off to sleep, 
Girl, you got me climbin' the walls
if you can't find the time to call

Text me, Texas
Before you turn off your phone
I'm a wreck and I'm restless
Gotta feelin' that you're not alone
It's breakin' my heart and I'm startin' get the message
Come on and text me, Texas

I pray what you ain't sayin' don't mean what all my friends say it means
Maybe you can give me just a couple of lines I could read between
You could even tell me a lie
Anything to get me by

Come on and text me, Texas
Before you turn off your phone
I'ma  wreck and I'm restless
Gotta feelin' that you're not a lone
Yeah it's breakin' my heart and I'm startin' to get the message
Comone on, text me Texas

Whatever you can't tell me now
Baby, you could spell it out
Text me, Texas
Before you turn off your phone
I'm a wreck and restlesss
Got this feelin' you're not alone
It's breakin' my heart and I'm startin' to get the message
Come on and text me Texas
