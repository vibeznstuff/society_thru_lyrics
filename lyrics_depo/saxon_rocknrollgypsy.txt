Yaaahh

White Line fever
Takes me high
Another city
Another lie
Another town
Another face
Another woman to take your place
Catch the bullet
Ride the storm
Drive me crazy 'till the dawn
Like an eagle flying high
Look for freedom in the sky

She's a rock 'n roll gypsy
Don't go breaking my heart
She's a rock 'n roll gypsy
She's gonna tear me apart

Rollin' thunder
Movin' on
Another time
Another song
Another room
Another night
Another dream
Another fight
Keep on movin' down the line
Gypsy woman on my mind
Ask no questions tell no lies
See the answers in my eyes

She's a rock 'n roll gypsy
Don't go breaking my heart
She's a rock 'n roll gypsy
She's gonna tear me apart

Hey gypsy, uh, you're breakin' my heart, yeah
Tear me apart, uh, yeah

White Line fever
Takes me high
Another city
Another lie
Another town
Another face
Another woman to take your place
Catch the bullet
Ride the storm
Drive me crazy 'till the dawn
Like an eagle flying high
Look for freedom in the sky

She's a rock 'n roll gypsy
Don't go breaking my heart
She's a rock 'n roll gypsy
She's gonna tear me apart

She's a rock 'n roll gypsy
Don't go breaking my heart
She's a rock 'n roll gypsy
Yeah
