A dum dum a deedely dum uh huh huh a dum dum a deedely dum oh yeah
A dum dum a deedely dum
A music's sweet the lights are low playin' a song on the radio
Your ma's in the kitchen your pa's next door I wanna love you just a little bit more
Singing dum dum a deedely dum uh huh dum dum a deedely dum
Sing it out dum dum a deedely dum
Come on baby don't you be so shy you know that I love you let me tell you why
You got a heart I know that it's true I couldn't love you any more than I do
A singing dum dum a deedely dum oh yeah dum dum a deedely dum
One more time dum dum a deedely dum

Ah I want you with me all of the time tell me you love me and you'll be mine
There's so many things that we could do
So say the words and make my dreams come true
A singing dum dum...
