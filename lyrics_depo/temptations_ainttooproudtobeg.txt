I know you wanna leave me, 
but I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy, 
I don't mind coz' you mean that much to me

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go 

Now I heard a cryin' man, 
is half a man with no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you, 
I don't mind weepin' if it'll keep you by my side

Ain't to proud to beg, sweet darlin
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

If I have to sleep on your doorstep 
all night and day just to keep you from walkin' away 
let your friends laugh, even this I can stand 
cause I want to keep you any way I can

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin' 
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go 

Now I've gotta love so deep in the pit of my heart 
And each day it grows more and more 
I'm not ashamed to come and plead to you baby
If pleadin' keeps you from walkin' out that door

Ain't too proud to beg, you know it sweet darlin' 
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Baby, baby, baby, baby (sweet darling)
