You know that I would love to see you next year
I hope that I am still alive next year
You magnify the way I think about myself
Before you came I rarely thought about myself

Behind your veil I found the body underneath
Inside your head were things I'd never thought about

What's my view? Well, how am I supposed to know?
Write a review? Well, how objective can I be?

You know that I would love to see you in that dress
I hope that I will live to see you undress
The everyday is part of what consumes me
The hate i feel is part of what fuels me

I testify to having guilty feelings
I must confess, I'd like to be caught stealing
You know that I would love to see you in that dress
I hope that I will live to see you undress

What's my view? Well, how am I supposed to know?
Write a review? Well, how objective can I be?

I'd like to wait to see how things turn out
If you apply some pressure
I like  to wait to see how things turn out
If you apply some pressure!

What happens when you lose everything?
You just start again
You start all over again

What happens when you lose everything?
You just start again
You start all over again

I like  to wait to see how things turn out
If you apply some pressure
I like  to wait to see how things turn out
If you apply some pressure!

What happens when you lose everything?
You just start again
You start all over again

What happens when you lose everything?
You just start again
You start all over again!

What happens when you lose everything?
You just start again
You start all over again!

You know that I would love to see you next year
I hope that I am still alive next year
You know that I would love to see you in that dress
I hope that I will live to see you undress
