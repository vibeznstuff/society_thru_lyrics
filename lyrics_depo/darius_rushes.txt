She’s got a blind smile and a soft touch 
A cute little dimple when she laughs too much 
They say you fall hard when you meet her 
Such is her allure 
She’s got a quick wit and a fast tongue 
But she doesn’t seem to know that she’s the one 
They say she cheats charm when she whispers 
She’s devilishly pure 

You’d see if you knew her 
She doesn’t know 
But its time I told her so 

When I see your blushes 
From a compliment of mine it touches 
Something inside I’m getting rushes 
The adrenaline rushes 
And I'm fascinated 
That you really don’t know how to take it 
When I look at you that way you feel naked 
And I’m so into you 
I’m getting rushes 

She’s about five nine 
Got a sexy stride 
With long tanned legs that she shouldn’t hide 
With a fine air of innocence 
Nonchalance in every move 
She’s a sweet sensation tease temptation 
She looks good enough to eat 
She’s a fallen angel with a devilish streak 
And so they say 
Like with like will finally meet 

You’d see if you knew her 
She doesn’t know 
But its time I told her so 

When I see your blushes 
From a compliment of mine it touches 
Something inside I’m getting rushes 
The adrenaline rushes 
And I'm fascinated 
That you really don’t know how to take it 
When I look at you that way you feel naked 
And I’m so into you 
I’m getting rushes 

WhenI like it I want more 
And I like it and I want more 
And I like it and I want more 
Never felt it like this before 

It’s more than adrenaline rushes 
It’s the touch and the smell of skin rushes 
Some call it love at first sight 
I call it butterflies 

When I see your blushes 
From a compliment of mine it touches 
Something inside I’m getting rushes 
The adrenaline rushes 
And I'm fascinated 
That you really don’t know how to take it 
When I look at you that way you feel naked 
And I’m so into you 
I’m getting rushes
