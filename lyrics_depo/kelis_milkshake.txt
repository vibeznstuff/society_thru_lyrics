My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard,
And they're like
It's better than yours,
Damn right,
It's better than yours,
I can teach you,
But I have to charge

I know you want it,
The thing that makes me what the guys go crazy for.
They lose their minds,
The way I wind,
I think it's time


La, la, la, la, la,
Warm it up.
La, la, la, la, la,
The boys are waiting


My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard,
And they're like
It's better than yours,
Damn right,
It's better than yours,
I can teach you,
But I have to charge

I can see you're on it,
You want me to teach the techniques that freaks these boys,
It can't be bought,
Just know, thieves get caught,
Watch if you're smart


La, la, la, la, la,
Warm it up,
La, la, la, la, la,
The boys are waiting,


My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard,
And they're like
It's better than yours,
Damn right,
It's better than yours,
I can teach you,
But I have to charge

Oh, once you get involved,
Everyone will look this way
So, you must maintain your charm,
Same time maintain your halo,
Just get the perfect blend,
Plus what you have within,
Then next his eyes are squint,
Then he's picked up your scent


La, la, la, la, la,
Warm it up,
La, la, la, la, la,
The boys are waiting


My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard,
And they're like
It's better than yours,
Damn right,
It's better than yours,
I can teach you,
But I have to charge
