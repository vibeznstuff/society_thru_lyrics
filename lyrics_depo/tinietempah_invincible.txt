Tinie Tempah, Ishi, Kelly Rowland, Lets go
Invincible, invincible
Invincible, invincible
We're invincible

Ah, yeah they said we shouldn't, uh they said we wouldn't
Aah look where we are, we've done what they thought we couldn't
As bad as the odds were looking. Push yeah we kept on pushing
And every time I nearly hit the ground you were my cushion
There's evidence that proves that you were heaven sent
‘Cos when I needed resucin' you were there at my defence
Girl in you I find a friend you make me feel alive again
And I feel like the brightest star ‘cos you make me shine again

No matter where we are, no matter just how far our paths may lead
We don't need no shields ‘cos love is the armour that we need
We're invincible, Invincible
Invincible loves our protector
Invincible, Invincible
Invincible, we're invincible

Yeah, ah from the wildest water, ah to the highest mountains
Ah you and I forever even through the driest deserts
You lift me higher than ever, I feel as light as a feather
And when we're fightin' together, we can take on the weather
I will keep you warm through, every single storm you
Ever have to walk through, I will go before you
I will be the voice when you need someone to talk to
Please don't ever doubt me, let me reassure you

No matter where we are, no matter just how far our paths may lead
We don't need no shields ‘cos love is the armour that we need
We're invincible, Invincible
Invincible loves our protector
Invincible, Invincible
Invincible, we're invincible

It's you and I against the world
They can't stop us now
We've come too far
We've worked too hard
We're invincible
Forever…

No matter where we are, no matter just how far our paths may lead
We're invincible

We don't need no shields ‘cos love is the armour that we need
We're invincible, Invincible
Invincible loves our protector
Invincible, Invincible
Invincible, we're invincible
