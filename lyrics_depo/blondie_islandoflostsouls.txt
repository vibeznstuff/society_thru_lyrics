In Babylon
On the boulevard of broken dreams
My will power at the lowest ebb
Oh what can I do?
Oh buccaneer
Can ya help me put my truck in gear?
Can ya take me far away from here?
Save my soul from sin?

You wanna get away you've had it man
Nothing's going right
So come sit on the sands of the island
Island of Lost Souls

No luxuries, no no amenities
Too dull, your senses
Oh oh only primitive
"Hey hey really get away," is what he said

Where did he go?
I'm tired of waiting here for him
Where can he be?
He's not with me
Where did he go?
What will I do alone?
Why did he run, run away from me?

The sky is blue the sea is warm and clear
And golden sands are calling out to you inviting
Make a new man outa you

You can come for a while come with a friend
Forget about work start all over again
Let the real you through, here's what we do

Where did he go?
I'm tired of waiting here for him
Where can he be?
He's not with me
Where did he go?
What will I do alone?
Why did he run, run away from me?

No luxuries, no no amenities
Too dull, your senses
Oh oh only primitive
Hey hey really get away
Island of Lost Souls

Ayya ayya ayya Island of Lost Souls
