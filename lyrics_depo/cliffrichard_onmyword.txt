(On my word)
There will never be anyone but you child
(On my word)
No one else will ever do but you
(On my word)
I will never stray from your side
And someday you're gonna be my bride
(On my word)
They say I'm the cheatin' kind
They say looking close you'll find someone new
Som-someone new deep in my heart
But don't believe them 'cause I know
That deep inside they love you too, honey
(Repeat the 1st verse)

Umm, they say that I ain't no good
They say that I never would stand by you
Som-someday when you're deep in need
But don't believe them 'cause I know
That deep inside they love you too, honey
(Repeat the 1st verse again)
