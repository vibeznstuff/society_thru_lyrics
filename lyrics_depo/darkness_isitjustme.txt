I know that absence might 
Make the heart grow fonder
Or is it "out of sight
out of mind" I wonder
And do you yearn for me
When the nights grow cold
Til death us do part
To have and to hold
I wanna give you my love, my love, my love

But is it just me or am I all on my own again
You're up at John O'Groats, I'm down in Land's End
On you I depend

I see your face 
When I close my eyes
And there ain't no place
Like between your thighs
Don't want a life alone
All by myself
To honour and trust
In sickness and health
I wanna give you my love, my love, my love

But is it just me or am I all on my own again
You're at the Taj Mahal, I'm outside Big Ben
It's driving me round the bend

Forever and ever
And ever, amen
I wanna give u my love, my love, my love

But is it just me or am I all on my own again
You're in the Vatican, I'm in the Yemen
And it feels like the end
The end
