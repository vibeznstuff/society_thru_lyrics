She said I love you boy , I love you so
She said I love you baby, oh oh oh oh
She said I love you more than words can say
She said I love you ba-ay-ay-ay-by

So I said, what you're saying girl it can't be right
How can you be in love with me
We only just met tonight
So she said, boy I loved you from the start
When I first heard love goes down
Something started burning in my heart
I said stop this crazy talk
And leave right now and close the door

She said boy I love you boy I love you so
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh
She said I love you more than words can say
She said I love you ba-ay-ay-ay-by (yes you did)

So, now I'm up in the courts
Pleading my case from the witness box
Telling the judge and jury the same thing that I said to the cops
On the day that I got arrested
I'm innocent I protested
She just feels rejected
Had her heart broken by someone she's obsessed with
'Cause she likes the sound of my music
Which makes her a fan of my music
That's why love goes down not to lose it
'Cause she can't separate the man from the music
And I'm saying all this in the stand
While my girl cries tears in the galleries
Got bigger than I ever could have planned
Like that song by the Zutons Valerie
So the jury don't look like they're buying it
And it's making me nervous
Arms crossed, screw faced like I'm trying it
Their eyes fixed on me like I'm murderous
They wanna lock me up
And throw away the key
They wanna send me down

Even though I told them she...

She said I love you boy
I love you so
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh (yes you did)

She said I love you more than words can say
She said I love you ba-ay-ay-ay-by 

So I said why the hell you gotta treat me this way
You don't know what love is
You wouldn't do this if you did
Oh no no no no
