I don't believe I went too far
I said I was willing
She said she knew what my books did not
I thought she knew what's up

Past the mission
Behind the prison door
Past the mission
I once knew a hot girl
Past the mission
They're closing every hour
Past the mission
I smell the roses

She said they all think they know him
Well she knew him better
Everyone wanted something from him
I did too but I shut my mouth
He just gave me a smile

Past the mission
Behind the prison door
Past the mission
I once knew a hot girl
Past the mission
They're closing every hour
Past the mission
I smell the roses
Past the mission
And I smell the roses

Hey they found a body
Not sure it was his but they're using his name
And she gave him shelter
And somewhere I know she knows
Somethings only she knows

Past the mission
Behind the prison door
Past the mission
I once knew a hot girl
Past the mission
They're closing every hour
Past the mission
I smell the roses

Past the mission
Behind the prison door
Past the mission
I once knew a hot girl
Past the mission
They're closing every hour
Past the mission
I smell the roses

Past the mission
And I smell the roses
Past the mission
And I smell the roses
