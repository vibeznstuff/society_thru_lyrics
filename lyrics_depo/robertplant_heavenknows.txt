A brand new human being, razor sharp, all firm and tanned
All clean, all pure, with a thirty-second attention span
As the clock strikes twelve and we're ready for party games
You play blind man's buff and I'll play out charades

(Heaven knows) what kind of fool am I
(Heaven knows) why you take an eye for an eye
(Heaven knows) what comes over me
You were pumping iron as I was pumping irony

Now I find myself fully occupied and half alive
With your head, heart, arms and legs wrapped around my family pride
See the whites of their eyes then shoot
With all the romance of the Ton Ton Macoute

(Heaven knows) what kind of fool am I 

Nothing will show as we're shedding our clothes
But then I suppose, anything goes, anything goes
But then I suppose that anything, anything goes
(Heaven knows - heaven knows --)

(Heaven knows) what kind of fool am I
(Heaven knows) what comes over me
(Heaven knows) what kind of fool am I
Tell me please, please, please
(Heaven knows) what kind of fool am I --
