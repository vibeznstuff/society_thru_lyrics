She had an horror of rooms 
she was tired 
you can't hide beat 
When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home

She could've been a killer 
if she didn't walk the way she do, 
and she do
She opened strange doors
that we'd never close again

She began to wail jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean


Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

She asked me to stay 
and I stole her room
She asked for my love 
and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street
and she can't socialise
Well I love the little girl 
and I'll love her till the day she dies

She wails
Jimmy's guitar sound
jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean





Run, Run, Run
