When you touch me
I feel there's nothing you can do to turn me away
And I know that
In the past you've had bad luck so I should help you stay

You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed, it's you
You're all I've ever wanted
And loving you's the right thing to do
And I'll see it through

When I close my eyes
And think of you it takes me places that I've never seen
And the rain, it blows
You're brushing up against my skin to wash me clean

You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed - it's you
You're all I've ever wanted
And loving you's the right thing to do
And I'll see it through

I'll show you the love in my head
I'll show you the love that we had
I'll show you the love in my head
I'll show you the love that we had

You're all I ever wanted
You're all I've ever needed, it's you
You're all I've ever wanted
And loving you's the right thing to do

You're all I ever wanted
You're all I've ever needed, it's you
You're all I've ever wanted
And loving you's the right thing to do
And I'll see it through
