Yo Canibus man, whassup man?
I caught you on that cut with Wyclef man - you were boomin
But I caught these foul slouch-ass niggaz, youknowmean?
Talkin foul bout you the other night 
on the corner of the boulevard man - I wasn't with that 
but I ain't know you well enough to defend you though right?
But you seem like you got true game
But.. peep game man, they've been playin me all my life man
You know I won the title a couple of times, did right, youknowmean?
But they can't hurt us man, we gon' do it
Get up in this ring man put on these gloves
Let me show how to handle yourself man
You don't got nobody out there with you
I gots to show you man, get up in there move that head man
Come on to me man, but when you come man you gotta come for blood man
Come up to me man, come on bust that nigga whole man
Niggaz talkin that shit about you..

Hey Mike Tyson here speakin with the Canibus man over here
Yo Canibus your main objective out here is to do nuttin but
eat eat eat eat MC's, for lunch, breakfast
Hey man they been playin me all my life man
You know I won the title a couple of times did right
No but they can't hurt us man 
We gonna do it, get up in this ring man, put on these gloves 
Let me show you how to handle this yourself man


So I'ma let the world know the truth, you don't want me to shine
You studied my rhyme, then you laid your vocals after mine
That's a bitch move, somethin that a homo rapper would do
So when you say that you +Platinum+, you only droppin +Clue's+
I studied your background, read the book that you wrote
Researched your footnotes, bout how you used to sniff coke
Frontin like a drug-free role model, you disgust me
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
You walk around showin off your body cause it sells
Plus to avoid the fact that you ain't got skills
Mad at me cause I kick that shit real niggaz feel
While 99% of your fans wear high heels
From Ice-T to Kool Moe Dee to Jay-Z 
Now you wanna fuck with me?  You must be crazy!
You drippin with wack juice, and you can't get it off
You betta be prepard to finish what you start, nigga


Hey hey hey hey, you just hold it right there
(Yo, get off me man)
We got an illegal low blow on the fighter in the blue trunks
(Yo, yo get the fuck off me man)
If I see one more of those, you're outta here brotha
(Yo get out my way man, yo he started this shit)
You understand?  (Fuck you!)
You'll be disqualified  (I'll bite that nigga again!)
Stop bein a bitch  (Get the fuck off me man!)
We came to see a fight


Yo Canibus man you gotta hit harder than that man 
You don't want no bitch ass niggaz hangin out wit me man 
We're warriors man, when we go into battle
we come out, or don't come out at all


Yo
You better give me the respect that I deserve or I'ma take it by force
Blast you with a 45 colt, make you summersault
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
Before you wanted a war, now you wanna talk
It's about who strikes the hardest, not who strikes first
That's why I laugh when I hear that wack ass verse
That shit was the worse  rhyme I ever heard in my life
cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March 9th
God bless his soul rest in peace kid 
It's because of him now at least I know +What Beef+ is
It's not what I would call this (nah) see this is somethin different
A faggot nigga tryin ta make a livin offa dissin
Somebody that he gotta know is betta than him
but he feelin himself, cause he got more cheddar than him
Well lemme tell you somethin, you might got mo' cash then me
But you ain't got the skills to eat a nigga's ass like me
And if you really want to show off, we can get it on 
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
I'll let you kick a verse, fuck it, I'll let you kick em all
I'll even wait for the studio audience to applaud 
Now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Kick you in the groin, stick you for your Vanguard award
In front of your mom your 1st, 2nd and 3rd born
Make your wife get on the horn call Minister Farrakhan
So he could persuade me to squash it, I saw naw he started it
He forgot what a hardcore artist is
A hardcore artist is a dangerous man, such as myself
trained to run 20 miles in soft sand
On or off land, programmed to kick hundreds of bars off hand 
from a lost and forgotten land, you done did it man
You done spitted some wack shittit 
And probably thought that because it's been a minute I'll forget it
Fuck that, cause like Common and Cube I see +The Bitch In Yoo+
and I'ma make the world see it too, motherfucker


Ladies and gentelman, we have a new lyrical weight champion
By second round knock out, 3 minutes and 40 seconds Can-i-bus


Yo Canibus man, you movin like Mike Tyson Jr. man
You in and out and you're agile with you flow man
But dig right, you got you gotta eat man, that's your name Canibus 
Your whole agenda is to eat these niggaz man 
They have no business to be in the same stage with you
holdin the mic with you

But dig right...

But dig right...

But dig right...

But dig right...

Hey Mike Tyson here speakin with the Canibus man over here 
Yo Canibus your main objective out here is to do nuttin but
eat eat eat eat MC's for lunch, breakfast, dinner
That's your agenda baby
Your your agenda to to consume them
Their whole existance, they can't exist in your presence
The Canibus is here to rule forever
Mike Tyson, on the death
