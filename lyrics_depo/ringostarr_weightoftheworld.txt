Maybe your daddy never held you like you should,
Maybe your mama just held on the best she could.
Ev'ry soul has a secret,
Give it away or keep it,
But yesterday's gone so tell me why.

You carry the weight, the weight of the world,
It's breakin' you down on your back like a boulder.
Before it's too late, get rid of it, girl,
Get it off of your shoulder.
I know you've been used,
But you gotta lose the weight of the world.

Maybe i haven't always been there just for you,
Maybe i try but then i got my own life too.
Ev'ry heart has a hunger,
I'm not getting any younger,
I got all the crosses i can bear.

Don't gimme the weight, the weight of the world,
It's breakin' me down on my back like a boulder.
Before it's too late, get rid of it, girl,
Get it off of my shoulder.
You know i've been used,
And i gotta lose the weight of the world.

It all comes down to who you crucify.
You either kiss the future or the past goodbye,
We could fly so high.

But we carry the weight, the weight of the world,
It's breakin' us down on our backs like a boulder.
Before it's too late, get rid of it, girl,
Get it off of our shoulders.
We've all been used,
And we gotta lose the weight of the world.

It's takin' us down and the night's growin' colder,
Just blame it on fate, that was yesterday, girl.
And we're just growin' older.
We've all been used,
Now it's time to lose the weight of the world,
The weight of the world,
The weight of the world.
