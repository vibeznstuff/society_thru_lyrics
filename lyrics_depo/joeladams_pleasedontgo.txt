Mmhm...
Mmhm...

Nobody ever knows
Nobody ever sees
I left my soul
Back there now I'm too weak
Most nights I pray for you to come home
Praying to the Lord
Praying for my soul

Now please don't go
Most nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone
Now please don't go, oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't go

Mmhm...

Cause I don't ever want to know
Don't ever want to see things change
Cause when I'm living on my own
I wanna take it back and start again
Most nights I pray for you to come home
Praying to the Lord
Praying for my soul

Now please don't go
Most nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone
Now please don't go, oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't go

(Oh oh oh)
I sent so many messages you don't reply!
(Oh oh oh)
I gotta figure out what am I missing babe!
Singing now (Oh oh oh)
And I need you now, I need your love!
(Oh oh oh)

Now please don't go (Oh, no)
I said well most nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone
Now please don't go, oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't
Please don't go

Please don't go
Please don't go (Oh no)
Please don't go (Oh no)
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't go

Mmhm...
