Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves

So many people, so many problems
There in the pretty city lights
Where we've thrown it all away
Well, if life is here before my eyes
Then I find it hard to see

How the methods that were told to use
Are gonna make us free, until then I say

Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves

All through the mystery
All through the heartache
Shes got the only single thing
That Ill never throw away

Oh, if lightning strikes for a second time
Will you come and pull me through?
It's a battle that we all must make

So show me what to do
And you said

Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves

Well there's a feeling growing that is in this land
There's a soul that's burning and it's your hand
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves
Oh, so many people now, there's so many problems

There in the pretty city lights
Where we've thrown it all away
Well, if life is here before my eyes
Then I find it hard to see

How the methods that were told to use
Are gonna make us free

Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves

Well there's a feeling growing that is in this land
There's a soul thats burning and it's your hand

Everybody, weve got to fight for ourselves
