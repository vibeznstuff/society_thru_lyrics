baby please...keep tellin sweet lies

my mistake was lovin' you
much more than your lovin' me
even though you say that your heart is true
your words sound kind of empty
well i suspect but i don't dare
so cross your heart and darlin swear
like the moon and the stars you'll always be there

No, don't stop tellin' me sweet sweet lies
for you know my heart's gonna break
I guess that's why they say that love is blind
so keep on tellin' sweet lies

always seems like you're somewhere else
somewhere i just cannot reach
let's get back to the way love felt
cuz i don't wanna believe
that my intuitions right
say you'll stay and save my life
say the love in your heart will be burning bright

No, don't stop tellin' me sweet sweet lies
for you know my heart's gonna break
I guess that's why they say that love is blind

so keep on tellin' sweet lies
so if i'm a fool
if i'm lovin a lie
or if i've gotta swallow my pride
then it's a small sacrifice

No, don't stop tellin' me sweet sweet lies
for you know my heart's gonna break
I guess that's why they say that love is blind
so keep on tellin' sweet lies

so tell me baby(sweet lies)
there could be no other(sweet lies)
don't break my heart(sweet lies)
no, i don't wanna suffer
I just need you baby to make it alright
baby please, keep tellin sweet lies 
(keep tellin me sweet sweet lies)
swear it baby,(sweet lies)
swear you'll always be there (say that you'll be there)
save my life(sweet lies)
and promise me you'll do it (promise me you care)
say you'll stay and stay for all time
baby please, keep tellin' sweet lies

No, don't stop tellin' me sweet sweet lies
for you know my heart's gonna break
I guess that's why they say that love is blind
so keep on tellin' sweet lies
