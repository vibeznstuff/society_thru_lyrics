You've been with me a year to the day;
Three hundred and sixty five days watching me decay

We used to talk about girls who play guitars
We used to talk about plans in tiny bars

In the gaps between words are the things that really intrigue me.
It's the gasps and the sighs that say more about what's inside you

We used to climb aboard our high horse every time
We used to talk about boys with missing spines

It's her life and life worth living.
It's her life
It never struck her to pause for one minute 

The path of excess just led to boredom
You live you life with your mouth wide open…

It's her life and a life worth living.
It's her life
It never struck her to pause for one minute 

When you lie on my bed and you label me your friend.
Don't you know how much that hurts?

You could pretend and I wouldn't know
I could be who you wanted in the dark

She goes out
She gets drunk
She gets off
She goes home
She gives in – It's her life and a life worth living

We used to talk about girls who play guitars
