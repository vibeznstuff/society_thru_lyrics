I'm coming home to your loving heart
Till the one that I was
True way and broke apart

I want you I need you
A chance is all I'm asking now
I must get back to you so now
So I am coming home to you
'Cause I am nothing without you
May be you found somebody new
'Cause I'm still coming home to you

Please let me stay and forget your pride
Now my world is falling round
I got nowhere to hide

I want you I need you
I know it's true I made you cry
Then like a fool I said goodbye
Now I am coming home to you
Yes I am nothing without you
May be you found somebody new
But I'm still coming home to you
