Oh yeh Ooh ooh
Sunny honey girl, you're the only girl to love me
Sunny honey girl, such a funny girl to love me
And I know there's something in your smile
Makes our love and livin' so worthwhile

I'm a lucky guy to have you here, never shed a tear
Only when you're here so near to me, love and dear to me, I love you
Paradise could be nothing more to me, I love you
Can't imagine how I lived before
Nothing else could make me love you more

I'm a lucky guy to have you here, never shed a tear
Only when you're near, all my wrong is right
You always make the sun shine bright
Don't you ever go away
Baby, can't you hear me say I love you I love you

Can't imagine how I lived before
Nothing else could make me love you more
I'm a lucky guy to have you here, never shed a tear
No no

Sunny honey girl, you're the only girl to love me, can't you hear me
Sunny honey girl, you're the only girl to love me, oh yeah
Sunny honey girl, such a funny girl to love me, yeah yeah
Sunny honey girl, such a funny girl to love me, can't you hear me
Sunny honey girl, such a funny girl to love me, yeah yeah
Sunny honey girl, such a funny girl to love me
