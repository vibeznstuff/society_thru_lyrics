Oh, its a long time since I saw you
Well you know how time can fly
It seems like yesterday we were lovers 
Now we pass each other by

But if we're left alone tonight, don't ask me to hold you tight
I go weak
I go weak
I go weak
I go weak, weak in the presence of beauty

All my friends, keep asking
why I'm quiet while you're around?
They don't know I think I'm so lucky to stop myself from falling down

So later if you're on your own
Don't ask me to take you home
I go weak
I go weak
I go weak
I go weak, weak in the presence of beauty

Cause if were left alone tonight
I'll have no choice but to hold you tight
I go weak
I go weak 
I go weak
I go weak, weak in the presence of beauty

I go weak, darling, I love you
I go weak, theres no doubt about it
I go weak,
I go weak, weak in the presence of beauty
I go weak, you're my world
I go weak, I used to be your girl
I go weak 
I go weak
weak in the presence of beauty...
