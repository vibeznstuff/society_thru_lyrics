Meet me at the kissing gate
I know that's where you want to be
Meet me at that lonely place
Won't you just do this for me

Wow is a word that's not used
But that's how I felt
When I first met you
How did it start
This change of heart
There's one thing that you have to do

Meet me at the kissing gate
I know that's where you want to be
Meet me at that lonely place
Won't you just do this for me

Time and again we tried to make amends
We were making our way to a new brighter day
All we found
Was the end

Meet me at the kissing gate
I know that's where you want to be
Meet me at that lonely place
Won't you just do this for me
