We all need to feel secure and so middle-class
But I'm still waiting for next week's chemical blast
Don't go feelin' insecure, no feelin' sad
With an M-16, you'll feel the surge of you're American past

But are you afraid, you always said the world will never last
And Lola I'm not afraid, if you star-wipe all your past away
And the sun comes one more day

Lola, Lola, 
Will the world end? Me and you
Lola, Lola,
No we're never going to make it through

Can you take me back to that place where stars glow?
Comets swarm like fireflies outside your window  

But are you afraid, you always said the world will never last
And Lola I'm not afraid, if you star-wipe all your past away 
And the sun comes one more day

Lola, Lola, 
Will the world end? Me and you
Lola, Lola,
No we're never going to make it through
Lola...
