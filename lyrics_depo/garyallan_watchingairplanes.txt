Sittin Out here on the hood of this truck looking up 
At a caramel colored sunset sky 
Checkin my watch doin the math in my head 
Counting back words to when you said goodbye 
Well those runway lights are gettin brighter 

Im just sittin' out here watching airplanes 
Take off and fly 
Tryin to figure out which one you might be on 
And why you dont love me anymore 
Right now im sittin' out here watching airplanes 

I would've lied could've cried should've tried harder 
Done anything to make you stay 
I wonder what you'd do if you looked out your window 
Saw me runnin down the runway just like i was crazy 
That fence is too high so am i 

So I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes 
Take off and fly 
Tryin to figure out which one you might be on 
And why you don't love me anymore 
By now i know you're thirty thousand feet above me 
But a million miles away, a million miles away 
By now i know i outta act like you don't love me 

But im just sittin' out here watching airplanes 
Take off and fly 
Im just sittin' out here watching airplanes 
Take off and fly 
Tryin to figure out which one you might be on 
And why you don't love me anymore 

Yeah im just sittin' out here watching airplanes 
Go by, by, by 
Im just sittin' out here watching airplanes 
Baby bye, bye, bye
