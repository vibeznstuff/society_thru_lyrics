You can tell your girlfriends about me
It's about time to get rowdy
You know I wanna work that body
Come work it over here

You can be my brown-eyed beauty
And I bet you see right through me
You can do anything to me


You're so beautiful
Tonight anything is possible
And you know I just can't get enough
Of your love, so give it up


Got my eyes on you
Won't you bring that back to me
Got my eyes on you
You know where I'm gonna be
Got my eyes on you
And I see you checkin me
Got my eyes on you
And I like what I see

You can tell anyone about it
Show it off, no need to hide it
C'mon get a little excited
Excite it over here

Don't stop baby girl don't stop
I know you really like it when you're on top
Don't be shy jus give it up
C'mon girl!





Uh-oh-uh-oh
Your body's whining
Uh-oh-uh-oh
Bumpin and grindin'
Uh-oh-uh-oh
Stop and rewind it
