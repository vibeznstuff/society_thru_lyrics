She lived like she knew nothing lasts
Didn't care to look like anyone else
And she was beautiful, so beautiful
I still hear her laugh like she's here

Shower it down on all the young
It isn't so wrong to have such fun

Forever angel
I hope they love yo like we do
Forever angel
I'll be proud to be like you
Be like you
(I'll be proud to be like you)

Does the sun shine up at you when you are looking down?
Do you get along with the others around?

It's got to be better than before
You don't need to worry now you're gone

Forever angel
I hope they love yo like we do
Forever angel
I'll be proud to be like you
Be like you
Just like you

And when i go to sleep at night
I'll thank you for each blessed thing surrounding me
For every fall I'll ever break
Each moment`s breath I wanna taste
Confidence and conscience
Decadent extravagance
Never ending providence
For loving when I had the chance

Forever angel
I hope they love yo like we do
Forever angel
I'll be proud to be like you
Forever angel
I'll be proud to be like you
Forever angel
I'll be proud to be like you
