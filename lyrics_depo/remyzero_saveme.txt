I feel my wings have broken in your hands
I feel the words unspoken inside
And, they pull you under
And, I will give you anything you want, oh
You are all I wanted
All my dreams are fallen down
Crawlin' around and around and around

Somebody save me
Let your warm hands break right through it
Somebody save me
I don't care how you do it, just stay, stay
C'mon, I've been waiting for you

I see the world has folded in your heart
I feel the waves crash down inside
And, they pull me under
I would give you anything you want, oh
You are all I wanted
All my dreams have fallen down
Crawlin' around and around and around...

Somebody save me
Let your warm hands break right through it
Somebody save me
I don't care how you do it, just stay, stay
C'mon, I've been waiting for you

All my dreams are on the ground
Crawlin' around and around and around...

Somebody save me
Let your warm hands break right through
Somebody save me
I don't care how you do it just stay (stay with me)

I made this whole world shine for you
Just stay, stay
C'mon, I'm still waiting for you
