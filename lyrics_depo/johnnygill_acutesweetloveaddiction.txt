Gimme a low key brewski
I'm gonna be alright

Just like sugar (sugar)
Girl you're so sweet (sugar girl you're so sweet)
Lip smacking finger licking good
I wanna taste you

Like a fine wine
Smooth and intoxicating
Sip it slow never fast
Try to make it last as long as I can

I gotta have it
Fall in love
What do they call it when you can't get enough

A functional condition (and they call it...)
A cute sweet love addition (coming back for more)
Unconscious repetition (I can't get enough)
A cute sweet love addition

I'm hooked on your affection
Girl you're blowing my mind
When cupid shot his arrow
The target it found was my heart (oh yes it was)

Now I admit it I'm in love
So give it to me cos I can't get enough

A functional condition (and they call it...)
A cute sweet love addition (coming back for more)
Unconscious repetition (I can't get enough)
A cute sweet love addition
A functional condition (and they call it...)
A cute sweet love addition (over and over)
Unconscious repetition (I can't get enough)
A cute sweet love addition (It's called love addition yeah)

I need you darling yeah
Oh they've got to call it
Sweet love addiction

Now I admit it I'm in love
So give it to me cos I can't get enough

A functional condition (and they call it...)
A cute sweet love addition (coming back for more)
Unconscious repetition (I can't get enough)
A cute sweet love addition
A functional condition (and they call it...)
A cute sweet love addition (over and over)
Unconscious repetition (I can't get enough)
A cute sweet love addition (It's called love addition yeah)
