Tonight I'll hunt you down
Boy can you make me growl with the wild things on the prowl
Welcome to the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Welcome to the jungle

La la la
La di da di hands on my body
La la la oh just love me down
La la la
La di da di hands on my body
La la la oh just love me down

See them boy hit me up at the bar
Dark and smooth like a jaguar
Ask one time and I’ll make you my star
And you know you want to
If you wanna get deep in the club
Must refer up give me that jungle love
Only one winner one bad man time
And you know I want you

Tonight I'll hunt you down
Boy can you make me growl with the wild things on the prowl
Welcome to the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Welcome to the jungle

La la la
La di da di hands on my body
La la la oh just love me down
La la la
La di da di hands on my body
La la la oh just love me down

When you hungry then I'll be your ?
Come now help me with the kids’ cat purr
Top of the food chain, top of the world
And you know you want to
On your close unpredictable
One on one, done wild animal
Instant kicks and I can’t control
And you know I want you

Welcome to the jungle

Beat it up like Rocky, no ASAP
Cop game like 8 track
You want that I stay strapped
You knocked down, don't say that
Super faded, ready gone
She super bad, hardly wrong
Do your dance but they play my song
Excuse me shorty, you o-o-owned
True thrill and I'm sorry
Got two seats in this 'rari
For this pussy popping safari
So fuck it, let's party
It’s two cliques, one crew
Two twos and my two coops
Girl do you but let me too

Welcome to the jungle

Tonight I'll hunt you down
Boy can you make me growl with the wild things on the prowl
Welcome to the jungle
