Me, I'm like a pilot, G5 Jet I'm fly as shit
You cannot deny it, oh no, no-no, no-no
Bitches be on my dick, designer threads, I'm fly as shit
You cannot deny it, oh no, no-no, no-no
Better back up off me, bitch watch me ball (ball)
Better back up off me, bitch watch me ball (ball)
Better back up off me, bitch watch me ball (ball)
Better back up off me, bitch watch me ball (ball)


Nigga every law and every rule I break, feds trying to watch the moves I make
Everyday I get birthday cake, there's a hundred racks there in that safe
Hundred grands there on that plate, I ain't thinking 'bout catching no case
Thinking my safe house super safe, I zip zippers I don't tie no lace
Tom Ford, Y-S-L, nigga, run and tell, I'm fly as hell
Big Bentley, Mulsanne, no LP, just two songs
A-side, B-side, Rider gang, bitch, that's right
From N.O. to N.Y., I got shooters bitch, don't act cute and shit
We was born broke, no silver spoon, my niggas strapped, they super goons
These niggas here kinda soft, we get the bread, then fuck it off
Get more money, then fuck it off, make your bitch wan' suck me off
We ain't had shit, we learned to ball, them ghetto bitches they love us all




Shorty bounce it, and she clap that, slide down the pole, she's a super ho
That gold cuban, I jack that, you niggas know how this is supposed to go
I'm in the club with niggas, I clap that, that P90 I pack that
Your fuckin' head, I crack that, you wanna test me? Don't test me
Look, lover boy what're you trippin' for, niggas don't even want your ho
My nigga Ill fresh out the pen, you gonna make him go back again
Them bottles coming, we turnt up, them sparks burnin' now watch us shine
You do this shit once a year, we do this shit all the time
Now captain come and save her, get her from around this paper
She'll never be the same, I mean like everything will change
She cute blow a little cheese on her, get her ass shots, throw D's on her
Them shoes more than you think though, my bitch look like my bank roll
