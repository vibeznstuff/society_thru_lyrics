In the Still of the Night
I hear the wolf howl, honey
Sniffing around your door
In the Still of the Night
I feel my heart beating heavy
Telling me I gotta have more

In the shadow of night
I see the full moon rise
Telling me what's in store,
My heart start aching
My body start a shaking
And I can't take no more, no, no

Now I just wanna get close to you
An' taste your love so sweet
And I just wanna make love to you
Feel your body heat...

In the Still of the Night...
In the Still of the Night...
Over here baby...

In the heat of the day
I hang my head down low
And hide my face from the sun
Through the light of the day
Until the evening time
I'm waiting for the night to come

In the Still of the Night,
In the cool moonlight,
I feel my heart is aching
In the Still of the Night...

Tell me here baby

In the Still of the Night
I hear the wolf howl, honey
Sniffing around your door...
In the Still of the Night
I feel my heart beating heavy
Telling me I gotta have more...

Now I just wanna get close to you
An' taste your love so sweet
And I just wanna make love to you
Feel your body heat.

In the Still of the Night...

Still of the Night,
Still of the Night,
Still of the Night...
