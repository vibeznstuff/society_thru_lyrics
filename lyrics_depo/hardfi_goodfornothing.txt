The man who lives upstairs is on a mission
He just talk he never listen
He just talk he never listen
And he complains, complains about my love of music
Says it's too loud and he hates it
He don't like me cause I don't fit
I said I don't care, don't care what you think about me
Me and my friends at least we're happy
Tell me are you happy?

What are you good for?
Tell me what you're good for?
You're good for nothing hey, you're good for nothing

I'm good at wasting my time, fucking up my life
Hanging out, you know I'm the best waste of space about
I'm good at drinking too much, flicking ash in a paper cup
But I don't come cheap, I'm good for nothing I can't be beat
No no, good for nothing, no no
No, no, bueno para nada

Over at the nightclub, the club night doorman has a problem
Smart shoes only, I ain't got none
He says shoes or in you don't come
As if it's not right, I don't cause trouble and I don't fight
Just want fun dancing all night, all night

What are you good for?
Tell me what you're good for?
You're good for nothing hey, you're good for nothing

You keep me up all night, you know it's much too loud
Get a job, get a lot and what are you good for?

I'm good at wasting my time, fucking up my life
Hanging out, you know I'm the best waste of space about
I'm good at drinking too much, flicking ash in a paper cup
But I don't come cheap, I'm good for nothing I can't be beat
No no, good for nothing, no no
No, no, bueno para nada

Come down take a seat, life's hard but don't take it out on me
For your criticize
Take a long hard look at yourself
You're just a screw up like everyone else
And I feel bad for you

I'm good at wasting my time, fucking up my life
Hanging out, you know I'm the best waste of space about
I'm good at drinking too much, flicking ash in a paper cup
But I don't come cheap, I'm good for nothing I can't be beat

I'm good at wasting my time, fucking up my life
Hanging out, you know I'm the best waste of space about
I'm good at drinking too much, flicking ash in a paper cup
But I don't come cheap, I'm good for nothing I can't be beat
No no, good for nothing, no no
No, no, bueno para nada
