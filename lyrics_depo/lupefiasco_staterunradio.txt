You must be
A radio station
And who are we?
We must be
A number one song
Spinning all day long

And over again, and over again, and over again, and over again, and over again
And we don't win
When we call in
And nothing's free
Sounds to me
Like state run radio
State run radio 

We interrupt this broadcast,
To bring you this special message about the forecast,
The future's cloudy and it's raining on the poor class,
Road to peace is closed, heavy traffic on the war paths,

Love is balling on a budget,
The military's says it's gon' need more cash
To keep fighting for your gas
Keep us in our hoods and hope we never explore past,
Stay inside of your half,

Believe the lies you learned in your class,
That there's no treasure in your trash,
And a Sealy
Has the same feeling
That the floor has
And that's where you should stay,
This is what they play

And over again, and over again, and over again, and over again, and over again
And we don't win
When we call in
And nothing's free
Sounds to me
Like state run radio
State run radio 

You're now tuned into the weakest,
Frequency of fear,
Keep you locked right here,
And hope you never leave this,
Never be a leader,
Think inside the box, and follow all procedures,

Never ever believe that you will never need this,
Hit up all your friends and tell them to repeat this,
Hi, you're on the air,
Now what you wanna hear?
Well we ain't got the truth, but how about a remix?

Different is never good, good is only what we pick,
You ain't got a hit, unless it sounds like these did,
Not too smart you will be a superstar,
And if you dumb it some,
Maybe you could be number one

And over again, and over again, and over again, and over again, and over again
And we don't win
When we call in
And nothing's free
Sounds to me
Like state run radio
State run radio 

So beware what's on the airwaves
And be more aware of what's not getting airplay
Independent spirit, you can barely hear what they're saying
Truth ain't getting on like shampoo on an airplane

Propaganda's everywhere, constantly on replay
All the hits, all the time, back to back on relay
We're really where it lives
Make 'em hear the records we play
Build your own station
Become your own DJs

You must be
A radio station,
And who are we?
We must be
A number one song spinning all day long,
And you put me in daily rotation,
You're on the air,
We know you're scared,
But we don't care,
We'll play this here,

And over again, and over again, and over again, and over again, and over again
And we don't win
When we call in
And nothing's free
Sounds to me
Like state run radio
