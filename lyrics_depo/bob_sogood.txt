Drinking a German beer (aha) with a Cuban cigar (ever)
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad (aha)
Great head on her shoulders (ha), she probably studied abroad (aha)
She transferred to Harvard (yup) from King's College in March (ever)
She says that I'm her favorite cause she admires the art
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars (bars)
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect
S-smile and pack your bags real good baby
Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while


Girl tell me how you feel, oh
What your fantasy, oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up
Be my senorita
We ain't gotta rush
Just take it slow
You'll be in the high life
Soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want, it's yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You say you never had it so good
La la-la la-la la-laaa
You never had it so good
La la-la la-la la-laaa


Suffering from first class cabin fever
Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza
Still lean to the left like the tower out in Pisa
I'm feeling single baby
I could use a feature
Swagger like Caesar, I'll get you a visa
We can go to Italy, and maybe see the Coliseum
I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa
Smile, so pack your bags real good baby
Cause you'll be gone for a while




Well I been feeling singular
How about let's make it plural (plural)
Spin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go (we'll go)
We'll hit up Europe, (Europe) yep, and spend some Euros (Euros)
So maybe visit Berlin (Berlin) and the walls with the murals (murals)
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo (Virgo)
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot (Merlot)
A Ros√©, a Burgundy, travel like turbo
Brush up on your Espanol
We're Barcelona bound
Smile, so pack your bags real good baby
Cause you'll be gone for a while




La la-la la-la la-laaa
You never had it so good
La la-la la-la la-laaa
