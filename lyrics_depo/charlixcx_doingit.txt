We're staying all night
We never slow down
I think we better do it like we're doing it now
It's been a long time
Since we've been around
So come on, let's keep doing it like we're doing it
Doing it like we're doing it


Waited so long just to be here
And now we're bringing this back to life, yeah, we're bringing this back to life
Want you to know how I miss ya
And now I got you right by my side, yeah, I got you right by my side


Locked inside my veins you're in my blood, in my blood
And we united forevermore


We're staying all night
We never slow down
I think we better do it like we're doing it now
It's been a long time
Since we've been around
So come on, let's keep doing it like we're doing it
Doing it like we're doing it now


Keep doing it like we're doing it
Doing it like we're doing it


Friends like a team in a circle
We're together we're so alive, yeah, together we're so alive
Joy like a jewel let it sparkle
Know that I got your back for life, yeah, I got your back for life






Keep doing it like we're doing it
Doing it like we're doing it now




All night long
We dancing to this song
We doing it, we going on and on, on and on
All night long
We dancing to this song
We doing it, we going on and on, on and on



(All night long
We dancing to this song)



(All night long
We dancing to this song)
