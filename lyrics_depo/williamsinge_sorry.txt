You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness

I know you know that I
Made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I Mean
Maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me oh let me
Redeem oh redeem oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances, ohhh

Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh no
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Girl I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say sorry now?

Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body,
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Girl I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say sorry now?

Oh yeah
I'm sorry
Oh baby
