I feel a presence in the air
Of something special, something rare

Love in your eyes is the reason why
Holding the secret as certain prize
Love in your eyes is the flame that makes
Me feel so warm inside!

Were silent wishes to be heard
It would express that single word

Love in your eyes is the reason why
Holding the secret as certain prize
Love in your eyes is the flame that makes
Me feel so warm inside!

It suddenly takes you by the hand
And leads you through the promised land
Is this really happening to me and you?

A thousand words could not describe
This precious way I feel alive

Love in your eyes is the reason why
Holding the secret as certain prize
Love in your eyes is the flame that makes
Me feel so warm inside!

Build your love on a strong foundation
And you will feel the sweet sensation
Build your love on a strong foundation
And you will feel the sweet sensation
Build your love on a strong foundation
And you will feel the sweet sensation
Build your love on a strong foundation
And you will feel the sweet sensation
