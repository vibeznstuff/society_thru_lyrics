Time's gonna make you a man someday
And you won't want to go out and play with your friends
You'll just sit at home and watch News At Ten
And the pubs'll be closed and you won't have been with your friends

And he picks up the paper and appears to be quite serious
And you smile at him and agree 'cus he's your old man
But still I can't hear you (still I can't hear you)
You make no sense to me
Still I can't hear you (still I can't hear you)
When the time comes I'll disagree with your policy... with your policy

When you get home from work about half past six
You've been working real hard and you feel real sick with the whole world
And your dinner's in the oven and it's all dried up
And your mom don't like it 'cus you messed her up for the evening

So you pick up a paper and appear to be quite serious
And you smile at him and agree 'cus he's your old man
But still I can't hear you (still I can't hear you)
You make no sense to me
Still I can't hear you (still I can't hear you)
When the time comes I'll disagree with your policy... your policy...

With your policy... your policy

Time's gonna make you a man someday
And you won't want to go out and play
You'll just sit at home and watch News At Ten
And the pubs'll be closed and you won't have been
When you get home from work about half past six
You've been working real hard and you feel real sick
And your dinner's in the oven and it's all dried up
And your mom don't like it 'cus you messed her up
But you don't wanna sit tight you don't wanna play it cool
You don't wanna whole life like the first day at school
And I wanna fight wars and I wanna die young
So don't keep saying like father like son
I can't hear you (still I can't hear you)
You make no sense to me
I can't hear you (still I can't hear you)
When the time comes I'll disagree 
But still I can't hear you (I can't hear...)
I said you make no sense to a boy like me
I can't hear you (still I can't hear you)
Still I can't hear you (still I can't hear you)
Still I can't hear you (still I can't hear you)
Still I can't hear you (still I can't hear you)
