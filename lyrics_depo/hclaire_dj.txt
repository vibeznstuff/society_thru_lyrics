Another Friday night
And the weekend's just begun
Everyone's dressin' up
'Cos it's time to have some fun

Tonight
Live all your fantasies
Tonight
Play it on and on

DJ
Show us what you got
Keep our bodies movin'
Turn the music up
DJ
Don't you ever stop
You know what to play
To make this party
Rock all night

Everyone's feelin' good
Smiling faces everywhere
So if you're in the mood
Put your hands up in the air

Tonight
Live all your fantasies
Tonight
Play it on and on
