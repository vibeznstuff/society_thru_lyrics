When somebody leaves you
That's the time to cry
When you know you're lonely
You're not the one and only
Who will cry

When your heart is broken
That's the time to cry
When you know she's left you
You'll know that she has left you
So you can cry

Happiness is what I long for
Loneliness is why I cry
For you have made my heart a slave
And now it's up to you

When somebody leaves you
That's the time to cry
When you know she's left you
You'll know that she has left you
So you can cry
