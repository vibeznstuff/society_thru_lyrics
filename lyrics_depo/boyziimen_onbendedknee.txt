Darling, I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl, it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
If you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be?
Oh, God, give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee

I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
I know that I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes to face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be?
Oh, God, give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee

I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee


Baby, I'm sorry
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done
Please come back home, girl
I know you put all your trust in me
I'm sorry I let you down
Please forgive me

I'm gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers
The blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go

You gotta believe in the spirit of love
It'll heal all things
It won't hurt any more
No, I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees
Begging you please
Come home

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be?
Oh, God, give me the reason
I'm down on bendedâ€”down on bended knee

Wanna build a new life
Just you and me
Gonna make you my wife
Raise a family

I'll never walk again 'til you come back to me
I'm down on bended knees.
