Yes, ah, yo


Yeah, ready for the summer, girl, your hair looks killa
See your batty getting bigger but your waist looks slimmer
And I hope I'm still with you when your hair get thinner
I ain't gotta work it out, I know I'm onto a winner
And I love it when I see you sing a song in the mirror
When you play your favourite records where there ain't no filler
Chicky-cha, chicky-chicky-cha, Sade, J Dilla
Now I'm on the right track, from the train to the limo
Now we're on the right track (right track), yeah
Used to know me back in college, now I got it like that
Could have got the side track, now I'm back on my feet
If I hadn't achieved, would you pack up and leave?
Now you scratchin' on me like we're Adam and Eve
Playing remix to Ignition in the back of the Jeep, ah
She like the hook but she don't know the verse
She know I love her even if I never say the words


You were something I can't replace
You made my heart work
You make me stronger
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go
You were something I can't replace
You made my heart work
You make me stronger
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go


Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go


Livin' in a bubble, we ain't struggling in life
Ready for your trouble and a couple of fights
Why don't you stay over here and keep me up in the night
And when you comin' in here, I'll do you just like you like
Girl I'm ready for your loving, girl I keep on falling
You my lucky number that I keep on calling
Wanna never let me go, she said she fed up of touring
Because I kiss her in the night and then I leave in the morning
I tell her one, already know she the one
She's 22, we in Le Fountain Blu
And when she's free, you know she call on me
And then I make her take it off and pull it all on me
Playing in the sheets, don't sleep tonight
Playing R. Kelly "I Believe I Can Fly", yeah
She like the hook but she don't know the verse
She know I love her even if I never say the words


You were something I can't replace
You made my heart work
You make me stronger
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go
You were something I can't replace
You made my heart work
You make me stronger
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go


Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go


Oi my size, I see you're quite shy
Guess I'm a sucker for those nice eyes
I ain't in it for the money or the fame
I'm the one that all the honeys couldn't tame, yo I change
(You make my heart work, you make me stronger)
You know I changed
(This thing we have, it can't be bought or sold, now)


You were something I can't replace
You made my heart work
You make me stronger
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go
You were something I can't replace
You made my heart work
You make me stronger
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go


Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go
