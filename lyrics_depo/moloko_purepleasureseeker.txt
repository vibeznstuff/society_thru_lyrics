Yeah
Gotta get me some
Gotta get me instant gratification
Gimme new kicks
Won't you show me new tricks
Without the ramifications
Give it a try, don't be shy
Well, you know you might like it
Never been too keen a timekeeper
But I'm a pure new pleasure seeker

All the way from Venus
Invading from Mars
Don't let that come between us
It's written in the stars
Save me from fading afraid
The tears of a fool on parade
Quietly turn into stone
Make me flesh and bone

Well come on
Oh, you know that you want it now
Well come on, yeah
You know that you want it and how

Stimulation in body and cell
For the good and misguided
Desperation, I'm under your spell
Misunderstood and derided
Speculation, they kiss and they tell
Misjudged and misquoted
Fell into the abyss
I must have wanted this
Another myth exploded

Take a weight off your mind
Trust the voice of experience
I tell you little white lies
Viva indifference
Stoke up the fire
I'm all you require
They won't set you alight
Come and live your desire

Come make me whole
Body and soul x8

Well come on
Oh, you know that you want it now
Well come on, yeah
You know that you want it and how

Gimme new kicks
I wanna go deeper
Never been too keen a timekeeper
Show me new tricks
You can get me on the beeper
I'm a pure new pleasure seeker

Would be a crime against passion
Not to itch that itch
Oh, don't ask how it happened
This is it
All we have ever wanted 
All we will ever need
Nothing can take his place
It's written all over your face

Yeah
You know that you want it now
Come on
Oh, you know that you want it and how
Come on
Yeah you know that you want it now
Come on
Oh, you know that you want it and how

Gimme new kicks
I wanna go deeper
Never been to keen a timekeeper
Show me new tricks
You get me on the beeper
I'm a pure new pleasure seeker
Never been too keen a timekeeper...

Come make me whole
Body and soul

Come on!
