That’s enough, I can’t take anymore
I’m right out of vision, I’m right out of hope
You stood me up, just knock me down
What’s on your conscience? nothing happens in my town

I’ll do graffiti if you sing to me in French
What are we doing here if romance isn’t dead?
Mind your mouth as you walk with me
Take care ooh oh as you cross the street

Well that’s enough, I’ve had it up to here
I’ve lost my vision, I’ve lost my hope
You woke me up, just hand me down
You’ve lost your conscience, cause nothing happens in my town

I’ll do graffiti if you sing to me in French
What are we doing here if romance isn’t dead?
Stay in line on the foreign trip
Waking up and I need a lift

I’ll do graffiti if you sing to me in French
What are we doing here if romance isn’t dead?
Stay in line on the foreign trip
Waking up and I need a lift down to…

That’s enough
