Up all night, sleep all day
Up all night, sleep all day

When evening comes I am alive
I love to prowl around in the streets
It's the moonlight that controls my mind
Now I've got the power to speak

Awake from dusk to dawn
Watching the city lights
Stars are shining down
They'll be shining down
On you and I
And when the morning comes
And I'll hold you
'Til the morning light

Everybody sing it now

Up all night, sleep all day
Up all night, sleep all day
That's right

Driving down the boulevard
All alone
The neon signs
Are calling your name
Find me in the corner
Having the time of my life
You'd think you'd wanna do the same

Awake from dusk to dawn
Watching the city lights
Stars are shining down
They'll be shining down
On you and I
And when the morning comes
And I'll hold you
'Til the morning light

Everybody sing it now

Up all night, sleep all day
Up all night, sleep all day
That's right
Up all night, sleep all day
Come on, Come on
Up all night
Ah, maybe we can just stay up
Twenty four hours a day

Awake from dusk to dawn
Watching the city lights
Stars are shining down
They'll be shining down
On you and I
And when the morning comes
And I'll hold you
'Til the morning light
Everybody sing it now

Up all night, sleep all day
Up all night, sleep all day
Come on, Come on
Up all night, sleep all day
That's right
Up all night, sleep all day
Up all night.
