Charades, pop skill
Water hyacinth, named by a poet
Imitation of life
Like a koi in a frozen pond
Like a goldfish in a bowl
I don't want to hear you cry

That's sugarcane that tasted good
That's cinnamon, that's Hollywood
C'mon, c'mon no one can see you try

You want the greatest thing
The greatest thing since bread came sliced
You've got it all, you've got it sized
Like a Friday fashion show teenager
Freezing in the corner
Trying to look like you don't try

That's sugarcane that tasted good
That's cinnamon, that's Hollywood
C'mon, c'mon no one can see you try

No one can see you cry

That sugar cane that tasted good
That freezing rain, that's what you could
C'mon, c'mon on no one can see you cry

This sugarcane
This lemonade
This hurricane, I'm not afraid
C'mon, c'mon no one can see me cry

This lightning storm
This tidal wave
This avalanche, I'm not afraid
C'mon, c'mon no one can see me cry

That sugar cane that tasted good
That's who you are, that's what you could
C'mon, c'mon on no one can see you cry

That sugar cane that tasted good
That's who you are, that's what you could
C'mon, c'mon on no one can see you cry
