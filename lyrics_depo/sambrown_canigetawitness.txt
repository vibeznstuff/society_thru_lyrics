Listen everybody
Especially you boys
It is right to be left alone
When the one you love is never home

I love too hard
My friends sometimes say
But I believe I believe
That a man should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside
To see him treat me so unkind

Somebody somewhere
Tell him it's unfair
Can I get a witness
Can I get a witness
Can I get a witness
Somebody

Is it right to be trated so bad
When you've given everything you've had
Even tossin' in sleep cause I
Haven't see my baby all week
Now all you boys agree
That this ain't the way love's supposed to be
Let me hear you let me hear you say yeah

Up early in the morning with him on my mind
Just to find out all night that I've been cryin'
But I believe that a woman's a man's best friend
And I'm gonna stick by him till the very end
'cause he's caused so much misery
That I forget how love's supposed to be

Somebody somewhere
Tell him it's unfair
Can I get a witness
Can I get a witness
Can I get a witness
I want a witness
Witness witness
