I can still taste you on my lips, your tenderness
You always gave me something
The way you made me feel before you left
See you're jadin' me, dazin' me
And I just wasn't ready, cash on, walk out on today
Oh Lord, still you always keep me wantin'

Oh, let me go, you let me down
When I'm with you, I'm broken now
You made me feel, you understand
With you I won't be, a better man
(You give me the demon to love you)
Got too many reasons why I can't
(You give me the demon in me)

Only this time it seems, they've always been
The safest place for hiding
People love to say, I'm blind to see
I can face it, I will stay
And you know I ever speak it
And that's all I ever need
Oh Lord, still you always keep me wantin'

Oh, let me go, you let me down
When I'm with you, I'm broken now
You made me feel, you understand
With you I won't be, a better man
(You give me the demon to love you)
Got too many reasons why I can't
(You give me the demon in me)

Oh Lord, you picked me up so many times
But know you just break my soul
No more, I tried to stop loving you
But I don't really have control
Oh Lord, no matter how hard I try
I always end up on this road
Oh, still you always keep me wantin'

Oh, let me go, you let me down
When I'm with you, I'm broken now
You made me feel, you understand
With you I won't be, a better man
(You give me the demon to love you)
Got too many reasons why I can't
(You give me the demon in me)

(You give me the demon to love you)
Every single reasons why I'm back
(You give me the demon in me)
