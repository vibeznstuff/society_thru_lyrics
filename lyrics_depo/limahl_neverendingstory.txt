Turn around
Look at what you see
In her face
The mirror of your dreams

Make believe I'm everywhere
Given in the light
Written on the pages
Is the answer to a never ending story
Ahahah ahahah ahahah...

Reach the stars
Fly a fantasy
Dream a dream
And what you see will be

Rhymes that keep their secrets
Will unfold behind the clouds
And there upon a rainbow
Is the answer to a never ending story
Ahahah ahahah ahahah...

Story
Ahahah ahahah ahahah...

Show no fear
For she may fade away
In your hand
The birth of a new day

Rhymes that keep their secrets
Will unfold behind the clouds
And there upon a rainbow
Is the answer to a never ending story
Ahahah ahahah ahahah...

Never ending story
Ahahah ahahah ahahah...
Never ending story
Ahahah ahahah ahahah...
Never ending story
Ahahah ahahah ahahah...
