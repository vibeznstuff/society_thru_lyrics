Yes I am, yes I am a master.
I had you, bad man.
Little love, little love caster
Palm of my hand.

I wish that I had, I wish that I had've told you then
Where my kindness ends.

I will take you home, I will take you home and then
Our lovespell will end

You are new to me
You are new to me
And I can't seem to say
"I'd like you to stay"

Yes I am, yes I am a master
I had you, bad man
Little love, little love caster

They might know you best, they might know you best and love you most
But I would breathe you in
I would breathe you in and be your ghost.

I saw a lady dance yesterday
She was easily swayed
I cannot be tossed and turned in this way
I'm not your tiny dancer

I can't seem to say,
"I'd like you to stay."

I'm no one's tiny dancer.
