I'll leave it alone
Back off if you want
I know that it's wrong
But you know where you belong
It's easy to see
You don't buy what you read
This light that you need
It's here fading with me

I'm waiting for you darling
I'm waiting for the word
I'm waiting for you darling
Just say it and nothing will stand in my way

I'll leave you alone
Pack my bags and go home
There's something you should know
I wont stop til' you know that I mean it

I'm waiting for you darling
I'm waiting for the word
I'm waiting for you darling
Just say it and nothing will stand in my way
Nothing will stand in my way

Waiting for you darling
Waiting for the word
Waiting for you darling
Just say it and nothing will stand in my way

Waiting for you darling
Waiting for the word
Waiting for you darling
Just say it and nothing will stand in my way
