Marianne, must I live for only yesterday?
Now you've gone away, Marianne

Marianne, all I have is just a memory
Of what you mean to me, Marianne

Here am I without a love to my name
I shall be just following my lonely heart
Endlessly must I be calling your name
Telling you I am waiting
Won't you please come back again?

Marianne, must I wait until eternity?
Please come back to me, Marianne

Here am I without a love to my name
I shall be just following my lonely heart
Endlessly must I be calling your name
Telling you I am waiting
Won't you please come back again?

Marianne, must I wait until eternity?
Please come back to me, Marianne
Please come back to me, Marianne
