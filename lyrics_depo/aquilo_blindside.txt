Blindside
How did you creep up on my blindside?
I'm not the one who wants this
Aren't I the one who gets to leave?
Almost
You almost made me think I want this
I look at the way we live
And only see things I'd given up
And I could say that I'm broken, but I'm not
And I could fake that I'm hurtin', but I know that's all you want from me
Tell you I love you, but I don't
Can I stay the night?
Just let me stay the night

Hold on, you should've said something in the moment
I know I let it go cold before
But didn't you just leave me with your silence?
And I could say that I'm broken, but I'm not
And I could fake that I'm hurtin', but I know that's all you want from me
Say that I love you, but I don't
Can I stay the night?
Just let me stay the night

Always trouble in the way
Always trouble in the way
Oh, why does it have to be today?
But I could say that I'm broken, but I'm not
And I could fake that I'm hurtin', but I know
That's all you want from me
Tell you I love you, but I don't
Can I stay the night?
Just let me stay the night
