You say it's not what you do,
It's what you're thinking of
Well I think its just an excuse,
It's what you put across

'Cos I don't wanna be the one,
Only overjoyed
I don't wanna be the one,
Making all the noise
Yeah, I don't wanna be the one

So make sure you're thinking it through,
You've let me down again
Offer me something I know you really meant

'Cos I don't wanna be the one,
Only overjoyed
I don't wanna be the one,
Making all the noise
Yeah, I don't wanna be the one, hey

What you gonna offer now?

I don't wanna be the one,
Only overjoyed
I don't wanna be the one,
Making all the noise
Yeah, I don't wanna be the one, hey

What you gonna offer now?

What you gonna offer now?

This was not my idea,
Don't you keep me waiting

What you gonna offer now?
