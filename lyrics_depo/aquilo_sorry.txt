The note you wrote upon a shell
The frozen air in Silverdale
My heart is breaking by the shore
And I couldn't give you anymore

And I'm still shaking
And crawling back again
And all my brothers
And all my sisters are gone

I'm sorry that I let you go
I'm sorry that I cared
I'm sorry that the feeling shows
But I just wasn't there
I'm reminded of the fool I was
I cut you off and fucked it up again
I'm sorry that I let you go
I'm sorry that I cared

This pillow case it smells of you
And time itself it stops to prove
That for a moment nothings changed
And everything just stays the same

And I'm still shaking
And crawling back again
And all my brothers
And all my sisters are gone

I'm sorry that I let you go
I'm sorry that I cared
I'm sorry that the feeling shows
But I just wasn't there
I'm reminded of the fool I was
I cut you off and fucked it up again
I'm sorry that I let you go
I'm sorry that I cared

I left the light on
So you could see me from the dark
But then it blinded us
And left us where we are

I'm sorry that I let you go
I'm sorry that I cared
I'm sorry that the feeling shows
but i just wasn't there
I'm reminded of the fool I was
I cut you off and fucked it up again
I'm sorry that I let you go
I'm sorry that I cared
