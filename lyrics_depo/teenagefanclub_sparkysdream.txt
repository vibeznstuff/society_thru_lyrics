If she lived in space, man
I'd build a plane
Out of luck so beam me up
To hear her talking again

She painted pictures
That never dried
Always tried to keep the feeling alive

Need a crystal ball to see her in the morning
And magic eyes to read between the lines.
I took a wrong direction
From a shooting star
In a love dimension
Fading fast from taking this too far

That summer feeling is gonna fly
Always try and keep the feeling inside

Need a crystal ball to see her in the morning
And magic eyes to read between the lines
I took a wrong direction
From a shooting star
In a love dimension
Fading fast from taking this to far

Got a magic ball to see her in the morning
Crystal eyes to read between the lines
Got a magic ball to see her in the morning
Crystal eyes to read between the lines
