You can forget what love was wearing
When it walked out your front door
Where you fell down to your knees
And you can forget the kind of suitcase
That was packed out on the sidewalk
While you cried there beggin' please
But love remembers

You can lie and tell yourself
You're over it and someone else will take love's place
And this is for the best
You can lie in that bed
In a stranger's arms reachin' for comfort
Close your eyes and still get no rest

Cause love remembers
The smell of a summer day
Lying in a hammock over fresh cut grass
And the promise of forever
Yeah love remembers
The sound of the pouring rain
Beatin' down on the top of a car
On the side of the road
Where it couldn't wait
Yeah love remembers

You might convince yourself
There's shelter in a bottle
And for a while there it might numb the pain
But when it hits you, then it hits you
That love's still gone and you'll be wishin'
That you'd poured it down the drain
'Cause love remembers

The taste of cotton candy lip gloss
On the lips of a long kiss
And the plans they made together
Yeah love remembers
To feel the fingertips
Running through soakin' wet hair
On the bank after a midnight swim
Yeah love remembers



Yeah love remembers
The smell of a summer day
Lying in a hammock over fresh cut grass
And the promise of forever
Love remembers
The sound of the pouring rain
Beatin' down on the top of a car
On the side of the road
Where it couldn't wait
Yeah love remembers

Love remembers
(Love remembers)
(The sound of the pouring rain)
Beatin' down on the top of a car
(On the side of the road)
(Where it couldn't wait)
