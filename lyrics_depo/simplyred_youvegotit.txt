This impossible power
A strength that I can't see
There's no way
That I can let you go
Why did I mistake sex
For another sense
Then wanted someone else
To try to tell you no

I think you understand
Oh that you've got it
I try hard but I can't
Oh do without it

I think you understand
That you've got it

This impossible power
Has broken into me
And stolen all the sense
That I had before
Why did I just take 
And never understand
The love you've given me
Could've learnt me more

I think you understand
Oh that you've got it
I try hard but I can't
Oh do without it

I think you understand
That you've got it

What made you think
That I'd be true to you
I needed to 
Prove it to myself
That I could let you go
What made you think that
I'd be a fool for you
You knew that I was lying
There was something
I was hiding

I think you understand
Oh that you've got it
Well I try hard but I can't
Oh do without it
