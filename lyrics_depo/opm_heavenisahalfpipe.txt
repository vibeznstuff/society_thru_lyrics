If I die before I wake
at least in heaven I can skate
'cause right now on earth I can't do jack
without the man up on my back

now heaven would be a DJ
spinning dub all night long
and heaven would just kicking back
with Jesus packing my bong
and if you don't believe in Jesus and Muhammad or Buddha too
and while the world is warring
just sit back and laugh at you singing..

If I die before I wake
at least in heaven I can skate
'cause right now on earth I can't do jack
without the man up on my back

now most people think of heaven
they see those pearly gates
but I looked a little closer
and there's a sign says "do not skate"
so if you wanna come to my heaven
well we're all gonna have a ball
and everyone u know is welcome
'cause we got no gates or walls singing.

If I die before I wake
at least in heaven I can skate
'cause right now on earth I can't do shit
without the man fucking with it

and then I got to the gate
pulled a list that I'd been calling fate
I'm sorry friend you can't come in
you gotta a list here that doesn't end
you're mad 'cause I smoke dope
you teaching any classes in how to cope
I'll find a place to rest my head
I rather be alone now that I'm dead
like Christian hossoi way back in 87
we'll be busting Christ air's until we get to heaven
think I really care that I miss my biology
got my education in stale fishology
with all your rules you got to chill
I'm gonna twist out Mike McGill
I'm gonna twist out 'cause I got the skills
I'm gonna twist out 'cause I got the skills... got the skills got the skills

heaven is a halfpipe..
heaven is a halfpipe..

If I die before I wake
at least in heaven I can skate
'cause right now on earth I can't do jack
without the man up on my back

If I die before I wake
at least in heaven I can skate
'cause right now on earth I can't do shit
without the man fucking with it
