Say my name like it's the last time
Live today like it's the last night
We want to cry but we know it's alright
Cause I'm with you and you're with me
Butterflies, butterflies..we were meant to fly
You and I, you and I..colors in the sky
We could rule the world someday, somehow
But we'll never be as bright as we are now

We're standing in a light that won't fade
Tomorrow's coming but this won't change
'Cause some days stay gold forever
The memory of being here with you
Is one I'm gonna take my life through
'Cause some days stay gold forever

Promise me you'll stay the way you are
Keep the fire alive and stay young at heart
When the storm feels like it could blow you out remember
you got me and I got you..cause we are, butterflies, butterflies..we were meant to fly
You and I, you and I..colors in the sky
When the innocence is dead and gone
These will be the times we look back on

We're standing in a light that won't fade
Tomorrow's coming but this won't change
'Cause some days stay gold forever
The memory of being here with you
Is one I'm gonna take my life through
'Cause some days stay gold forever

I won't, I won't let your memory go cause your colors they burn so bright
Who knows, who knows what tomorrow will hold but I know that we'll be alright

'Cause we're butterflies, butterflies..we were meant to fly
You and I, you and I..colors in the sky
We could rule the world someday, somehow but we'll never be as bright as we are now

We're standing in a light that won't fade
Tomorrow's coming but this won't change
'Cause some days stay gold forever
The memory of being here with you
Is one I'm gonna take my life through
'Cause some days stay gold forever
