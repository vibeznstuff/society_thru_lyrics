Go down for the one
Bump up on the two
Go down for the funk game
Go down for the one
Bump up on the two
Go down for the funk game

I recall the rise and fall
In the funky little jams we used to throw down to
Am I coming through?
For those who know the two-step flow
You'll remember how we used to love the 'tic tac toe'
It was strong but slow

Let it overcome you
'Til you got no choice to
Tune in to what we wanna see you do

Go down for the one
Bump up on the two
Go down for the funk game (oh get down)
Go down for the one
Bump up on the two
Go down for the funk game

As you chill, recall the thrill of intoxicaing moves that make you feel so high
Like the Butterfly
And I would doubt you'd be without the best of what the DJ had to play to you
Like he oughtta do

Let it overcome you
'Til you got no choice to
Tune in to what we wanna see you do

Go down for the one
Bump up on the two
Go down for the funk game (get down, get down)
Go down for the one
Bump up on the two
Go down for the funk game

Move your body to the funk!
(Just move it)
Move your body to the funk!
(Oh won't you get down?)
Move your body to the funk!
Move your body to the funk!
Move your body to the funk!
Move your body to the funk!
(Just move it)
Move your body to the funk!
(Move it, move it, move it, move it up for me)
Move your body to the funk!

Let it overcome you (Let it overcome you)
'Til you got no choice to ('Til you got no choice to)
Tune in to what we wanna see you do (sing it, sing it, oh won't you go and get down)
