I'm not the sort of person..
who falls in and quickly out of love
but to you I gave my affection right from the start.
If I have a lover who loves me 
how could I break such a heart,
you can still get my attention right from the start.


Why do you come here when you know I got troubles enough?
Why do you call me when you know I cant answer the phone?
Make me lie when I don't want to 
and make someone else some kind of unknowing fool
You make me stay when I should not.
Are you so strong or is the weakness in me?

Why do you come here and pretend to be just passing by?
But I need to see you
and I need to hold you...tightly
Baby


Feelin' guilty... worried.
Waking from tormented sleep
this old love has me bound but the new love cuts deep.
If I choose now, I lose out
cause one of us has to fall
I need you and you aren't here
