Heh... not again...
Oh... this ain't supposed to happen to me...


Keep rockin', and keep knockin'
Whether you Louis Vuitton-ed up or Reebok-in'
You see the hate, that they're servin' on a platter
So what we gon' have - dessert or disaster?


I never thought I'd... be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
And you came in... and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race
But I... already won first place

I never thought I'd... fall for you as hard as I did
(As hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinkin' about our life, our house and kids (yeah)
Every morning I look at you and smile
Cause boy you came around and you knocked me down... knocked me down


Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down)


I've never thought I
Would hear myself say (ooh)
Ya'll go ahead
I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today (Kick it with my girl today)
I used to be commander and chief
Of my pimp ship flyin' high (flyin' high)
'Til I met this pretty little missile who shot me out the sky (oh shot me out the sky)

(Hey) 'til now I'm crashing, I don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back, and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would baby if I could
Miss independent (oh, to the fullest), the load never to much, she helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight


Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down)


Tell me now can you make it past your caspers
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
To seem to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that, always kept you laughin'
We, were never meant to be baby we just happened
So please, don't mess up the trick... hey young world I'm the new slick rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let the moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess have asked someone that's only average
For advice
O.M.G, you listen to that, bitch?
Woe is me
Baby this is tragic
Cause we had it, we was magic

I was flyin', now I'm crashin'
This is bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm a ask him


So I gotta put the good with the bad, happy and the sad
So I'll bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh Cause, I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
Whoa, whoa
I'll admit it, I I was scared to answer loves call
Whoa, whoa
And if it hits better make it worth the fall

(When it comes around)


Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down)

Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love come and knocks you down (oh)

Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down (yeah)
