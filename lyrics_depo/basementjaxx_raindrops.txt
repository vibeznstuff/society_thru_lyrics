In a desert you're standing
A silhouette in motion
On the glory afternoons in June I need you

Just like raindrops, just like raindrops
You feel so good upon my lips
Just like raindrops, just like raindrops
Even though you're a million miles away

There's a space out there
And then when we can move
On the glory afternoons in June I need you

Just like raindrops, just like raindrops
You feel so good upon my lips
Just like raindrops, just like raindrops
Even though you're a million miles away

Just like raindrops, just like raindrops
You feel so good upon my lips
Just like raindrops, just like raindrops
Even though you're a million miles away

You taste so great on my lips
You taste so good on my lips
Your moisture drips upon my lips
Just like a waterfall straight through the heart of me

Raindrops, raindrops
Raindrops, raindrops
Raindrops, raindrops
Raindrops, raindrops

Just like raindrops, just like raindrops
You'll feel so good upon my lips
Just like raindrops, just like raindrops
Even though you're a million miles away

Just like raindrops, just like raindrops
You'll feel so good upon my lips
Just like raindrops, just like raindrops
Even though you're a million miles away

When I want you I'll follow you
I'll follow you
When I want you I'll follow you
I'll follow you
