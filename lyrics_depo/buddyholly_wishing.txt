Wishing that I could see you every day
Wishing that I could steal your heart away

Dreaming of the time I can hold you tight
Wishing that the time would come tonight

I been hopin' all along things would turn out right
If I could find a wishing star then I would spend the ni-i-ight

Wishing that I could see you every day
Wishing that I could steal your heart away

I been hopin' all along things would turn out right
If I could find a wishing star then I would spend the ni-i-ight

Wishing that I could see you every day
Wishing that I could steal your heart away
