Oh is he more, too much more, than a pretty face?
It's so strange the way he talking - it's a disgrace

Well I know I've been out of style
For a short while
But I don't care how cold you are
I'm coming home soon
I'm gonna make you a star
Yeah yeah

Well he say he's into his music but I don't believe it
He just doesn't seem to understand the rock media

Well I know I'm not super hip 
And I'm liable to take a slip
But I don't care how cold you are
I'm coming home soon
I'm gonna make you a star
Yeah yeah

We gonna make you a star 
We gonna make you a star

Oh is he more, too much more, than a pretty face?
(I don't think so)
It's so strange the way he talking - it's a disgrace

Well I know I've been out of style
For a short while
But you see I don't care how cold you are
I'm coming home soon
I'm gonna make you a star
Yeah yeah

We gonna make you a star 
We gonna make you a star
We gonna make you a star 
We gonna make you a star
