This world, my heart, my soul.
Things that I don't know.
The icicles they grow.
They never let me go.
Scars are left as proof.
But tears they soak on through.
Things I've done.
My young.
My unforgivable youth.


We land on the horizon. The passion in their eyes then.
What they think of islands and much more in their size.
Bountiful and plentiful and resource to provide them.
Supplies slim. Morale when so heavily inside them.
Now steadily declining. 
Return is not an option as necessity denies them. 
With this they choose to dive in.
Now along the shore and so aware of their arriving.
Other children of this land prepare to share in their surviving.
A pigeontry of feathers stands his majesty with treasure.
Now the material things that kings that could never last forever.
But secrets of the spirit world and how to live in harmony together.
Unbenounced to him his head would be the first that they would sever.
And stuck up on a pike up along the beach. 
Kept up as a warning to the rest to turn away from their beliefs.
And so began it here. And for 500 years. 
Torture, Terror, Fear til they nearly disappear.


This world, my heart, my soul.
Things that I don't know.
The icicles they grow.
They never let me go.
Scars are left as proof.
But tears they soak on through.
Things I've done.
My young.
My unforgivable youth.


Ways and means from mistreated human beings. 
A slave labor force provides wealth to the machine. 
And helps the new regime establish and expand. 
Using manifest destiny to siphon off the land. 
From native caretakers who can barely understand. 
"How can land be owned by another man. Warns one can not steal what was given as a gift. Is the sky owned by birds and the rivers owned by fish." 
But the lesson when the heated, for the sake of what's not needed. 
You kill but do not eat it. 
The excessive and elitists don't repair it when they leave it. 
The forests's were cleared, the factories were built. 
And your mistakes will be repeated by your future generation doomed to pay for your mistreatments. 
Foolishness and flaws, greed and needs and disagreement. 
And you rushed to have the most, from the day you left your boats. 
You'll starve but never die. In a world of hungry ghosts.


This world, my heart, my soul.
Things that I don't know.
The icicles they grow.
They never let me go.
Scars are left as proof.
But tears they soak on through.
Things I've done.
My young.
My unforgivable youth.


As archaeologists dig in the deserts of the east.
Appeared 100 meters wide and 100 meters deep.
They discover ancient cars on even older streets.
And a city well preserved and most likely at it's peak.
A culture so advanced, and by condition of the teeth.
They can tell that they was civil, not barbaric in the least.
A society at peace. With liberty and justice for all.
Neatly carved in what seems to be a wall.
They would doubt that there was any starvation at all.
That they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved.
From the sheer amount of paper, most likely used for trade.
Everything's so organized. They had to be well behaved.
Assumed they had clean energy, but took to no enemies.
Very honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies.
Religions kinda complex. Kinda hard to figure out.
And this must be the temple.
This White. House
