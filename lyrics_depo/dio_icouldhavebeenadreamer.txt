Running with the wolf pack feel like I'm never coming back and everytime there's sunshine I'm blind yeah
I am everybody and everyone that I know is me everyone that I know won't see
I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star I could have been a dreamer yeah
I'm another number and you know the numbers must agree but everytime the wind blows I can't fly why
We take away tomorrow and never see the end of today lock it up and send it away forever
I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star 
I could have been a dreamer 'cause dreams are what we are I could have been a dreamer oh oh
Running with the wolf pack feel like I'm never coming back but maybe that was sunshine that I saw
I've heard about a rainbow I've heard it makes you crazy I think I'm goin' crazy crazy 'cause I see
I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star
I could have been a dreamer 'cause dreams are what we are
I could have been a dreamer I could have been the one to fly
I always could have been a dreamer 'cause dreamers never die no
I could have been a dreamer dreamer I could have been a dreamer dreamer
I could have been a dreamer dreamer I could have been a dreamer
