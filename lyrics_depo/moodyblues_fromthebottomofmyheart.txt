I can't be with you anymore
In love with you
You gotta realise, baby
There ain't nowhere
I can find love anymore
That I can criticize 
From the bottom of my heart
I really love you
Yes, I do now
It didn't take too long
To be sure
From the bottom of my heart
I really do

Things you do I admire
And I'm in love with you
You gotta realise, baby
Everyday our love grows
Higher and higher
I find no fault in you
I can criticize 
From the bottom of my heart
I really love you
Yes, I do now
It didn't take too long to be sure
From the bottom of my heart
I really do

Now don't you ever go away
Without you
I just don't know
Where to start
I'm asking you to stay
And, baby, you know I've said it
From the bottom of my heart

It's so good
That I know
And I'm in love with you
All you gotta realise baby
As day by day
Our love will grow
I find no fault in you
I can criticize 
From the bottom of my heart
I really love you
Yes, I do now
It didn't take too long
To be sure
From the bottom of my heart
I really do
Oh, I really do love you
I really do love you, babe
