Make our escape, you're my own Papillon
The worlds turns too fast
Feel love before it's gone

It kicks like a sleep twitch!
My Papillon, feel love when it's shone
It kicks like a sleep twitch!

Darling, just don't put down your guns yet,
if there really was a God here,
he'd have raised a hand by now.
Darling, you were born but you will die here,
that's quite enough for me too,
we'll find our own way home somehow.

No sense of doubt, for what you can achieve,
I'd help you out, I've seen the life you wish to leave
Well it kicks like a sleep twitch!
You will choke, choke on the air you try to breathe.
It kicks like a sleep twitch!

Darling, just don't put down your guns yet,
if there really was a God here,
he'd have raised a hand by now.
Darling, you're born, get old, and die here.
well that's quite enough for me too,
we'll find our own way home somehow, Papillon!

It kicks like a sleep twitch!
It kicks like a sleep twitch!

Darling, now just don't put down your guns yet,
if there really was a God here,
he'd have raised a hand by now!
Darling, you're born, get old, and die here.
well that's quite enough for me,
we'll find our own way home somehow.
It kicks like a sleep twitch!
Aah 
It kicks like a sleep twitch!
