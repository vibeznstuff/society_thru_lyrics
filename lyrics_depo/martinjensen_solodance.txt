In the faded light
You touch my body
I can feel your hands
On my skin
Think you've got me right
Where you want me
But you're just in my way

I came to party on my own
Don't need nobody in my song
I get down to the beat
I lose control

Yeah, oh, I go
So-solo

Boy, you can cool it down
Not here to fool around
Just wanna dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
I know you want me
But I don't care, baby
Just wanna dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance

Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance

In the shade of night
You're moving closer
We're on our way to cross the line
Think you got me right
Where you want me
But it's all in your mind

I came to party on my own
Don't need nobody in my song
I get down to the beat
I lose control

Yeah, oh, I go
So-solo

Boy, you can cool it down
Not here to fool around
Just wanna dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
I know you want me
But I don't care, baby
Just wanna dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance

Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
