Where they go
That we shall cherish and that I wrestle
Don't want to be like the dust that settles
This empire of nothing
I find that I'm king of all these empty homes
That are ruled by my own flaws
But you can't be an old fire
If you are burning with a new flame
So remember that, you are never a forgotten name
Cause I know a land called the land of the living
It's the world beyond those curtains where we learned to play
I hear the voices of my childhood singing it's the world beyond those doorways
Where we use to play
Cause every moment
Is a chance to define what you want to become
You're not a slave to things you've done
Be brave and be bold
Be childish and old it's the same old story
Every life needs a hope of glory
But you can't be an old fire
If your burning with a new flame
So remember that, you are never a forgotten name
Cause I know a land called the land of the living
It's the world beyond those curtains where we learned to play
I hear the voices of my childhood singing it's the world beyond those doorways
Where we use to play
I was born to be free, you were born to free me
I was born to be free, you were born to free me
I was born to be free, you were born to free me
I was born to be free, you were born to free me
Cause I know a land called the land of the living
It's the world beyond those curtains where we learned to play
I hear the voices of my childhood singing it's the world beyond those doorways
Where we use to play
I know a land called the land of the living
It's the world beyond those curtains where we learned to play
Oh we'll go back, we'll go back to the beginning
And well pick up on the trails of forgotten ways
