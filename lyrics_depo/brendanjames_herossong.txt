Here I am
In the desert again
A compass and a weapon
A lost American
I started out with a simple plan
And a locket in my hand
But the sun so unforgiving
And the wind so hard to stand

Fall out, fall out
With the rest of your brothers
With the rest of your sisters
Heroes on the line
Carry out what your leader says
For what his leader says
Is that his leader says
This is right for the people

No one will ever understand why
Thousands of beautiful, healthy,
Young statues must fall
Smoke and explosions surround me
A flood of hate, it drowns me
I cannot live this way
No I cannot live

Doubt and confusion
They find me
They run up right behind me
I cannot die this way
No, I cannot die this way

In the water, in the sand
Is the blood of a culture
Is the blood of an ancient people
In whose holy war I stand
I hear the world like a cannon roar
Say I can't win this war
I promise them this is
Not what I signed up for

No one will ever understand why
Thousands of beautiful, healthy,
Young statues must fall
Smoke and explosions surround me
A flood of hate, it drowns me
I cannot live this way
No, I cannot live

Doubt and confusion
They find me
They run up right behind me
I cannot die this way
No, I cannot die this way

No one will ever understand why
Thousands of beautiful, healthy,
Young soldiers must fall

Smoke and explosions surround me
A flood of hate, it drowns me
I cannot live this way
I cannot live
With your doubt and confusion
They find me
They run up right behind me
I cannot die this way
No, I will not die this way
