When I get home, babe
Gonna light your fire
All day
I've been thinkin' about you, babe
You're my one desire

Gonna wrap my arms around you
Hold you close to me
Oh, babe I wanna taste your lips
I wanna fill your fantasy, yeah

I don't what I'd do without you, babe
Don't know where I'd be
You're not just another lover
No, you're everything to me

Ev'rytime I'm with you, baby
I can't believe it's true
When you're layin' in my arms
We do the things you do

You can see it in my eyes
I can feel it in your touch
You don't have to say a thing
Just let me show how much
Love you, need you, yeah

I wanna kiss you all over
And over again
I wanna kiss you all over
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in

Stay with me, lay with me
Holding me, loving me, baby
Here with me, near with me
Feeling you close to me, baby

So show me, show me ev'rything you do
'Cause baby no one does it quite like you
Love you, need you,
Oh, babe

I wanna kiss you all over
And over again
I wanna kiss you all over
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in

Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
