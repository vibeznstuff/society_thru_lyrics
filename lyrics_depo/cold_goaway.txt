All the sounds around you used to play along
With your torn up head
As the music seeps into you everyone was trampled
Dead
Everyone could see you madness slip in till it takes
Control
Everyone could see right through you I wish you would
Just go away

Go away from all the pain that made you half as 
Good as God taken all over in my Brain. I recall
The future take another star make him feel
The pain

For every song you ever wrote take another fucking 
Drink
For every melody that haunts take a pill that
Makes you faint
For every part of you that hurts take a 
Needle make it sting
The irony is I'm just like you a pseudo-
Fucking Freak
