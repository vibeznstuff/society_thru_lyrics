I can tell by your eyes 
That you've prob'bly been cryin' forever
And the stars in the sky don't mean nothin' to you
They're a mirror

I don't want to talk about it
How you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?

If I stand all alone
Will the shadow hide the colour of my heart
Blue for the tears, black for the night's fears

And the stars in the sky don't mean nothin' to you
They're a mirror

I don't want to talk about it, how you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
This ol' heart

If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
My heart, whoa, heart.
