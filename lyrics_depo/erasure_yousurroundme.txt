Don't ever let me take you for granted
You've got your finger on the pulse of my soul
Let me place a kiss in the small of your back
Love and protect you from the evils of this world

Baby don't ever leave me stranded
Whoever said that the streets were paved with gold
Well I'm afraid that we're all sadly mistaken
There's nothing here till we have someone to hold

I love you with all the joy of living
Till the lights go down on New York City
It's a special love affair
And there's magic in the air

You gotta shake me down
Bring me round to my senses
Till I'm lost and found
And you surround me with your senses

If love wasn't here would we reinvent it?
Oh take me down to the very root of my soul
Oh baby say it as if you really mean it
And feel the passion
Work its way up through your skin

I love you with all the joy of living
Till the lights go down on New York City
It's a special love affair
And there's magic in the air

You gotta shake me down
Bring me round to my senses
Till I'm lost and found
And you surround me with your senses

Let me take you by the hand
And we can go and find a brand new world
Star light
Star bright
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you to a safe place in this world

You gotta shake me down
Bring me round to my senses
Until I'm lost and found
And you surround me with your senses

And you gotta shake me down
Bring me round to my senses
Until I'm lost and found
And you surround me with your senses

And you gotta shake me down
Bring me round to my senses
Until I'm lost and found
And you surround me with your senses

And you gotta shake me down
Bring me round to my senses
Until I'm lost and found
And you surround me with your senses

And you gotta shake me down
Bring me round to my senses
Until I'm lost and found
And you surround me with your senses

And you gotta shake me down
Bring me round to my senses
Until I'm lost and found
And you surround me with your senses
