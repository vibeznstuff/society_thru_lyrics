Don't you know that this is the beginning (just a game)
Don't you know that this is just a game (just a game, it's just a game)


Stand tough (stand tough)
Never gonna get me down
Gotta get up to get up
Enough is enough
Stand tough (stand tough)
I'm never gonna give it up
Gotta get up to get up and up and up
Stand tough

This world is changing and the pressure's got me going down
My feet are walking from this sad and lonely one-horse town
Don't try and stop me 'cos I'm hurting from the cold outside
My heart is jumpin', jumpin', jumpin' and I don't know why



So what ya gonna do when it all comes down
Tell me (tell me), tell me (tell me)
What ya gonna do when it hits the ground (woah)



Had enough of everybody, telling me just what to do
I've got to get this message through the wire and straight to you
Bringing on the good times for the bitter ones are sure to end
We've got to make a stand 'cos on this world we all depend




Don't you know that this is the beginning (just a game)
Don't you know that this is just a game (just a game, just a game)

Stand tough (stand tough)
Never gonna get me down (come on)
Gotta get up to get up
Enough is enough
Stand tough (stand tough - huh)
I'm never gonna give it up (get down)
Gotta get up to get up (come on) and up (come on) and up (come on)

Stand tough (stand tough)
Never gonna get me down (get down)
Gotta get up to get up
Enough is enough
Stand tough (stand tough)
I'm never gonna give it up
Gotta get up to get up and up and up

Stand tough (stand tough)
Never gonna get me down
Gotta get up to get up
Enough is enough
Stand tough (stand tough)
I'm never gonna give it up
Gotta get up to get up and up and up
Stand tough (stand tough)
