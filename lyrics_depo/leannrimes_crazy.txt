Crazy...I'm crazy for feelin' so lonely
I'm crazy...crazy for feelin' so blue
I knew you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday, you'd leave me for somebody new.
Worry...why do I let myself worry?
Wonderin'...what in the world did I do?
I'm crazy...for thinkin' that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for tryin', and crazy for cryin'
And I'm crazy for lovin' you
I'm crazy...for thinkin' that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for tryin', and crazy for cryin'
And I'm crazy for lovin' you
