Shine On, Shine the Light on me,
In all of my Life so that much more I see
In the Light of his Love
In the Light of reflection
Oh what a world
Or sometimes oh so it seems
Eyes in the skies
In that silver gift friendship
A Glittering Prize
Is it the prize of lost loves
They can remember quiet sides of midnight
They can remember the attraction of fame
Like a Glittering Prize
I saw up on a clear day
First taking hearts
Then our last breath away

Always came a time - time was on our side
We were spending time - we were staring out
Catch me in a dream - Captured all in heart
We were spending time - we were staring out
Could there ever be - ever more than one
It's called an act of Love
Can you you never stop?

Shine On, Shine the Light on me,
In all of my Life
So much more I see
Like a Glittering Prize
I saw you up on a clear day
First taking heart then our last breath away
Only on a clear day coming into our lives

See it in the eye - satellite skies
We were spending time - we were staring out
Take in, Take in more - The Endless breath away
We were spending time - we were staring out
Could there ever be - ever more than one
It's called an act of Love
Can you you never stop?

Always on a clear day
Crashing into our lives
Is it the Price of Love
Like a Glittering Prize
Always on a clear day
Crashing into our lives
With your love
Only on a clear day
