You've been so good to me
Give you anything
You've been so good to me
Your love inside of me

Oh baby, you're my consolation
Oh baby, there's no hesitation
Oh baby, you're my consolation
Oh baby, there's no hesitation

Every sky would be blue
As long as you're loving me
Loving me

You've been so good to me
Give you anything
You've been so good to me
Your love inside of me

Oh baby, you're my consolation
Oh baby, there's no hesitation

Every sky would be blue
As long as you're loving me
Loving me
