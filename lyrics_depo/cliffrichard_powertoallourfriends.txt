Power to all our friends, to the music that never ends
To the people we want to be, baby power to you and me

There's one old man spends his life growing flowers
And caring for the bees - power to the bees
There's one old lady, spent her days making wine
The wine tasted fine
Power to the wine

Power to the boys who plays rock and roll and make my life so sweet
And to the girls I knew before and those I've yet to meet
Power to all our friends, to the music that never ends
To the people we want to be
Baby, power to you and me

There's one strong man, he's ploughing in the valley
He's living of the land - power to the land
There's some young girl laying down in Monte Carlo
Laying in the sun
Power to the sun

Power to the boys who plays rock and roll and make my life so sweet
And to the girls I knew before and those I've yet to meet
Power to all our friends, to the music that never ends
To the people we want to be
Baby, power to you and me

Power to the boys who plays rock and roll and make my life so sweet
And to the girls I knew before and those I've yet to meet
Power to all our friends, to the music that never ends
To the people we want to be, oh yeah, baby, power to you and me
To the music that never ends
Baby, power to all our friends
To the music that never ends
Baby, power to all our friends
