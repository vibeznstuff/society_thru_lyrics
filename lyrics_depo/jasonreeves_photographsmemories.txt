I keep your picture by my bed 
For when I'm feeling sad 
And I don't know why I would be 
The way your smile looks so real 
I feel like I could start to understand your grace 

But I 
I don't understand 
Why you're not here with me 
And I 
I don't even wanna know 
Where else you'd be 

'Cause I have photographs and memories 
Of the times 
When you weren't on my mind 
And I was alone 
And I have poetry and drawings 
Of my life when you weren't on my side 
And I didn't know 
Just what is love 

Writing moments on the wall 
The different color keeps 
My mind away from missing you 
And I can't wait to fall asleep 
Slip into my dreams 
Where we can dance upon the stars 

And I 
I'll be as patient as a boy 
In love could ever be 
And I 
I feel like I wasn't real 
Until you were a part of me 

'Cause I have photographs and memories 
Of the times 
When you weren't on my mind 
And I was alone 
And I have poetry and drawings 
Of my life 
You weren't on my side 
And I didn't know 
Just what is 

I need you back 
I need you back 
I need you here 

I need your smile 
I need your eyes 
I need you dear 

'Cause every line on your face 
Makes a beautiful maze 
For my eyes to trace 

Every line on your face 
Makes a beautiful maze 
For my eyes to trace 

Photographs and memories 
Of the times 
When you weren't on my mind 
And I was alone
