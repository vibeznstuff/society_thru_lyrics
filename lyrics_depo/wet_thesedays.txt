These days I can't take too much
I've been falling down, falling behind
These days I can't take so much
I've been falling down, falling behind

And I know what it takes
And I think we can make it
Through everything
You are all I need

Oh, I am away from you
Today I am away from you
Today time passed strangely
Today you don't know me, you said
Today I scare so easily

These days I can't take too much
I've been falling down, falling behind

And I know what it takes
And I think we can make it
Through everything
You are all I knew

And I have your heart
I love you more
And I take a stand
And I have your hand

And I know what it takes
And I know we can make it
Through everything
You are all I need

Oh, I am away from you
Today I am away from you
Today I passed strangely
Today you don't know me, you said
Today I scare so easily

Today I am away from you
Today I passed strangely
Today you don't know...
