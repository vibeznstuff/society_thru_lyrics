Girl you know I love this town, lived here all my life
Right up ‘til you left me, figured this would be where I’d die
Now I’m thinkin’ ‘bout a U-Haul, selling everything I can’t haul
Get a load of you off my chest move out west, maybe Utah

Find a little cabin in the hills, in the middle of Nowhereville
Irish setter, my old guitar, .22 rifle, and a rod and reel
Read that Bible Mama gave me
Maybe stumble on some words to save me
Think I’d really like the sound of a mountain breeze
And being somewhere where I can suffer in peace

Saw you last Saturday and I just about lost my cool
You were sittin’ in his car at the Tiger Mart by our old high school
Back to square one again, gettin’ over you over again
Girl I need to be somewhere else, ‘cause I don’t trust myself around you and him

I’m thinkin’ cabin in the hills, in the middle of Nowhereville
An Irish setter, my old guitar, a .22 rifle, and a rod and reel
Thumb through that Bible Mama gave me
Maybe stumble on some words to save me
You know I’d really like the sound of a mountain breeze
And being somewhere where I can suffer in peace

No TV, no telephone
Hang this heartache on a rainbow

And find a little cabin in the hills, in the middle of Nowhereville
My Irish setter, an old guitar, .22 rifle, and a rod and reel
Thumb through that Bible Mama gave me
Maybe stumble on some words to save me
You know I’d really like the sound of a mountain breeze
And being somewhere where I can suffer in peace
I can suffer in peace
Suffer in peace
