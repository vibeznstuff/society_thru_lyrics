I'm not saying it was your fault
Although you could have done more
Oh you're so naive yet so
How could this been done
By such a smiling sweetheart?
Oh, and your sweet and pretty face
In such an ugly world
For something so beautiful
Oh, that every time I look inside

I know, she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be... Well, she's still out to get me
And I know, she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be... She's still out to get me!

I may say it was your fault
Because I know you could have done more
Oh, you're so naive yet so
How could this be done
By such a smiling sweetheart?
Oh, and your sweet and pretty face
In such an ugly word
For something so beautiful
That every time I look inside

I know, she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be... Well, she's still out to get me
And I know, she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be... She's still out to get me!

So how could this be done
By such a smiling sweetheart
You're so naive yet so
You're such an ugly thing
For someone so beautiful
That every time you're on his side

I know, she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be... Well, she's still out to get me
And I know, she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be... She's still out to get me!

Just don't let me down
Just don't let me down
Hold on to your kite
Just don't let me down
Just don't let me down
Hold on to your kite
Just don't let me down
Just don't let me down
Hold on to this kite
Just don't let me down
