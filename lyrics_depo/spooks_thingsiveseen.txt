You won't believe the things I've seen 
Far beyond your wildest dreams 
I've seen chaos and order reign supreme 
I've seen the beauty of the universe 
so peaceful and serene 
in seconds turn to violence and screams 

I've seen true genius, too often to lose the meaningless 
appreciation of this mediocre nation 
I've heard the mind is repetition, 
of empty words without tradition 
Turned original verbs into submission 
I smelled this malignerance addiction, 
but I guess I wouldn't be right 
if I said the blunt was like a baby pipe 
There ain't gon' be no revolution tonight 
Half of my warriors as high as a kite 
Lost and they lost all they fight 
And I've tasted, the bitter tragedy of lives wasted 
And men who glimpsed the darkness inside, but never faced it 
And it's a shame that most of y'all are followin sheep 
Wallowin deeper than the darkness, you're fallin asleep 


You won't believe the things I've seen 
Far beyond your wildest dreams 
I've seen chaos and order reign supreme 
I've seen the beauty of the universe 
so peaceful and serene 
in seconds turn to violence and screams 

I've seen and experienced things 
that'll push the average to the edge and swan dive to death 
I'm two guys, multiplied by ninety-three guys 
Evenly balanced seein evil equally in each eye now 
Maybe I'm the most thorough worker on the job to you 
or maybe I'm the one, who was plottin to rob you 
The fear of this beatdown, the women on no cash to floss 
makes most of y'all hustle ya ass off 
From nothin to two mill', in five years I'll live to see it 
vanish in six months, with no tears believe it 
I'll rock, twenty-eight years before the Feds can lay a trace 
See they plan is to erase me, just to replace me 

Life! Your heart is one with your brain 
Emotional or reason, now which one do you obey? 
Life! Somebody callin you insane 
When overwhelmed and blessed, burst in tears of happiness 

Yo, yo, I've seen relationships that's so sick 
Life long friendships so cha-o-tic 
Thug cat bangin this chick but won't kiss 
Drinkin her spit, when coppin a fix for dope bliss 
I got a knife and a bat, to bust your brain, put a knife in your back 
"Once in the Life" I was trifle like that 
like my man Troy, who lost his days 
shootin dice on worldly ways 
and ended up in a early grave 
Because once in a lifetime is rough 
Twice in a lifetime you combat the ghost of mistrust 
Mentally cuffed, thrust by a cop thinkin he tough 
You bust, Amadou Diallo is us, and what 
now I'm on my knees, beggin' "God, please! 
Save me from the fires of hell! 
Let water water soul prevail" - cos I can't take no more 
Who's that knockin, at, my door? 
Is that you, Pete from Cobb's Creek, who died in my sleep? 
We was playin for fun, now it's keeps 
Like my man Mark I beat to death wrapped in a carpet 
and left in the garbage, now that's cold-hearted 
Ask Book he saw it, "Yo black I ain't seen (shit) 
Kids in the 6, they flip for nonsense" 
Poke an icepick, smokin that (shit) since preschool fool 
and packin a tool, (fuck you) Mom Dukes it's cool 


You won't believe the things I've seen 
Far beyond your wildest dreams 
I've seen chaos and order reign supreme 
I've seen the beauty of the universe 
so peaceful and serene 
in seconds turn to violence and screams 

Life! Your heart is one with your brain 
Emotional or reason, now which one do you obey? 
Life! Somebody callin you insane 
When overwhelmed and blessed, burst in tears of happiness
