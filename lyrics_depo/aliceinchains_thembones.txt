Aaah! Aaah! Aaah! Aaah!

I believe them bones are me
Some say we're born into the grave

I feel so alone, gonna end up a
Big ole pile of them bones

Aaah! Aaah! Aaaaaaaaah!

Dust rise right on over my time
Empty fossil of the new scene

I feel so alone, gonna end up a
Big ole pile of them bones

Toll due bad dream come true
I lie dead gone under red sky

I feel so alone, gonna end up a
Big ole pile of them...
I feel so alone, gonna end up a
Big ole pile of them...
I feel so alone, gonna end up a
Big ole pile of them bones
