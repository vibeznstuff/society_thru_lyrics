How could they know 
Thank you for the autographs
And the cheers over the years
You stood by me, you didn't doubt me
I think you want some more
I do more than sing
I model now
Actin' now
Plus I got my own movie now
After all the awards
That they gave me
You stood by me
You didn't play me, you didn't doubt me
Think you want some more
I truly believe that if it wasn't my for you
I don't know what I would do (ooh)
