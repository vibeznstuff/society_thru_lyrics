I dreamed myself from the sultry plains
to the old green square back in old Maybole
Rode the wind up to Stornaway
paused at the peak, pacified my soul
Caught the bus at the faery fort
made it to the mansion on the Boyne
See I come around to the ancient ways
I took a tip from the buddha boy

I just found god
I just found god
I just found god where he always was

We came down from the hill of dreams
Bernadette, mother earth and you and me
through Carraroe, down the wildwood side
blinding out eyes in the shallow seas
Drank fire with the King of the Blues,
plugged in to the medicine way
Took a long last look at Crazy Horse
push now for a golden age

I just found god
I just found god
I just found god where he always was

I found myself on the roof of the world
just waiting for to get my wings
Strange angel in the changing light
said "Brother, you forgot something!"
My heart beat from the inside out
so lucky just to be alive!
Can you tell what I'm talking about?
any day now the Sun's gonna rise

I just found god
I just found god
I just found god where he always was
I just found god where he always was

There is a green hill far away 
I'm going back there one fine day
