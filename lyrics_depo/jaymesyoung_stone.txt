Your father came and went like the ocean's tide
And the day he left he never said goodbye
Your mother started drinking like the whole world died
You've been waiting for a miracle all your life

Cause if the fires don't burn it down
The rains will wash it away
If you're looking for solid ground
A stone will never break

So give me all your pain
And love will set you free
Give me all your shame
Put all your weight on me
And I'll be the stone that you need me to be

You spend your nights looking at the stars
Thinking your life would be better on Mars
Checking your pulse just to feel it beat
Looking for a stone to keep the peace

Give me all your pain
And love will set you free
Give me all your shame
Put all your weight on me
And I'll be the stone that you need me to be

Cause if the fires don't burn it down
The rains will wash it away
And if you're looking for solid ground
A stone will never break

So give me all your pain
And love will set you free
Give me all your shame
Put all your weight on me
Give me all your pain
And love will set you free
Give me all your shame
Put all your weight on me
And I'll be the stone that you need me to be
And I'll be the stone that you need me to be
