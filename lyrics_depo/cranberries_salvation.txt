To all those people doin' lines, 
Don't do it, don't do it. 
Inject your soul with liberty, 
It's free, it's free. 

To all the kids with heroin eyes, 
Don't do it, don't do it. 
Because it's not not what it seems, 
No no it's not not what it seems. 

Salvation, salvation, salvation is free. 
Salvation, salvation, salvation is free. 

Ah, ah, ah, ah 

To all the parents with sleepless nights, 
Sleepless nights. 
Tie your kids home to their beds, 
Clean their heads. 

To all the kids with heroin eyes, 
Don't do it, don't do it. 
Because it's not not what it seems, 
No no it's not not what it seems. 

Salvation, salvation, salvation is free. 
Salvation, salvation, salvation is free. 

Salvation, salvation, salvation is free. 
Salvation, salvation, salvation is free. 

Ah, ah, ah, ah
