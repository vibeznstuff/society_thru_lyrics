I wish that you were here
Down amongst the dust
I need someone to help me
You need someone to trust
There's something with these tears
Turning me to rust
I need someone to help me
Yeah I need someone to touch

Give me one more try
And I'll come flaking back to you
I wish that you were here
I wish that it was true

I can feel the stars shooting through my heart like rain
Leaving on the scars where the pleasure turns to pain
Point me in a light
Bright and shiny in right direction
And then take me home again

Just when you thing it's over
Just when you think it's done
Out of every nowhere
You never see it come
I know the lines are showing
I can't keep them in
Like everybody's story
It's written on the skin

Give me one last try
And I'll make it up to you
Wish that you were here
Wish that I was true

I can feel the stars shooting through my heart like rain
Leaving on the scars where the pleasure turns to pain
Point me in a light
Bright and shiny in right direction
And then take me home again

I wish that you were here
Down amongst my dust
I need someone to help me
You need someone to trust
There's something with these tears
Turning me to rust
I wish that you were here
I wish that it was ours

I can feel the stars shooting through my heart like rain
Leaving on the scars where the pleasure turns to pain
Point me in a light
Bright and shiny in right direction
And then take me home again

... Everything's gonna be all right ...
