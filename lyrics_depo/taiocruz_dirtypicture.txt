I could dream of ways to see you
I could close my eyes to dream
I could fantasize about you
Tell the world what I believe

But whenever I'm not with you
It's so hard for me to see
I need to see a picture of you
A special picture just for me, yeah

So take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture

Just send the dirty picture to me
Send the dirty picture
Just send the dirty picture to me
Send the dirty picture, picture, picture, picture, picture

Snap, snap, uh

Whenever you are gone
I just wanna be wit' ya
Please don't get me wrong
I just wanna see a picture

Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture

Whenever you are gone
I just wanna be wit' ya
Please don't get me wrong
I just wanna see your picture

Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture

The dream of ways to see you
I could close my eyes to dream
Fantasize about this with you
But the way is never seen, oh

Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture

Just send the dirty picture to me
Send the dirty picture
Send the dirty picture to me
Send the dirty picture

Uh, snap, snap, snap

Whenever you are gone

Please don't get me wrong
I just wanna see your picture
