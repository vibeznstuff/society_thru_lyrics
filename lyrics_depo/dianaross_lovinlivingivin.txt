My love was in a storm
The bitter wind was blowin' around me
I'd sit and cry but
By and by it just faded away

Rainbow, painted skies,
Brought a smile into my eyes
The scent of flowers filled the air
I turned around and you were there

Hey, you made me see
That love is the key
To make the sun shine
For me

Ooh, Since you came
I feel like lovin' again
I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' again

Ooh ooh, since you came
I feel like lovin' again
And I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' again

One kiss is worth a thousand sighing words
When you're lonely
I saw you smile
It was warm
Now I see beyond the storm

Clouds are fading fast
There goes the sad and bitter past
You touched my life
When no one cared
You did the things that no one dared
You've opened doors

You've made me see
That love is the key
To make the sun shine
For me

Ooh, Since you came
I feel like lovin' again
And I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' givin' again

Since you came
I feel like lovin' again
And I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' givin' again

Since you came
I feel like lovin' again
And I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' again

Since you came
I feel like lovin' again
And I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' again

Since you came
I feel like lovin' again
And I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' again
