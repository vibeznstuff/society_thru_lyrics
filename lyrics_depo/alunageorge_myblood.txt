Always someone pull those strings
Chuck you in and watch you swayin'
Waiting for that big cha-ching
See how much your life can bring

You're taking the fall now
You're taking the blame
It's taking you nowhere
Getting you low and crushing your faith
You gotta believe me
They don't see love
They're living in hate
And you just don't know that they just be playing
You're taking the bait

If you want my blood, oh
Join me at the front, oh
If you want my love, oh
You better come see me
You better come see me
You better come see me, see me

Always more to sacrifice
Insatiable appetite
When you look in the mirror
And there's no one that you recognize
Now that you've been sacrificed
I bet you're looking, looking for paradise

You're taking the fall now
You're taking the blame
It's taking you nowhere
Getting you low and crushing your faith
You gotta believe me
They don't see love
They're living in hate
And you just don't know that they just be playing
You're taking the bait

If you want my blood, oh
Join me at the front, oh
If you want my love, oh
You better come see me
You better come see me
You better come see me, see me

If you want my blood, oh
Join me at the front, oh
If you want my love, oh

If you want my blood
Join me at the front
If you want my love
