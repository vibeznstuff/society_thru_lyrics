I've known that before it's come and it's gone
For all that it's been, it's never been very long
What always seems to come is goodbye

But I believe in this love, it's not like before
My journey is done, I've come to the end of the road
'Cause without you there's just nowhere to go

And this time love won't walk out on me again
This time I know I can win, sure as the stars in the sky
You and I

With each gentle kiss, I'll show you I missed
The warmth of your touch and now it's plain to see
I need the love you're giving to me

I won't measure the love I feel inside
For one thing I've learned, it may only last for a while
Or maybe for the rest of our lives

And this time love won't walk out on me again
This time I know I can win, sure as the stars in the sky

And this time I really believe that I found
Love at its best and so now
Love is forever this time

Now that you're ready, I'll never again be alone

And this time love won't walk out on me again
This time I know I can win
Sure as the stars in the sky

And this time I really believe in God above
Love at its best and so now don't ever leave me behind
No, not this time, no, not this time
No, not this time, no, not this time
