Take a journey back in time
Leave the western world behind
Cross the mountains to Peking
Where the paper lanterns gently swing

The Chinese way
Who knows what they know
The Chinese legend grows

The Chinese way
Who knows what they know
The Chinese legend grows

My eyes wide open
I feel a breeze
Words softly spoken
In Cantonese

Standing at the master's side
Then with patience he confides
Secret knowledge, sacred ways
Pearls of wisdom from the dragon days

I could never lie
For honor I would die
Following the Chinese way

So many years ago
Heroes ruled the world
(Some died for love in a cruel world)
They were the only ones in a cruel world

I could never lie
For honor I would die
Following the Chinese way

From the mountains to Peking
Where the paper lanterns gently swing

The Chinese way
Who knows what they know
The Chinese legend grows

The Chinese way
Who knows what they know
The Chinese legend grows

The Chinese way
Who knows what they know
The Chinese legend grows

The Chinese way
Who knows what they know
The Chinese legend grows
