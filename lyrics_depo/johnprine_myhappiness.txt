Evening shadows make me blue when each weary day is through
How I long to be with you my happiness
Everyday I reminisce dreaming of your tender kiss
Always thinking how I miss my happiness

A million years it seems have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again there'll be no blue memories then
Where the skies are grey or blue anyplace on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you my happiness

A million years it seems have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again there'll be no blue memories then
Where the skies are grey or blue anyplace on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you my happiness
