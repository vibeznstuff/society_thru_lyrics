Dictation being forced in Afghanistan
Revolution in South Africa taking a stand
People in Eurasia on the brink of oppression
I hope it's going to be alright
I hope the music plays forever

Forests falling at a desperate pace
The earth is dying, and desert taking its place
People under pressure on the brink of starvation

I hope it's gonna be alright
(Alright Alright Alright)
'Cause the music plays forever
('Cause it goes on and on and on and on and on)
I hope it's gonna be alright
(On and on and on and on, forever)
And the music plays forever
(Alright Alright)

Generations will come and go (will come and go)
But there's one thing for sure
Music is our life's foundation
And shall succeed all the nations to come

(Alright Alright Alright)
'Cause the music plays forever
('Cause it goes on and on and on and on and on)
I hope it's gonna be alright
(On and on and on and on and on)
(On and on and on and on)
And the music plays forever

The year three thousand may still come to pass
But the music shall last
I can hear it on a timeless wavelength
Never dissipating but giving us strength

(It's alright)
I think it's gonna be alright
(It's gonna be alright)
(Alright Alright Alright Alright)
'Cause the music plays forever
(Eeh-oh-oh-eeh)
(Gonna be alright)
If the music plays forever
(It will be alright)
If the music plays forever
(I think it's gonna be alright)
It's gonna be alright
(If the music plays)
It's all - alright
It's alright
(For it goes on and on and on and on)
(On and on and on and on)
