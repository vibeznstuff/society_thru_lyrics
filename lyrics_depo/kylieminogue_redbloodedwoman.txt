Count backwards, 5 4 3 2 1, before you get too heated and turned on, (This guy),
You should have learned your lessons all them times before, youve been bruised youve been broken,
Then theres my mind sayin think before you go, through that door it could lead you nowhere, (This guy)
Has got you all romantic, crazy in your head,do you think id listen, no i dont care,
Cause I can't focus I can't stop,
You got me spinning round, 
round, round, round (Like a record),
I can't focus it's too hot (Inside), 
You'll never get to Heaven if you're scared of getting high,


Boy, boy, Let 
me keep freakin around,
I wanna get down,
I'm a red blooded woman, what's 
the point in hanging round,
Don't wanna keep turning it down, When this girl wants to rock with you.(x2)


My conscience saying, get down off this dream, it's 
too dangerous and deadly, (This guy)
Has got you talking round in circles can't you 
see, all for the sake of sexy (You're loving it),
Then there's my sense 
saying stop before you fall, I don't wanna pick you up again, (This guy)
Has got you all romantic, crazier each day, Do you think I'd listen, There's no way.
Cause I can't focus I can't stop,
You got me spinning round, 
round, round, round (Like a record),
I can't focus it's too hot (Inside), 
You'll never get to Heaven if you're scared of getting high,



Let me keep freakin around,
Red blooded woman,
Its too hot inside,
You'll never get to Heaven if your scared of gettin high!
