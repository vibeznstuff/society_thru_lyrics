You will you won't
You do you don't
You're saying you will
But you know you won't
You may you might
Your chest gets tight
You say you love day
But you come out at night
While your thinking, thinking, thinking up a storm in you
All the things you're thinking, are they false, are they true
You know the dipsydoodle rag, it tells no lie
But all the time you're thinking, well you're tricking your mind

You will you won't
You do you don't
You're saying you will
But you know you won't
You may you might
Your chest gets tight
You say you love day
But you come out at night

Well the devil's standing tall on the top of the hill
Pointing down his fork and betraying your will
You gotta make decisions whether old or new
Then god comes from the heavens and he'll say to you

You will you won't
You do you don't
You're saying you will
But you know you won't
You may you might
Your chest gets tight
You say you love day
But you come out at night

Well I've tried so hard
I've tried so hard
To make it right
To make it right
I'm gonna bury my thoughts
And forget all my worries
Tonight

You will you won't
You do you don't
You're saying you will
But you know you won't
You may you might
Your chest gets tight
You say you love day
But you come out at night
