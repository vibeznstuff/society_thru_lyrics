Somebody told me that I'd always have to bow
if that was true I would have fallen apart by now
The more you think, the less you act their way
So can you hear this, the fake sound of progress?

Never reason with a fool, but is that unkind?
looks like I've lost my mind once again
I know it all sounds so contrived, but it's got to me
you know I've got to be more than this
don't frown, don't scorn, cause I walk a different street to you
You look so worn, i bet that life has got you blown
but it will never get to me
Somebody told me that I'd always have to bow
if that was true I would have fallen apart by now
the more you think, the less you act their ways
So can you hear this, the fake sound of progress?
and I feel the way you hold, hold me back from this
Chances that I've missed, now they're gone
Apathy is all I sense, the feeling's too intense
Sitting on a fence and can't decide
don't frown, don't scorn, cause I walk a different street to you
you look so worn, i bet that life is has got you blown
no body will ever get to me
somebody told me that I always have to bow
if that was true I would have fallen apart by now
the more you think, the less you act their ways
So can you hear this, the fake sound of progress?

All these words that I accounted for, never fear another day
always charged but I need more, make me take away
tell me now, can you hear the sound
of all these people falling down
growing back into the ground let me smile again...
SWING IT

Tell me now can you hear the sound, of the record spinning
round and round, for on and on it sounds like the same old
song that I keep singing, it sounds like

dah dah dah dah (yeahyeah sounds like) dah dah dah dah
(all these words that I accounted for, I'll never fear another day always charged and I want more, make me take away, all these words that I accounted for, I'll never fear another day, it makes, me, take, away)

somebody told me that I'd always have to bow
if that was true I would have fallen apart by now
the more you think, the less you act their ways
So can you hear this, the fake sound of progress?

yeah yeah yeah progress

make me smile again
(the fake sound of progress)
