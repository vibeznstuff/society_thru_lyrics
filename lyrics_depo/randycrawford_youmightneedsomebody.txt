When somebody reaches for your heart
Open up and let them through
Everybody needs someone around
Things can tumble down on you

You discover when you look around
You don't have to be alone
Just one lover is all you need to know
When you're feeling all alone

Oh oh you might need somebody
You might need somebody, too
(You might need somebody too)

If there's fire stolen in you're heart
And you're sure it's wrong and right
She'd be blinded through the cold and I
It can warm your lonely nights
Yeah

(Need somebody) (Need somebody) Oh you might need somebody...
