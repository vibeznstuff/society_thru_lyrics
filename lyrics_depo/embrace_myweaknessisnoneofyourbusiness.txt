Don't wanna let you down
I've been lucky I was lost
Now I'm found

You could be the first
In the universe, who's glad
They're watered down

And that's why
I get that shallow feeling that you like
I'll never learn that I can't win

Don't wanna make a row
You do and it's your loss
I'm around

I don't mind doing everything
Hallelujah, you're the one
Come back now

Sometimes
I get that shallow feeling that you like
That you're hurt, don't change a thing

Because my weakness is none of your business
But bad will always collect to one big melting pot
And all my weakness is none of your business
Somehow it always collects to one big melting pot

This could be our time
This could be our time
This could be our time
