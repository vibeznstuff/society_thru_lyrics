Spreadin faster than an eye can blink
So I had to sit down and take time to think
Of how to spread the word to people all across the land
To make sure they putting out a helping hand
Neneh Cherry notice hurry so it must be told
About a group of people left in the cold
Caught by a plague slowly they fade
From immune deficiency you see called "AIDS"
No knowledge of the facts, kept in the dark
Scolds my soul and it hurts my heart
The young and elderly just running blind
Hurts so bad they denied their own kind
Papa turned around and said that ain't mine
It just made it hard for life on the line
And it's a shame to see a little child mature
Growing up knowing that there ain't no cure 

I've got you under my skin
I've got you under my skin 

...Pure pain they give me... 

I had a friend once by the name of MARY JANE
Out with the guys and getting high was her only game
And now the tears in her eyes, there she lies
It drove her crazy, all the boys say that's it
I told you so but you reached the point of no return
Instead of pride you take the hardest way you had to learn
Oh mommy dearest, don't you know that I miss her so
That's why I sing this song
Just to let her know 

I've got you under my skin
I've got you under my skin 

I've got you deep in the heart of me
Down so deep in any part of me
I've got you, got you, got you under my skin 

I've got you deep in the heart of me
Down so deep in any part of me
I've got you, got you, got you under my skin 

Use your mentality, wake up to reality
I've got you deep in the heart of me
Share your love, don't share the needle.
