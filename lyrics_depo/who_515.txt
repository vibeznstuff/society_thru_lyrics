Why should I care?
Why should I care?

Girls of fifteen
Sexually knowing
The ushers are sniffing
Eau-de-cologning

The seats are seductive
Celibate sitting
Pretty girls digging
Prettier women

Magically bored
On a quiet street corner
Free frustration
In our minds and our toes

Quiet storm water
M-m-my generation
Uppers and downers
Either way blood flows

Inside outside, leave me alone
Inside outside, nowhere is home
Inside outside, where have I been?
Out of my brain on the 5:15
Out of my brain on the train
Out of my brain on the train

A raft in the quarry
Slowly sinking
Back of a lorry
Holy hitching

Dreadfully sorry
Apple scrumping
Born in a war
Birthday punching

He man drag
In the glittering ballroom
Gravely outrageous
In my high heel shoes

Tightly undone
Know what they're showing
Sadly ecstatic
That their heroes are news

Inside outside, leave me alone
Inside outside, nowhere is home
Inside outside, where have I been?
Out of my brain on the 5:15
Out of my brain on the train
Out of my brain on the train, on the train
I'm out of my brain

Out of my brain on the train
Here it comes
Out of my brain, on the train, on the train
Out of my brain on the train

Why should I care?
Why should I care?
