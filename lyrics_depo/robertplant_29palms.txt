A fool in love - a crazy situation
Her velvet glove knocks me down and down and down
Her kiss of fire - a loaded invitation
Inside her smile she takes me down and down and down

Her moves look good - a touch of desparation
From where I stood she turned my head around, round and round

It comes kinda hard when I hear your voice on the radio
Taking me back down the road that leads back to you
29 Palms - I feel the heat of your desert heart
Taking me back down the road that leads back to you

Oh, I'm burning in love - a strange infatuation
White cold cold touch - what must I do, do, do
The heat and the dust increase my desolation
In God we trust - always for you, and you and you

It comes kinda hard
