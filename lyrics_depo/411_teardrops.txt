Too many times you crossed the line,
but you came crawling back to me,
Sayin 'We can be friends, it's not the end'
tryin to fix it with sorry,
you'd cheated, you'd lied, you'd made me cry,
left me alone with no affection,
now look at you broke, I hope you choke,
You know you're tears and all you're tension,



He'll take you're heart, (he'll take you're heart, he'll take you're heart)
Destroy each and every part, (each and every part)
Even calling in the dark
'Cos he's dangerous, (oooooooo) and then he's dangerous, (oooooooo)



Teardrops, come again,
I can almost feel your pain,
I never ever thought the day would come,
when I would be the lucky one,
To see you hurt,
To see you cry,
Gives my soul a natural high
Think about the times you walked on me,
Your teardrops came to set me free.



You seem to bring the pain and once again,
I'm out the situation,
You were about to hold me down
You were the cause of my frustration,
Now I see you cry,
you wipe your eyes,
You promised me you've changed,
but in the end you're still the same
How can the player change his game?



He'll take you're heart, (he'll take you're heart, he'll take you're heart)
Destroy each and every part, (each and every part)
Even calling in the dark
'Cos he's dangerous, (oooooooo) and then he's dangerous, (oooooooo)



Teardrops, come again,
I can almost feel your pain,
I never ever thought the day would come,
when I would be the lucky one,
To see you hurt,
To see you cry,
Gives my soul a natural high
Think about the times you walked on me,
Your teardrops came to set me free.



He's In your mind,
He's a shadow in the night,
In his eyes there is no light,
'Cos he's dangerous, and then he's dangerous



Teardrops, come again,
I can almost feel your pain,
I never ever thought the day would come,
when I would be the lucky one,
To see you hurt,
To see you cry,
Gives my soul a natural high?
Think about the times you walked on me,
Your teardrops came to set me free.



Teardrops, come again,
I can almost feel your pain,
I never ever thought the day would come,
when I would be the lucky one,
To see you hurt,
To see you cry,
Gives my soul a natural high
Think about the times you walked on me,
Your teardrops came to set me free.
