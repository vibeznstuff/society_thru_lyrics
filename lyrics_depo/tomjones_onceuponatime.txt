Once upon a time there was an Eden,
woa
Once upon a time Adam and Eve,
A ...fell in love
Um...they fell in love
Like you and I
Like you and I

Once upon a time there was Delilah,
um
Once upon a time the devil and she
A...tempted man
Oh yes...a tempted man.
A..just like you
Are tempting me

Once upon a time
I knew just what to do
But that was long before
I met you, yes,
Once upon a time
I knew just what to do
But now I've fallen in love
Oh yes, I've fallen in love with you.
