Na Na
Niiiiiiiiiii
Girlssssss, I fuck with themmmm

I don't usually fall in love with them
But you should be prescribed to me
Some chicks are drugs to men
A lot deserve the finer things in life
And I think your one of them
Money ain't shit got loads to blow, show me a signal
Let me know, if you wanna have a better life then baby you no where to go
Its coming I quick, it ain't flowing in slow
Like I said let me know, if weezy made it rain
Then I can make it snow

Girlssssss, I'm loving them
But I won't let them get the best of me
Girlssss, I'm loving them
I get them all around the world
What would I do without you
What would you do without me
Don't need to tell you baby coz its plain for us to see
Tonighhtttt
Girlssss, I'm loving them
girls girls girls

Guyyyyss, I fuck with them
They be pinging off my phone telling me they all alone
And they sitting at home while I'm trying to get that dough
And that's why they call me the baddest bitch
Coz I switch off the rolls
I'm the one that drives the crazy
They all wish I was there lady
But I'm earning more than them and they say damn that bitch is lazy
I am the biggest female boss that ever lived
And everything that you done I've been and did

Girlssssss, I'm loving them
But I won't let them get the best of me
Girlssss, I'm loving them
I get them all around the world
What would I do without you
What would you do without me,
Don't need to tell you baby coz its plain for us to see
Tonighhtttt
Girlssss, I'm loving them
girls girls girls

When your girlfriend says she's on her way
And your staring at the clock in frustration thinking why is she so late
I just can't live without them, they'll break your heart no doubt
I'm the reason why she's never coming back
Simply can't leave me around them

Girlsssss, I fuck with them
Tell em anything they wanna hear so by the end of the night, I'm fucking them
Girlsss, I fuck with them
And I know they all gassed not like Mariah
You know what I'm in love in with theeeeemmmm!

Girlssssss, I'm loving them
But I won't let them get the best of me
Girlssss, I'm loving them
I get them all around the world
What would I do without you
What would you do without me
Don't need to tell you baby coz its plain for us to see
Tonighhtttt
Girlssss, I'm loving them
