Riding along on a carousel
Trying to catch up to you
Riding along on a carousel
Will I catch up to you

Horses chasing 'cause they're racing
So near yet so far
On a carousel, on a carousel

Nearer, nearer by changing horses
Still so far away
People fighting for their places
Just get in the way

Soon you'll leave and then I'll lose you
Still we're going round
On a carousel, on a carousel

Round and round and round and round and round
And round and round and round with you
Up, down, up, down, up, down too

As she leaves she drops the presents
That she won before
Pulling ducks out of the water
Got the highest score

Now's my chance and I must take it
A case of do-or-die
On a carousel, on a carousel

Round and round and round and round and round
And round and round and round with you
Up, down, up, down, up, down too

Riding along on a carousel
Trying to catch up to you
Riding along on a carousel
Will I catch up to you

Now we take our ride together
No more chasing her
On a carousel, on a carousel

On a carousel, on a carousel
