Look at all that shines
Baby's down on the world and she knows it
If your spirit's running
Why don't me make it rain like we used to
We run
We hide
We wait and we want
The good life
Aw sure
You're right
This ain't, the good life

Ah, Elegantly wasted
Ah, Elegantly wasted

Look at all the crimes
Baby's down on the world cause she owns it
Making up her life
Nothing more, nothing less makes it Voodoo
We run
We hide
We wait and we want
The good life
Aw sure
You're right
This ain't, the good life

Ah, Elegantly wasted
Ah, Elegantly wasted

We look at all that shines
Baby's down on the world and she knows it
If your spirit's fine
Why don't we make it rain like we used to
We run
We hide
We want
The good life
Aw sure
You're right
This ain't, the good life

Ah, Elegantly wasted
(you could be right, you could be certain, you could be right)
Ah, Elegantly wasted
Ah, Elegantly wasted
(you could be right, you could be certain, you could be right)
Ah, Elegantly wasted (feels like, feels like)
Elegantly wasted - you could be right
Elegantly wasted - you could be certain
Elegantly wasted - you could be right
Feels right, feels right
