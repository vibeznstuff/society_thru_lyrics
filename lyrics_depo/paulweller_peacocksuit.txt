I've got a grapefruit matter
It's as sour as shit
I have no solutions
Better get used to it

I don't need a ship to sail in stormy weather
I don't need you to ruffle the feathers - of my Peacock Suit
I'm Narcissus in a puddle
In shop windows I gloat
Like a ball of fleece lining
In my camel skin coat

I don't need a ship to sail in stormy weather
I don't need you to ruffle the feathers - of my Peacock Suit
Did you think I should

Nemesis in a muddle
In a mirror I look
Like a streak of sheet lightnin'
In my rattleskin shoes

I don't need a ship to sail in stormy weather
I don't need you to ruffle the feathers - of my Peacock Suit
Did you think I should
