I heard Tarzan outside playing on the Jungle Blues
I know 'cos I saw him shimmer in a Kenyan pool
Coming on in the vines with his leopard-skin lioncloth cool
Bony Watusi fingers
Beating on the bark of a tree
Now Tarzan and me, well, obviously we're like that
Me and Tarzan, yeah we get on like a house on fire

Look at cool Louise she's the one with the knick-knack eyes
She's only 17 but she knows how to make boys fight
Yeah she'll slit you with her eyes an' she'll slash you
With her cut-back smile
Ah she's as cruel as a pig but we love her like a house on fire
Louise and me now obviously we're like that
Yes me and Louise we'll make it like a house on fire

I saw a raw white angel executing loop-de-loops in the sky
Drawing lazy spirals with his slipstream smoke as he silently
Passed us by
But his halo got too heavy so he hung it down around his waist
Doing halo hula-hoops, executing loop-de-loops takes a lot of
Skill and bad taste
Now the angel and me obviously we're like that
Me and the devil we get it on like a house on fire
