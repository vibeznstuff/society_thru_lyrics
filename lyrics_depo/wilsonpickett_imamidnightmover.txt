I'm a midnight mover, all-night groover 
I'm a midnight teaser, real soul pleaser 
I'm a midnight hugger, all-night lover 
Trust in me when you're down &amp; out 
I will always bring you out 
They call me the midnight mover, oh yeah

I'm a midnight walker, sweet soul talker 
I'm a midnight creeper, all-day sleeper 
I'm a midnight rover, after lookin' things over 
Leave your lovelight shinin' bright 
Make me know that everything's all right

I'm a mover, groover, teaser, pleaser 
Hugger, lover, walker, talker 
Got to be a midnight mover 
Got to be a midnight groover 
Got to be a midnight teaser 
Got to be a real soul pleaser 
Got to be a midnight hugger 
Got to be a midnight lover 
Got to be a midnight walker 
Got to be a midnight talker 
Got to be a midnight creeper
