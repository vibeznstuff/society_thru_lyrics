Ohh, how about a round of applause,
Hey, standin' ovation,
Ooh ohh yeah, yeah yeah yeah.

You look so dumb right now,
Standin' outside my house,
Tryin' to apologize,
You're so ugly when you cry,
Please, just cut it out.

Don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not,
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught,
But you put on quite a show (oh),
You really had me goin',
But now it's time to go (oh),
Curtain's finally closin',
That was quite a show (oh),
Very entertainin',
But it's over now (but it's over now),
Go on and Take A Bow, ohh ohh.

Grab your clothes and get gone (get gone),
You better hurry up before the sprinklers come on (come on),
Talkin' 'bout girl, I love you, you're the one,
This just looks like a re-run,
Please, what else is on.

And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not (mmm),
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught (mmm),
But you put on quite a show (oh),
You really had me goin',
But now it's time to go (oh),
Curtain's finally closin',
That was quite a show (oh),
Very entertainin',
But it's over now (but it's over now),
Go on and take a bow, ohh.

And the award for the best liar goes to you (goes to you),
For makin' me believe that you could be faithful to me,
Let's hear your speech out.
(But you put on quite a show
You really had me goin'),

But now it's time to go (oh),
Curtain's finally closin',
That was quite a show (oh),
Very entertainin',
But it's over now (but it's over now),
Go on and take a bow.

But it's over now...
