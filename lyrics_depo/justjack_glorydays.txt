I'm feelin groovy 
Kicking down the cobble stones 
And there is music in every sight and every sound 
No need for headphones 
I'll tip my cap to the world 
Even though I don't wear one 
Grinning at the women in the salon 
Getting their hair done 
On the outside looking in 
Like an aquarium 
Spinning with the stars in the planetarium 
Deliriously 
Mysteriously 
I'm feeling curiously marvelously 
Super 
Duper 
Like Joss Stone 
My heart melts like ice cream cones 
Grinning like a dog digging up dinosaur bones 
I used to be fossilized 
But now I'm out of my shell 
And I'm happier than whores with chivalrous clientele 
This can't be real 
I must be dreaming 
Can somebody slap me 
I'm feeling so mischievous 
Original cheeky chappy 
It must be ages 
Since I felt satisfied 
Just to be Just Jack 
And just that, still in tact 

Its just another one of those glory days 
Jump out your bed 
Shake your head 
Clear the haze 
Step out your house 
And prepared to be amazed 
It's just another one of those 
Just another one of those 
Just another one of those glory days 
Jump out your bed 
Shake your head 
Clear the haze 
Step out your house 
And prepare to be amazed 
It's just another one of those glory days 

I'm so warm 
New dawn 
Reborn 
New forms 
And I'm thinking about my boys 
Joe le chic, and Freshly Sean 
And I know you're underrated 
But one day we'll all make it 
And walk around naked with our bollocks platinumed and plated 
Anyway I'm off track 
Gotta stop that 
And get back to the high street 
I need something to eat 
Stop at the caf' 
Coffee and a salt beef bagel 
Yea I know I'm caned/Cain'd 
But now I'm feeling able/Abel 
I used to get so paranoid in places like this 
Stayed in my house for days with my weed psychosis 
My neurosis was thinking everybody is staring at my red eyes 
And shifty expression 
But now I'm past caring 
And I can feel that destiny is on my side 
And by the looks of things 
Fate came along for the ride 
Behind green skies I can see my girl's eyes 
Damn it I'm in love with this planet 
You gotta realize 

Its just another one of those glory days 
Jump out your bed 
Shake your head 
Clear the haze 
Step out your house 
And prepared to be amazed 
It's just another one of those 
Just another one of those 
Just another one of those glory days 
Jump out your bed 
Shake your head 
Clear the haze 
Step out your house 
And prepare to be amazed 

Its time to look to the future 
Just when I was getting 
Used to 
The humdrum 
I realized in the depths of my depression that I really wanted to be someone 
So lets smash the past like a tacky figurine 
On the back page of a supplementary magazine 
But for the time being bump your head to the beat 
Sit back, put your feet up 
And relax' 

Its just another one of those glory days 
Jump out your bed 
Shake your head 
Clear the haze 
Step out your house 
And prepared to be amazed 
It's just another one of those 
Just another one of those 
Just another one of those glory days 
Jump out your bed 
Shake your head 
Clear the haze 
Step out your house 
And prepare to be amazed
