Sometimes they ask me 
If I'm really happy now
I say, sure
I never loved her anyhow
But inside I long for you
And the way it used to be
I look around and there's a
Heartache followin' me.

I always say that
I'm really glad you're gone
I even act like 
I never cared at all
But your memory lingers on
And I'm never really free
I look around and there's a 
Heartache followin' me.

I pawned my ring and everything 
That tied me to the past
I say I never loved her
Never meant for it to last
But I know it's just a game
And the loser's always me
I look around and there's a 
Heartache followin' me...
