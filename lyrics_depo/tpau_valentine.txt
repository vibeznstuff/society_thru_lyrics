Songs for my valentine 
Give the game away 
In rhyme I make mine 
Sing all that I cannot say 
I know mine are the tears I never cry 
I know mine is a love I must deny 

We go our separate ways 
With nothing but a smile 
Hearts break in many ways 
Oh how, you've broken mine 
I know mine are the arms you'll never hold 
I know mine is a love remains untold 

Hey, hey, hey! 
Sunny valentine 
Come on shine 
Your love my way 

Songs for my valentine 
Give the game away 
Come on, take it away yeah 

I know mine are the tears I never cry 
I know mine is a love I must deny 

Hey, hey, hey! 
Sunny valentine 
Come on shine, please shine 
Your love my way 

Oh! Come on and shine 
You've got to shine 
Please shine 
My way, my way 
Oh! Come on now shine 
You've got to shine 
Please shine my way 
It's my turn my way my way 

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Oh come on and shine 
You've got to shine 
Please shine my way...
