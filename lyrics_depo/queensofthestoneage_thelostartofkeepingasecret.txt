Well I've got a secret, I cannot say
A modern movement to give it away
You've got something that I understand
Hold it in tightly, caught on command
Leap of faith, do you doubt?
Cut you in, I just cut you out

Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone

Look for reflections, in your face
Canine devotion, time can't erase
Out on the corner, or locked in your room
I never believe them and I never assume
Stuck in belief, there is a lie
Promise is promise, an eye for an eye
But we've got something to reveal
No one can know how we feel

Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone

Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell

I think you already know
How far I'd go not to say
You know the art isn't gone
And I'm taking a song to the grave

Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone

Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell
