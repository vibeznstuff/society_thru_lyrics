You took my heart from the dark 
I'm falling hard
With you its like you kill the shade my burning pain


I feel like something starting, 
Starting playing in my head 
And its beating loud
I feel like something starting,
starting walking on the edge
'Til we're crashing down


Hit me so hard I don't know where
Starstruck up in the air
Got me got me with my eyes wide open 

If you tell me no I'm not giving up no 
If you tell me no 
I'm not giving up 
No never giving up
Not giving up on love 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 


You're under my skin
Just stay right there 
I want you there
Let the rest fade away
It's just you and me
What was meant to be


I feel like something starting, 
Starting playing in my head 
And its beating loud.
I feel like something starting,
Starting walking on the edge
'Til we're crashing down


Hit me so hard I don't know where
Starstruck up in the air
Got me got me with my eyes wide open 

If you tell me no I'm not giving up no 
If you tell me no 
I'm not giving up 
No never giving up
Not giving up on love 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 


Got me on overload 
I'll be your rock of gold
Can we get overdose on love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 


Hit me so hard I don't know where
Starstruck up in the air
Got me got me with my eyes wide open 

If you tell me no I'm not giving up no 
If you tell me no 
I'm not giving up 
No never giving up
Not giving up on love 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
