I wish I had all you ever wanted
I'd give it right to you
But I don't have it

How could I ever find it,
The strength to let you go
'Cause I don't have it
When will I have it?

And it goes, and it goes on
And it goes on

You won't see me cry
You know I decided
That I'm gonna pull myself together
And find a way to fight it
I'm gonna have to hide it
You won't see me cry
You won't see me cry

I've got no choice but to face it
I have to let you know that I don't like it
My love is good for someone
And it may take some time
But I will find him
Why should I waste it?

When I go,
When I go on
I will go on

You won't see me cry
You know I decided
That I'm gonna pull myself together
And find a way to fight it
Even if I have to hide it
You won't see me cry
You won't see me cry
You won't see me...(oh ah uh)

I finally decided
And I found the way to fight it...

So you won't see me...cry
You won't see me cry
