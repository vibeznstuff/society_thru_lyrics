Love, she sees apart from me
Possessed behind the eyes
Apart from the frightening,
The moaning, the biting
He seemed to be a nice guy

And I know what she thinks when she looks at me,
When she looks with such despair
You're not the only one around here who needs a bit of fresh air


Cause I'm a sad sad post teen
Could have been a love machine
No dream, come clean
Walking like a zombie, like a zombie
And I'm a coal train, fast lane
Caught up in the dirty rain
No pain, no gain
Walking like a zombie, like a zombie

Well, this old place here, man it's falling apart
She's on the road as she goes, but she won't get far
I'm on a show to parole to the toad in the hole
I gotta grow some roots, I gotta prop up the bar

I got bloodshot eyes, and there's blood in my teeth
I got a ripped up jacket and a friend who's a thief
Well I'm a frothin' at the mouth, tryna pull it out
But the fire inside keeps burning, burning out



Hold your own in the situation, don't be afraid to be a friend.
Cause I won't hurt you, girl or leave you a loose end
You make me alive enough to love again
