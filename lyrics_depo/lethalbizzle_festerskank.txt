You might see me in a Lambo
Camo snapback, Rambo
500 horses, Django
2 2 chicken, Nando
You might see me in a Rari
Old school fella, Atari
It's a new dance, no tango
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go

Fester, fester, fester
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go
Fester, fester, fester
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go

It's me and Diztortion
Ending careers, abortion
Do not approach, caution
Cause we're taking everything, no portion
We're in our own lane, M1
Ten man one bottle, you're on them ones
It's a new dance, no tango
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go

Fester, fester, fester
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go
Fester, fester, fester
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go

I do things major
You're irrelevant, pager
I'm a maverick, Sabre
You man are bankrupt, Fazer
Being me is essential
Stay gassed up, petrol
It's a new dance, no tango
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go

Fester, fester, fester
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go
Fester, fester, fester
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go
