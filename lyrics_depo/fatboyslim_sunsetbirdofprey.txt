Bird of prey, bird of prey
Fly in high, fly in high
Bird of prey, bird of prey
In the summer sky, fly in high
Fly in high, fly in high
Take me on your fly, fly in high
Fly in high

Bird of prey, bird of prey
Fly in high, fly in high
Bird of prey, bird of prey
In the summer sky, fly in high

Bird of prey, bird of prey
Jump me pass apart, fly in high
Fly in high

Bird of prey, bird of prey
Fly in high, fly in high
Bird of prey, bird of prey
Jump me pass apart, fly in high
Fly in high, fly in high
Fly in high, fly in high
Fly in high, fly in high
Take me over side, fly in high
