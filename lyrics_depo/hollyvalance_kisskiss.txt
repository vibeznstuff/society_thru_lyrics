Mwah!

When you look at me tell me what do you see 
This is what you get it's the way I am 
When I look at you I wannabe I wannabe
Somewhere close to heaven with Neanderthal man
Don't go, I know you want to touch me
Here there and everywhere 
Sparks fly when we are together 
You can't deny the facts of life

You don't have to act like a star 
Try your moves in the back of the car
Don't you know that we can go far
Because tonight you gonna get my 
Mwah! Mwah!
Don't play the games that you play
Cause You know that I won't run away
Why ain't you asking me to stay
Because tonight I'm gonna give you my 
Mwah! Mwah!
(Uh!)

You could be my baby 
What's your starsign?
Won't you take a step
Into the lion's den?
I can hear my conscience calling me
Calling me
Say I'm gonna be a bad girl again
Why don't you come on over
We can't leave this all undone
Got the devil on my shoulder
There's no place for you to run

You don't have to act like a star 
Try your moves in the back of the car
Don't you know that we can go far
Because tonight you gonna get my 
Mwah! Mwah!
Don't play the games that you play
Cause You know that I won't run away
Why ain't you asking me to stay
Because tonight I'm gonna give you my 
Mwah! Mwah!

If you forget
I'll remind you
If you're paranoid
Look behind you
If You lose your head
I'll find you
Sending you my kiss

If you forget
