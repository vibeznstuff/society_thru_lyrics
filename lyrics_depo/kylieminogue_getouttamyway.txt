What's the worst thing that could happen to you? 
Take a chance tonight and try something new. 
You're getting boring.
You're all so boring, and I don't recognize the zombie you're turning 'to. 
Don't worry cause tonight I got you. 
You can take a seat, do what you normally do. 
I'm about to let you see. 
This is what'll happen if you ain't giving your girl what she needs. 

Leave you, move on 
To a perfect stranger 
You talk I walk 
Wanna feel the danger 
See me with him and it's turnin' you on 
Got me saying getting me back it'd be another song 

Get outta my way 
Got no more to say 
He's takin' your place 
Get outta my way 
Way outta my way 
Got no more to say 
He's takin' your place 
Get outta my way 

Now I got a taste I wanna explore. 
Ain't going to waste, no not anymore. 
You're going hard now, to win my heart but. 
So many times now, you've been comin' up short. 
Don't worry cause tonight I got you. 
You can take a seat do what you normally do. 
I'm about to let you see. 
This is what'll happen if you ain't giving your girl what she needs. 

 
Leave you, move on 
To a perfect stranger 
You talk I walk 
Wanna feel the danger 
See me with him and it's turnin' you on 
Got me saying getting me back it'd be another song 

Get outta my way 
Got no more to say 
He's takin' your place 
Get outta my way 
Way outta my way 
Got no more to say 
He's takin' your place 
Get outta my way 

No I ain't going home cause I wanna stay, but I won't be alone no how no way. 
Now I've showed you what I'm made of. 
This is what'll happen if you ain't giving your girl what she needs. 

 
Leave you, move on 
To a perfect stranger 
You talk I walk 
Wanna feel the danger 
See me with him and it's turnin' you on 
Got me saying getting me back it'd be another song 

Get outta my way 
Got no more to say 
He's takin' your place 
Get outta my way 
Way outta my way 
Got no more to say 
He's takin' your place 
Get outta my way
