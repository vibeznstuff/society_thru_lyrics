Oh, love is the key
Love is the answer
Open your heart

Every day we read about destruction
Can't believe we do what we do
Let's take the world in a new direction
Let every step move us closer to that miracle
That's gonna spread the good news

Love is the key that opens up a new way
Love is the answer we've been searching for
Open your heart if you're looking for a miracle
The miracle is love

Everybody wants to win the wheel of fortune
Say they'll be happy when they do
People looking for their ticket to salvation
Every step should bring us closer to that miracle
We're got to spread the good news

Oh, love is the key that opens up a new way
And love is the answer we've been searching for
So open your heart if you're looking for a miracle

The miracle is to be as children, laughing
To see the goodness love brings
'Cause it's love that makes us one, oh

Love is the key
(Yeah, the key)
Love is the answer we've been searching for
Open your heart
(Open your heart)
It's a miracle, the miracle is love
