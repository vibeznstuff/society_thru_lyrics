I still go riding around town
With the windows down and your feet up on my dash
Got your rays on and my hat's back and we're feeling cool as cash
The night is on, like you ain't even gone
You go sliding through the static trying to find that song you love
Smoke rolling up and you showing up like a dime piece in the dust
You got me stoned, like you ain't even gone

Sunset, twilight, friday night
Round back, chill a dollar fifty miller high life
Headband, peace sign, looking fly, shotgun
Bullet going straight through a street sign

You had diamonds in your eyes when you were smiling
Even pretty when you're crying
If I said I wasn't missing you I'd be lying
But the truth is, girl the truth is

I still go riding around town
With the windows down and your feet up on my dash
Got your rays on and my hat's back and we're feeling cool as cash
The night is on (another moonlight ride), like you ain't even gone
You go sliding through the static trying to find that song you love
Smoke rolling up and you showing up like a dime piece in the dust
You got me stoned (it still feels so right)
Like you ain't even gone (like you ain't even gone)

Midnight calling me looking for trouble
Slipping them should have beens in my head
Got me shootin down an ancient ghost memory double
That blue eyes, summer smoke, sunburn red
He said you were leaving this town, got to runaway
I watched you drive away, and girl you should have chased down

Those diamonds in your eyes when you were smiling
Even pretty when you're crying
If I said I wasn't missing you I'd be lying
Cause the truth is, girl the truth is

I still go riding around town
With the windows down and your feet upon my dash
Got your rays on and my hat's back and we're feeling cool as cash
The night is on (another moonlight ride), like you ain't even gone
You go sliding through the static trying to find that song you love
Smoke rolling up and you showing up like a dime piece in the dust
You got me stoned (it still feels so right)
Like you ain't even gone (like you ain't even gone)
