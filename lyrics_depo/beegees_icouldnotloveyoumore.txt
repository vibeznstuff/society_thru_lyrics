Now that we're alone no more hide and seek
You are the highest dream to me and as you softly sleep
Then I can tell you what it means
Locked in my arms like lovers lie
I will not let you slip away
Is this the summer of them all, is this my night of nights
That you came to stay
Here you are, owner of my heart
Just the way that love should be
And there is something I must say to you
If you promise to believe that it's you I'm living for
And I could not love you more
Seasons may come and season go
But these are the truest words I know
Face to face, eye to eye
This is the summer of our lives
One love that cannot die
Here you are, owner of my soul
Never let you say goodbye
And there is something I must say to you
We leave the world outside
And you have come to me at last, we start
Open up your heart, let my deepest love inside
I'm only doing what I have to do
If you promise to believe that it's you I'm living for
And I could not love you more
