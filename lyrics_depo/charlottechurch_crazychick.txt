I think, I'm gonna need some therapy
Oh babe, I hope you've got a PhD
Won't you let me on your leather couch
I've got a lot, I need to talk about

I think I'm crazy, think I'm stupid
Must have lost my mind
Wonder what I'm thinkin' lovin' you
'Cause boy if you were mine

I'd really go insane
You'd be my favorite thing
I'd go ballistic
Yeah, you're making me a crazy chick

You're drivin' me, to insanity
All the things you do
You make me come unglued
I just can't help myself
I need professional help, help
I need professional help

You've really done it this time
You know you're twisting my mind
You got me acting like a whacked out chick

So I won't be responsible
'Cause I'm really not logical
No I won't be to blame
You know I'm really not sane

I think I'm crazy, think I'm stupid
Must have lost my mind
Wonder what I'm thinkin' lovin' you
'Cause boy if you were mine

I'd really go insane
You'd be my favorite thing
I'd go ballistic
Yeah, you're making me a crazy chick

You're drivin' me, to insanity
All the things you do
You make me come unglued
I just can't help myself
I need professional help, help

Can't get you outta my head
So let me just confess
For those kisses baby, for your love
You drive me crazy, I can't get enough, no

I think I'm crazy, think I'm stupid
Must have lost my mind
Wonder what I'm thinkin' lovin' you
'Cause boy if you were mine

I'd really go insane
You'd be my favorite thing
I'd go ballistic
Yeah, you're making me a crazy chick

You're drivin' me, to insanity
All the things you do
You make me come unglued
I just can't help myself
I need professional help, help

You're drivin' me, to insanity
All the things you do
You make me come unglued
I just can't help myself
I need professional help, help
I need professional help

You're drivin' me, to insanity
All the things you do
You make me come unglued
I just can't help myself
I need professional help, help
I need help
