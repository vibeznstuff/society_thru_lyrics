(Cause I ain't goin out like a sucker, no way
I'm nice right now, I, I feel good
If you have a drink, would you please put it in the air)

That party last night was awfully crazy I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three, wake up at 10
Go out to eat, then do it again, man I love college..

I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip banker's club, and drink Miller Lite
On Thursty Thursday and Tuesday Night Ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice
So fill up my cup
Lets get fucked up (lets get fucked UP!)
I'm next on the table,
Who want what? (What?!)
I am champion, at beer pong,
Allen iverson hakeem olajuwon
Don't even bounce, not in my house
Better hope you make it otherwise you naked 
Time isnt wasted when youre getting wasted
Woke up today and all I could say is, um

That party last night was awfully crazy I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three wake up at 10
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man I love college (hey!)
And I love drinking
And I love women
Man I love college

I cant tell you what I learned from school,
But (nah) I could tell you a story or two, um
Yeah of course I learned some rules
Like dont pass out with your shoes on (get the sharpie!)
And dont leave the house til the booze gone
And dont have sex if shes too gone
When it comes to condoms, put two on (trust me)
And tomorrow night, find a new joint
Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk
Time isnt wasted when youre getting wasted
Woke up today and all I can say is

That party last night was awfully crazy I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three wake up at 10
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man I love college
And I love drinking
And I love women
I love college

Now, if everyboyd would please put their drink
As high as they can, as high as they can
And repeat after me:

Chug chug chug chug chug chug chug
Freshman freshman freshman freshman
Do somethin crazy! Do somethin crazy! Do somethin crazy! Do somethin crazy!
Keg stand Keg stand Keg stand Keg stand

That party last night
(Man I love college, love it, I love it!)
THat party last night

Alright everybody, I gotta head back to class for a little bit

That party last night was awfully crazy I wish we taped it (you konw its going down)
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed (youre all invited)
But my good friends is all I need (bring your friends)
Pass out at three wake up at 10
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man I love college

I love college, do I really have to graduate or can I just stay here for the rest of my life?
