Yo
Come on
Blue
That's right
You know what I'm saying


I think you're bout it bout it
No man could ever doubt it
You're looking so delicious
Could this be the night that we uuuh
Get closer just a little
Take it up another level
Look its just plain and simple
Could this be the night that we uuuh
Don't fight it
Can't hide it
Let's ride this
It just feel so right


Oh, you got the perfect body (uh, huh)
Love the way you're shakin it for me (uh, huh)
can we take it up stairs from the lobby
I don't see nothing in
you and me bubblin
How do we get started
How do we get private
Once we get inside
Its gonna be troubling
You and me bubblin

Yo,yo,yo,come on


Yo, yo, yo, come on
Why don't we get this popping
top floor with no disturbing
Room service in the morning
This will be the night that we uuuh
Elevators waiting open
Don't you think it's time we go in
Can't keep the pent house waiting
This will be the night that we uuuh
clock is tickin'
Times wasting
And you're amazing
It just feel so right


Oh, you got the perfect body (uh, huh)
Love the way you're shakin it for me (uh, huh)
can we take it up stairs from the lobby
I don't see nothing in
you and me bubblin
How do we get started
How do we get private
Once we get inside
Its gonna be troubling
You and me bubblin

Got a body like whoa
Why you waitin over there lets roll
Take it all the way to the top floor
And lets get bubblin' girl
Bubblin' girl
Got a body like whoa
Why you waitin over there lets roll
Take it all the way to the top floor
And lets get bubblin' girl
Bubblin' girl

(ohhh hahahah woooooaaahhhhh)



Oh, you got the perfect body (uh,huh)
Love the way you're shaken that for me (uh,huh)
Lets take it upstairs from the lobby
Idon't see nothin in you and me bubblin'
How do we get started 
How do we get private
Once we get inside 
Its gonna be troublin' 
You and me bubblin'
