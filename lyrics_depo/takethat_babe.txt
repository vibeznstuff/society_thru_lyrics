I come to your door to see you again, 
But where you once stood was an old man instead 
I asked where you'd be, he said "she's moved, on you see 
All I have is a number you'd better ask her not me" 
So I picked up the phone and dialled your number 
Not sure to put it down or speak 
Then I voice I once knew answered in a sweet voice 
She said hello then paused before I began to speak 

Babe I'm here again, I tell you I'm here again 
Where have you been? 
Babe, I'm back again, I tell you I'm back again 
Where have you been? 

You held your voice well, there were tears I could tell 
But where were you now? Was you gonna tell me in time? 
Just give me a town and I'll be straight down 
Got so much to tell you about where I have been 
As I walk down your road, can't wait to be near you 
Can't keep the feeling in inside 
As I stand at your door you answered in a sweet voice 
You said hello then pause before I begin to speak 

Babe I'm here again, I tell you I'm here again 
Where have you been? 
Babe, I'm back again, I tell you I'm back again 
Where have you been? 

Just as I looked away, I saw a face behind you 
A little boy stood at your door 
And as I looked again I saw his face was shining 
He had my eyes, he had my smile 

Babe I'm here again, I tell you I'm here again 
Where have you been? 
Babe, I'm back again, I tell you I'm back again 
Where have you been?
