Girl come through and let's do what we do in your imagination
When I'm gone, show me how you pretend
How do you bend your knees?
How do you arch your back?
How do you scream my name when we're in your imagination?

I know that you hate how much I be on the road
And how I be working late all night at the studio
I know you're a woman and I know you've got needs
But I know that you never, never sneak out on me

So how do you do it when it be like three o'clock in the morning?
And how do you touch it when you in that bed all alone?
Show me, show me, show me 

Girl come through and let's do what we do in your imagination
When I'm gone, show me how you pretend
Girl you got to show me.
How do you bend your knees? (How do you bend your knees?)
How do you arch your back? (How do you arch your back yeah)
How do you scream my name when we're in your imagination?

Do I be all on the top of you? Do you be on the bottom?
And do we use protection? If we do you know I got em
Do we skip the foreplay? Tell me, do we sixty-nine?
Do you prefer a quickie, or do we go hard all night?

I want to know what turns you on. I swear I'm dying to know baby.
So I can be all that and more.

Girl come through and let's do what we do in your imagination
When I'm gone, show me how you pretend
How do you bend your knees?
How do you arch your back?
How do you scream my name when we're in your imagination?
