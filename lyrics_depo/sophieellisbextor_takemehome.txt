Take me home, take me home
I know another place to be
Take me home, take me home
You deserve a girl like me
Come on I know somewhere
You can unwind
We can just disappear
Now's the time
Take me home, take me home
Only fair I get my way
Take me home, take me home
Oh it's going to happen anyway
I know what's good for you
Don't pass me by
I will look after you
You'll be fine
I'm in heaven I'll show you heaven it's so much heaven
let's make a move
lets leave this world behind
I know you approve by the look in your eyes
I'm in heaven I'll show you heaven It's so much heaven
take me home take me home
I will show you where to walk
take me home take me home
baby let the people talk
we'll get away from here
I'm reading your mind
We can just disappear
now's the time
I'm in heaven, I'll show you heaven take me home
Oh, take me home
Oh, take me home
In this moment one night with you
all alone with nothing to loose
let's make a move
let's leave this world behind
I know you approve by the look in your eyes
I'm in heaven I'll show you heaven it's so much heaven
Take me home, take me home
Now's the time to follow me
take me home
come and live what ought to be
take me home take me home
