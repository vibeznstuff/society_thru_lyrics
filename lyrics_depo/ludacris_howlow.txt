And if she really get low, then I'ma shoot a video and put it all on TV
(Oh!!) 'Cause I like that French vanilla (French vanilla) 
and the caramel (and the caramel)
But when it comes to chocolate (when it comes to chocolate),

Asian persuasion, no discrimination, I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them butter Rican pecan peanut butter cups like Reese's Pieces (OH!!)
'Cause I think you a superstar, wit a ass like that you GOTTA blow
Befo' you make it big, there’s just one thing that I gotta knoooooow...




Drop it, hit it, dump it, split it
