Please don't go
Please don't go
Don't you know that I love you so
Say you're mine
And give me tonight
Let's stay together
Please don't go
Please don't go
You're the only angel I know
You were sent from heaven above
To love me forever
Don't go
Don't go
If you leave me
You'll let a good thing fall apart
If you deceive me
You'll leave a pain inside my heart
I really need you
Just like the air I need to breathe
I'll stand beside you
I'll never leave
Please don't go
Please don't go
Don't you know that I love you so
Say you're mine
And give me tonight
Let's stay together
Please don't go
Please don't go
You're the only angel I know
You were sent from heaven above
To love me forever
Don't go
Don't go
If you leave me
You're gonna spoil a dream we share
If you leave me
I'm gonna miss the way you cared
I will try harder
I'll make you fall in love again
And I'll be faithful
Until the end
Please don't go
Please don't go
You're the only angel I know
You were sent from heaven above
To love me forever
Don't go
If you leave me
I'm gonna search the world for you
If you leave me
Sweet memories will shine on through
I'll always love you
No matter what you do or say
Cause when I touch you
Light touches the day
Please don't go
Please don't go
I don't wanna be all alone
Say you're mine
And give me tonight
Let's stay together
Please don't go
Please don't go
You're the only angel I know
You were sent from heaven above
To love me forever
Don't go
