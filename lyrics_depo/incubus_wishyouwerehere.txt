I dig my toes into the sand. 
The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket. 
I lean against the wind, pretend that i am weightless and in this moment i am happy.


I wish you were here 
I wish you were here 
I wish you were here 
I wish you were here.

I lay my head onto the sand. 
The sky resembles a backlit canopy with holes punched in it. 
I'm counting ufo's. 
I signal them with my lighter 
and in this moment i am happy, happy. 



The world's a roller coaster and I am not strapped in. 
Maybe I should hold with care,but my hands are busy in the air.
