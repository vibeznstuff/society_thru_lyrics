I can go anyway (Way I Choose)
I can live anyhow (Win or lose)
I can go anywhere (For something new)
Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere I choose

I can do anything (Right or wrong)
I can talk anyhow (And get along)
Don't care anyway (I'll never lose)
Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere I choose

Nothing gets in my way
Not even locked doors
Don't follow the lines that's been layed before
I get along
Anyway I dare
Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere...

I can go anyway (Way I choose)
I can live anyhow (Win or lose)
I can do anything (For something new)
Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere I choose

Any way, any way I choose yeah! Any way I wanna go! Or when I wanna do myself!
Do myself, do myself yeah! Any way, any way I choose!
Yeah yeah, I never lose the way I choose! The way I choose! The way I choose...
