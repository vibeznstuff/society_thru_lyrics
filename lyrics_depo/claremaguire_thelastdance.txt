Today I feel the mood
And I don’t feel like talking oh I
I wasn’t ready to lose you
You’re the first man to move me, yeah
You helped me feel alive
Got me up from 9 to 5 oh I
I could get through those days
With you on my mind, yeah

Got to try move on but I promise you
I will kiss your crown when life takes me down

I’ll save my last dance
For you my friend
I’ll save my last dance
For you my friend

Another face in the crowd
Oh people love to move now oh I
I just can’t feel the beat
'Cause my heart's fallen out

Got to try move on but I promise you
I will kiss your crown when life takes me down

I’ll save my last dance
For you my friend
I’ll save my last dance
For you my friend

I’ve got my life in my hands
And your love in my heart
I’ve got my life in my hands
And your love in my heart
I’ll save my last dance
For you my friend

And it seems I’ve lived my life
With you as my rhythm, yeah
And I know I’ll find my feet after dreaming

I’ll save my last dance
For you my friend
I’ll save my last dance
For you my friend

I’ve got my life in my hands
And your love in my heart
I’ve got my life in my hands
And your love in my heart
I’ll save my last dance
For you my friend

I’ve got my life in my hands
And your love in my heart


Today I feel the mood
I wasn’t ready to lose you
Today I feel the mood
I wasn’t ready to lose you
