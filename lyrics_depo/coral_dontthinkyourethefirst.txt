Don't think you're the first, in the whole universe
To follow your heart or gaze at the stars
To stare at the night through the clear daylight
Don't think you're the first, in the whole universe
To feel sorrow or shame as you walk in the rain

Do I love you? Yes I love you, what I wouldn't tell you

Don't think you're the first, in the whole universe
To be caught in the act, numbered and racked
Put in your place, made to feel like a fake
Don't think you're the first, in the whole universe
To be untouched by the tide, think your one of a kind

Do I love you? Yes I love you, what I wouldn't tell you
Don't think you're the first,

Don't think you're the first, in the whole universe
To dance with the light, from the meat to the might
As the birds in the trees sing their sweet melodies
Don't think you're the first, in the whole universe
To hear a thousand violins as the trial begins

Do I love you? Yes I love you, what I wouldn't tell you

Don't think you're the last, to be tied to the mast
While you watch from afar as your world falls apart
You hang on for help as the rest help themselves
Don't think you're the last, to be tied to the past
While your future's controlled by the presence untold

Do I love you? Yes I love you, what I wouldn't tell you
Don't think you're the first
