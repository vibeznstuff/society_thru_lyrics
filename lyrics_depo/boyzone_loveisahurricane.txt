Whoa
I lie in bed but I can't sleep
On the ledge but I can't leap
Even doing nothing is so hard to do
To do
On my tongue but I can't speak
The simple things are sometimes deep
I only hope that this means something to you
To you
I want to spend my life with you right by my side
Cause when you kiss my lips I see lighting in the sky
That's like 
One step forward and two steps back
Cause love is like a hurricane
When you're with me I'm on track
We're riding on the crazy train
I'll be fine
If you're mine at the end of the line
Butterflies I want to keep
I try to laugh but I just weep
There's something about you gets me just so deep inside, inside
I want to spend tonight just looking in your eyes
I feel like a millionaire but I don't have a dime
It's like one step forward and two steps back
Love is like a hurricane
When you're with me I'm on track
We're riding on the crazy train
I'll be fine
If you're mine at the end of the line
Let me love you
Won't you let me love you
Won't you
You got me lovin you
yeah you got me loving you
Oh you got me loving you
Girl you got me loving you
One step forward and two steps back
You're love is like a hurricane
When you're with me I'm on track
We're riding the crazy train
I'll be fine
If you're mine at the end of the line
