Sorry, didn't notice you there
But then again you didn't notice me
So we'll remain passers by
Until the next time we speak
I hope that I can make you mine
'For another man steals your heart
And once this beauty is mine
I swear we will never be apart

Walks by me every day
Her and love are the same
The woman that's stolen my heart
And beauty is her name
I'm hoping I can make you mine
'For another man steals your heart
And once this beauty is mine
I swear we will never be apart

It didn't take much time to think about
But I didn't want to move too fast
Cause I knew that when I saw you again
That I wouldn't wanna let you pass
Cause my eyes have seen the glory
In the coming of your smile
So I swear if you ever come 'round again
Please stay for a while

Walks by me every day
Her and love are the same
The woman that's stolen my heart
And beauty is her name

I'm hoping I can make you mine
'For another man steals your heart
And once this beauty is mine
I swear that we'll never be apart

You are so beautiful
When I'm down and out
I never seem to get tired
Tired of your love
Cause you are wonderful

You're wonderful
I'm just dying to make you see
Anything you want inside your heart
You can find right here inside of me

Walks by me every day
Her and love are the same
The woman that's stolen my heart
And beauty is her name

I'm hoping I can make you mine
'For another man steals your heart
And once this beauty is mine
I swear we will never be apart

Walks by me every day
Her and love are the same
The woman that's stolen my heart
And beauty is her name

I'm hoping I can make you mine
'For another man steals your heart
And once this beauty is mine
I swear we will never be apart

Walks by me every day
Her and love are the same
The woman that's stolen my heart
And beauty is her name
