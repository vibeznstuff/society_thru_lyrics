I can't see through this haze,
My mind has been re-arranged.
Yeah it's all gone up in smoke
And stuck to my throat and left me broke.

I don't seem too much to mind,
I seem to get along just fine.
I make sure that I drink from my cup
I got two eyes that look and I follow my foot.

Ahhh yeah,
I'm a waster.
Yeah sure I smoke a little dope.
Ahhh yeah,
I'm a waster 'til I die.

You might think that I've my shoulders in the air,
I gotta scratch them with receptors instead.
I live in trees but I just get stuck
I watch the sun go down, then I get up.

I choose my outfit from the clothes on the floor,
I'm drinking cold tea then I head for my door.
I'm going down all those back alleyways,
You know, you ain't gonna see me again.

Ahhh yeah,
I'm a waster.
I want to poke before I choke.
Ahhh yeah,
I'm a waster, sure sometime.

Politicians, V.I.Ps,
You ain't what the world needs.
Future marching, setting suns,
We ain't the ones.
Oh please, God help me.

Ahhh yeah,
I'm a waster.
Yes sure I smoke a little dope.
Ahhh yeah,
I'm a waster 'til I die,
'til I die.
