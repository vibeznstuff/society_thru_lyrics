I had to look inside
This fragile heart of mine
To find exactly what it was you saw

I had to put myself back in the firing line
To take the shot that knocked me to the floor

I was down, losing faith, oh I was lost in the crowd
You brought me round

How did you find me?
You came out of nowhere like lightening
It’s kind of amazing how you found me
Through all the noise somehow

I was pulling empty pales
Out of the wishing well
Only holy water breaks the spell
I had to pinch myself
‘Cause I knew all too well
The stairway to heaven oh it starts in hell

I was down, but somehow an angel heard my sound
And brought me round

How did you find me?
You came out of nowhere like lightening
It’s kind of amazing how you found me
Through all the noise somehow
How did you see me?
Broke through the darkness and you reached me
It’s kind of amazing how you found me
Through all the strangers somehow

Faith and a little patience for this heart of mine
Though I would stay here waiting for the end of time

How did you find me?
You came out of nowhere like lightening
It’s kind of amazing how you found me
Through all the noise somehow
How did you see me?
Broke through the darkness and you reached me
It’s kind of amazing how you found me
Through all the strangers somehow

Through all the strangers somehow, somehow
