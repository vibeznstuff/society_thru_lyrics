He swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back 
in Atlantic City
There's not even a demon
in Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise
As I walk down the aisle

And I'm gone gone gone
Now I'm older than movies
Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall

And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone 
through a crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking

Two young men dancing under the lamplight
Shaking their sex and their bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked and new
Like a bad tempered child 
On a rain slicked street

And I'm gone gone gone
And I'm older than movies
Oh let me dance dance dance
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall
And I'm gone

And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, 
through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking

And I'm gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And I'm gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels 
And I'm gone, 
through a crack in the past 
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
