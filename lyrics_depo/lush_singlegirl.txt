Single girl I don't wanna be a single girl
Single girl I don't wanna be a single girl

Don't wanna be on my own again tonight
Don't wanna put out the light

Single girl who would wanna be a single girl

Don't wanna talk to myself again tonight
Don't wanna put out the light

When you abandoned me
Well it was heaven-sent
When I abandoned you
It was what you meant
Well it was you that knew it
And it was you that went

Having changed our minds it was meant to be

Don't wanna clean up your mess again tonight
Don't have to be in a fight
I'm going to what I want again tonight
Living without you - it's alright

Single girl I just wanna be a single girl
