I was taught that education is the only way to make it
Then how'd I get so much money inside my savings?
My teachers never saw the heights that I was fucking aiming
Did the man who invented college, go to college? Hm, okay then
Am I the only one that noticed humans on the same shit?
Y'all thoughts are sailing on the same ship
And if that's the case, then that's the reason that you ain't shit
Let me enlighten you my niggas, just let your brain drift
First of all, the best type of marketing is marketing that doesn't feel like marketing
It makes the people feel like they a part of it
And when it's done right, corporations think its marvelous
They feed us these ideas and then we place 'em in our hearts to sit
It's why players are good at getting chicks
It's why Nike is good at selling kicks
It's why Disney is loved by all the kids
Why McDonald's owners are super rich, we too blinded to ever see 'em pitch
See when this happens we take our health, wealth, lives and just hand them off
Thinking that we did this from organic thoughts
I know you seen parents trick kids with candy, toys, and Santa Claus
The same method is used to trap adults
But instead of candy it's with money, religion, drugs and alcohol
Mention that shit and it's gon' arouse us all
I done seen niggas get into fights over cigarettes like a pack of dogs
They get you hooked and then they laugh at y'all

I really hate to break it to you but your life's being played with
You have not witnessed the world cause you're stuck in the Matrix
Everything we have been taught was all a lie
Open your eyes, open your mind, and fly

Man, can't you see we're robots who know not what we do when we got no shot
In the real world until we climb out of this ice cold box
Your whole life has been part of a whole plot
To keep you at the bottom while they on top, stay quiet, then they won't stop
They always tryna show us what we don't got
They do it to all of us 'til we finally break and go cop a gold watch
Knowing we need the cash for rent
My ass is sick just thinking about how rich and powerful all these bastards get
They package ideas like it's oxygen
They make us feel like if we ain't got it, we fucked and we cannot fit in
This fucking system is not your friend
And understand they controlling your thoughts cause they got a lot to win
Niggas get turned away when I mention this
Ignorance is bliss but I don't give a fuck, I won't censor shit
The Matrix is real when you done entered it
It's way too intricate for you to ever realize that, you fucking simpleton

I really hate to break it to you but your life's being played with
You have not witnessed the world cause you're stuck in the Matrix
Everything we have been taught was all a lie
Open your eyes, open your mind, and fly

Yo, fuck Hollywood, fuck all these reality shows
Making us feel lame unless we blowing stacks on new clothes
Making us feel like we ain't cool unless we have a few hoes
Making us feel like we ugly, unless we have a new nose
I see naturally beautiful women get Botox, fake tits
Fake lips, they so brainwashed and it doesn't make sense
Focus on your life and the path you're pursuing
Cause y'all too busy worried about what Kim Kardashian's doing
Check it, most of this shit that you sheep are watching on television
Is fake as fuck and is not real, I rebel against it
It's the Devil's business, they just reel y'all in
If they say it, we do it, yo, I'm tryna tell y'all man
The system created the stereotype for the Black image
That's why my people are scared to be different, why don't you get it?
I'm done practicing these ridiculous rituals
It's time I become a real individual and just do me

I really hate to break it to you but your life's being played with
You have not witnessed the world cause you're stuck in the Matrix
Everything we have been taught was all a lie
Open your eyes, open your mind, and fly

Use your mind, be yourself
And, and nobody else but you
You and the meaning of life has no rules, no rules, no rules
Fly away
Fly away
Fly, and fly, away
Life's too short just live it
The world is just complete
Just go and get it, it's beautiful
