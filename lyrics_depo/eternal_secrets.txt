I wanna know about all of your secrets
And all that, that you've been keeping
Oh, tell me your secrets 

Tell me some of your secrets, your innermost thoughts
Don't hold it back, let it all out
I wanna hear every single part
I wanna know all about you, don't hide
Tell me your secrets 

I wanna know about all of your secrets
And all that, that you've been keeping
Oh, tell me your secrets 

Tell me one of your secrets
Leave nothing out
Try and tell me in detail that'll remove every single doubt
I wanna know all about it, don't make it up
Tell me your secret 

I wanna know about all of your secrets
And all that, that you've been keeping
Oh, tell me your secrets 

Tell me all about all of your secrets
And all that, that you've been keeping
Oh, tell me your secret 

Sing it to me 

I wanna remove all doubt my baby
Take a look inisie
I need to see your heart, your feelings
I wanna make it right 

I wanna remove all doubt, my baby
Take a look inside
I need to see your heart, my baby
I wanna make it right 

I wanna know about all of your secrets
And all that, that you've been keeping
