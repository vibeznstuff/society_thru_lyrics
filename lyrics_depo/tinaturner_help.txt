WHEN I WAS YOUNGER 
SO MUCH YOUNGER THAN TODAY
I NEVER NEEDED ANYBODIES
HELP IN ANY WAY
AND NOW THOSE DAYS ARE GONE
I`M NOT SO SELF ASSURED
AND NOW I FIND
I`VE CHANGED MY MIND
I`VE OPENED UP THE DOORS


HELP ME IF YOU CAN
I`M FEELING DOWN
AND I DO APPRECIATE
YOU BEING `ROUND
OH HELP ME IF YOU CAN
I`M FEELING DOWN
WON`T YOU PLEASE, PLEASE HELP ME

AND NOW MY LIFE HAS CHANGED
IN OH SO MANY WAYS
MY INDEPENDENCE SEEMS TO
VANISH IN THE HAZE
AND EVERY NOW AND THEN
I FEEL SO INSECURE
AND NOW I JUST NEED YOU LIKE
I NEVER DID BEFORE
