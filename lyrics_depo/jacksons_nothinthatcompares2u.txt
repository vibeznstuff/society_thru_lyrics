I'll give my all and all
To you and no other woman
Never will I let you down
Never will I do wrong

And I'll give my heart and soul
And hope that you will never let me go
Never had a woman so fine

And if I give my love completely
(Will u love me in return)
And if it's in your heart then show me
Then you'll never have to worry
Cause I'll always be around


Nothin'
And I do mean nothin'
Nothin' that compares 2 u
You're so fine that I'm scared of you

I'll give my everything
To you and have no other
Ever since I fell in love
Never have I been down

You've been the only one
Promise my one and only lover
Never has my love been so sound
And if you give your heart completely

I will never let you go
And I will love you girl so sweetly
You will never have to worry
Cause I'll always be around



And if I give my love completely
Will you love me in return
And if it's in your heart then show me
You will never have to worry
Cause I'll always be around
