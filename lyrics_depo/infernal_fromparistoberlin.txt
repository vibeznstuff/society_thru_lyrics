From Paris to Berlin,
And every disco I get in,
My heart is pumping for love,
Pumping for love,
'Cause when I'm thinking of you,
And all the things we could do,
My heart is pumping for love,
You left me longing for you

From Paris to Berlin,
And every disco I get in,
My heart is pumping for love,
Pumping for love,
'Cause when I'm thinking of you,
And all the things we could do,
My heart is pumping for love

Patience is a game,
And every night I say your name,
Hoping that you'll answer
'Cause I'm going insane.
It's quite along time ago,
You brought me out of control,
Hungry for you love
And like I know what that might be

From Paris to Berlin,
And every disco I get in,
My heart is pumping for love,
Pumping for love,
'Cause when I'm thinking of you,
And all the things we could do,
My heart is pumping for love
You left me longing for you 

Teasing was the thing
And now I just can't let it go
Maiden you were something no-one else needs to know
I guess I'm thinking of you,
Like I would know what to do
If and when I found you, but I don't
Have got no clue

From Paris to Berlin,
And every disco I get in,
My heart is pumping for love,
Pumping for love.
'Cause when I'm thinking of you,
And all the things we could do,
My heart is pumping for love,
You left me longing for you, 

Who-whoa-o
Who-whoa-o
Who-whoa-o
Who-whoa-o
Who-whoa-o
Who-whoa-o
Who-whoa-o

From Paris to Berlin,
And every disco I get in,
My heart is pumping for love,
Pumping for love,
'Cause when I'm thinking of you,
And all the things we could do,
My heart is pumping for love,
You left me longing for you

From Paris to Berlin,
And every disco I get in,
My heart is pumping for love,
Pumping for love,
'Cause when I'm thinking of you,
And all the things we could do,
My heart is pumping for love,
You left me longing for you
