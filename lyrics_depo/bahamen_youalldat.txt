I was up with the moon, and down with the stars,
And the party was carrying on (party!).
All the girls were outside, kicking sand, sipping on mohitos (ooh!),
And all the boys were standing around, dancing the congo (hey-yeah-hey...).
And then, woah, there she was, I think she's looking fine (no way),
Hey! I know what I see when I see it (right).
Watch me go down there and do my talk,
Damn it, girl, I just got something to say.


Tell me will it be okay if I say...
You got it! You all dat! You got it! Baby, you tow me away.

All the girls started laughing at me (a ha ha ha ha ha!),
I had to make a quick retreat, get ready for round two (bong).
Coz my love is like a bomb, about to explode,
And only she can light my fuel.
So I'm walking (woah), I'm talking (way),
Damn, girl, I just got something to say.



Dance with men, you dance with moves,
So I dropped to my knees and prayed (yeah).
Please, God, just one time, give me a night of ecstasy just for two.
Until I opened my eyes and to my surprise,
My goddess of love was standing there, and she says.

Yeah, baby, got something to tell?
Well, c'mon, hurry up, I don't got all day.
You got the hots for me, I can see,
But you gotta give it all you got to get me.
So c'mon, c'mon, what you got? Give it to me,
If not, you're not one of the guys who wanna do me, huh.
I'll show you how it's done,
You gotta be bold, or you ain't gonna get none.



I know your head is for the time of day,
I'm one, since you won, after you say what you wanna say.
Tick-tock, the time is ticking,
I'm under pressure, I'm nervous - Chicken.
Hold up, girl, listen up, you're my dope,
You're all dat, you definately got it, girl.
What you want? What you need?
What I gotta say? Give me your hand, I'm gonna take you away - Okay.

You got it! Baby, you tow me away.

I was up with the moon, and down with the stars,
And me and my baby was going to our own party.
