I'm lost in your love
When I wake up
The first thing I do is think of you

Lost in your love
When I wake up
The first thing I do is think of you

Lost in your love

When I wake up

Lost in your love

Lost in your love

Lost in your love

Lost in your love

I, I don't need you
And something is wrong
I, I don't leave you
I've got to hold this strong

I'm lost in your love
When I wake up
The first thing I do is think of you

I'm lost in your love
When I wake up
The first thing I do is think of you

Lost in your love
When I wake up
I, I don't need you

When I wake up
I, I don't need you

Lost in your love
I'm lost in love
Lost in your love

Lost in your love
Lost in your love
I, I don't need you
Something is wrong
I, I don't need you

Lost in your love
Lost in your love
I'm lost in your love
Lost in your love

Lost in your love
Lost in your love
I'm lost in your love
Lost in your love

Lost in your love

Lost in your love
