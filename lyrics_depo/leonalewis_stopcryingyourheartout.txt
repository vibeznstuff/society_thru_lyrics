Hold up... hold on... don't be scared,
You'll never change what's been and gone.
May your smile... Shine on...
Don't be scared,
Your destiny may keep you warm.

Cause all of the stars have faded away,
Just try not to worry,
You'll see them some day.
Take what you need,
And be on your way,
And stop crying your heart out.

Get up... (Get Up) Come on...
(Come On) why you scared? (I'm not scared)
You'll never change what's been and gone.

Cause all of the stars have faded away,
Just try not to worry,
You'll see them some day.
Take what you need,
And be on your way,
And stop crying your heart out.

Cause all of the stars have faded away,
Just try not to worry,
You'll see them some day.
Just take what you need,
And be on your way,
And stop crying your heart out.

When all of the stars were faded away,
Just try not to worry,
You'll see us some day.
Just take what you need,
And be on your way,
And stop crying your heart out.

Stop crying your heart out.
