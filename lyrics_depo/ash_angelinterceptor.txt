I stayed in last night
I wasn't feeling alright
I knew it couldn't last
I started thinking of you
And I wished we could be dancing in the dark
(Really slow)
Oh, it's good to know
Tomorrow you are coming home
(I won't be so alone)
I feel heaven in you, don't you know
I feel heaven in you, don't you know I feel heaven in you
Oh, it's true
I can't let go
I miss you, oh you know

Sitting alone
With the TV on
I fell asleep
I was hoping you'd call
And I dreamed we could be dancing in the dark
(Really slow)
Oh, it's good to know,
Tomorrow you are coming home
(I won't be so alone)
I feel heaven in you, don't you know-
I feel heaven in you, don't you know-
I feel heaven in you
Oh it's true, I can't let go
I miss you oh you know

Angel Interceptor- Apollo 21- Uri Gagarin
Flew into the sun
The angels in heaven look down
Where he lay
Oh tomorrow you are coming home...
I feel heaven in you, don't you know-
I feel heaven in you, don't you know-
I feel heaven in you
Oh it's true, I can't let go
I miss you oh you know
