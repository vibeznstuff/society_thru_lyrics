Tonight, I felt stronger, inside of your ways,
It takes a lot to get home, but it's OK when the light is always on

I just want you to understand, there's no need to keep waiting.
Another day in another hand, it could be so different.
A letter to me, your wasting time,
You know you could be, yeah, you could shine
But tonight you'll get it right,
You will make a difference...


Tonight, tonight, tonight,
I feel stronger,
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,
If i could see through, even so far away
Its all you need too, make it through another day.

Surprise, scream your heart out,
In time, you will have doubts
Today it all seems too strong
If only you tried you would move on

I just want you to understand, there's no need to keep waiting.
Another day in another hand, it could be so different.
A letter to me, your wasting time,
You know you could be, yeah, you could shine
But tonight you'll get it right,
You will make a difference...
