Woah… yeah yeah yeah
Courtney!
Rip…
Whatever man, everyone does that ad-lib… ha!
Now girls, what we gonna call these guys that don’t like it?
The Waste Men!


You can adore me on Sunday, as Sunday’s my only day off
You know that I don’t wanna hang with no stranger.
After I’m done I want gone, but I have to say
All your chocolate got me meltin’ baby,
Got me meltin’, oh my days, yeah!
Let me give you double helpings, you’ll be screaming
Baby baby baby baby… uh uh!


Oh oh oh, turn it up and I’ll go
Cause I won’t need you no more (no!)
Your place, fine but I ain’t got the time
Why don’t you hurry up, yeah hurry up, yeah hurry up!
Love me…


You better call your friend Johnny, you wanna hope he’s in town
Cause you know when you blow that I don’t want no… d-d-d-d-danger!
Without him it ain’t going down, but I have to say…
Milky bar kid got me melting
Sugar with that geek chic all the way
Do your thing and don’t be speaking not unless it’s dirty, dirty filthy dirty!


Oh oh oh, turn it up and I’ll go
Cause I won’t need you no more (no!)
You play fine but I ain’t got the time
Why don’t you hurry up, yeah hurry up, yeah hurry up!
Love me…


It’s Travie!
Listen…
I don’t know what you take me as
But it’s obvious your girlfriends got you gassed
I’ve spent most my life chasing.
Now I’m tired,
So we gonna have to make this fast!

Second door, hit the e-bray
The D fiver, we’re gonna make a freaky tale,
kiss me off right here
I’m a freak but hey,
 with a god, I’ma leash ya tail
Am at least let’s say,
Matter of fact, I’d rather…
To deal with another basket case
Ah what a waste of a fat booty!
I used to bag her when 

Listen mate, I don’t mean to brag
I’m telling you I’ma be the best you’ve had
So let’s roll! Don’t be taking your time
Get it up, poke it in, blow my mind!
Blow my mind….
And the rest - explicits!
Courtney!
Ha-ha I’m joking you know I don’t do -!


Oh oh oh, turn it up and I’ll go
Cause I won’t need you no more (no!)
Your place, fine but I ain’t got the time
Why don’t you hurry up, yeah hurry up, yeah hurry up!

Where’s the music gone?
Love me…

Why don’t you…
Love me
Ohhh

Hey Diddle Diddle, my cat needs a fiddle!
