I have this fantasy 
You come back and you forgive me 
Oh I'm so sorry now 
I hear this melody 
Our tryst in rhapsody 
And I am listening 
I never thought I'd see the day when you and me 
We'd be so far apart 
And I miss you so much now 
But I know there's no way back to yesterday 

I will be with you 
You're here in my heart 
But if you never come back again 
We'll never be far apart 
I miss you so much 
Wherever you are 
But if you never come back again 
We'll never be far apart 

Here in my deepest dream 
Running through another scene 
I win your love again 
And no, it doesn't bother me 
The time I spend in imagery 
Well it's how I live 
You see, I don't believe that we tried 
Everything before our love died 
And I just can't forget 
Oh, is the one chance all we get 

I will be with you 
You're here in my heart 
But if you never come back again 
We'll never be far apart 
I miss you so much 
Wherever you are 
But if you never come back again 
We'll never be far apart 

Now I have such memories 
But I don't like to resurrect them 
Oh you know they hurt me so much now 
And I know there's no way you'll be coming home 

I will be with you 
You're here in my heart 
But if you never come back again 
We'll never be far apart 
I miss you so much 
Wherever you are 
But if you never come back again 
We'll never be far apart 

I will be with you 
You're here in my heart 
But if you never come back again 
We'll never be far apart 
I miss you so much 
Wherever you are 
But if you never come back again 
We'll never be far apart
