Above the feeling 
This is revealing 
Boy i didnt know you cared 
Mustve been up on the weekend 
In the club freakin 
Boy i could see you stare 
You were lookin right at me 
Lookin right back 
We knew there was something there 
And i know you knew that if we did do this 
It would be an affair 

Cos my mans at home 
Lookin at the finger his ring goes on 
He got trust in me 
How'm i gonna live with myself if i cheat 

Dumb diggi-diggi-di dumb di-dumb 
And 'though I know it would be fun to get some 
Gotta run now, gotta go 
Gotta get home 
Cos my baby's boy's on his own 
Better be Dumb diggi-diggi-di dumb di-dumb 
And 'though I know it would be fun to get some 
Gotta run now 
I gots ta get home, 
My baby boy's on his own, 

Up on the dancefloor 
Then ya go ask for a night in with me 
But ya know that aint gon' happen 
I wont get trapped in 
This, see, it just aint me 
And you can try, seduce me 
But its no use, see 
I'm in love with my baby 
And I wont let you in 
Mess up and move in 
To do that I'd be crazy 

Cos my mans at home 
Lookin at the finger his ring goes on 
He got trust in me 
How'm I gonna live with myself if I cheat 

Dumb diggi-diggi-di dumb di-dumb don't want none
And 'though I know it would be fun to get some 
Gotta run now, gotta go 
Gotta get home 
Cos my baby's boy's on his own 
Better be Dumb diggi-diggi-di dumb di-dumb don't want none
And 'though I know it would be fun to get some 
Gotta run now 
I gots ta get home, 
My baby boy's on his own, 

Theres no way that im gon' play 
I dont care what you gon' say 
Even though you make me crazy 
I wont risk losing my baby 
Theres no way that im gon' play 
I dont care what you gon' say 
Even though you make me crazy 
I wont risk losing my baby

That'd be Dumb diggi-diggi-di dumb da dont want none 
And 'though I know it would be fun to get some 
Gotta run now, gotta go 
Gotta get home 
Cos my baby's boy's on his own 
Better be Dumb diggi-diggi-di dumb da dont want none
And 'though I know it would be fun to get some 
Gotta go now 
I gots ta get home, 
My baby boy's on his own,
