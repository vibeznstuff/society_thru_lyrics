Life is such a funny thing 
You never know what it'll bring 
You know I'm just takin' it day by day 
For you it comes so easily 
For me it's just a fantasy 
'Cause nothin', nothin' ever comes my way I see you there, 
I watch you fly If I could be you I would touch the sky 
But here I am, and there you are 
Don't you know it's driving me 
So crazy 
 
I think I'm going crazy, 
Can't take it anymore 
Got one thing on my mind all the time 
And it's driving me crazy, I think i'm going crazy 
And I don't know what I'm doing I just can't take your grace in my face 
'Cause it's driving me crazy 
You do just what you wanna do 
Everybody wants to be with you 
It's something that I just don't understand 
I don't believe you know what you got 
And that's what puts me over the top I'm running 
I'm running just as fast as I can I see you there, 
I watch you fly If I could be you I would touch the sky 
But here I am, and there you are 
Don't you know it's driving me 
So crazy
