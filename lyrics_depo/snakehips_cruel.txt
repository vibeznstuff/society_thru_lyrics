Cop radio screaming
Noise and tears
There's war/death on the TV
And then there's you...
It's fucked, it's crazy
I can't concentrate
I just see your outline
Mhmm

Back where we left off
I watch you take your dress off
I been by myself remembering you
How your body hurts me
Looping round like CCTV
In all of this bitterness
You stay so sweet

It's such a cruel world
I'm saving all my love for you, girl
In such a cruel world
Maybe I found something good, girl

Some prick at the party
All scripts and boasts
A dead eyed actress girl
And then there's you...
Venus in Converse
You put a spell on me
And you're locking up the bathroom door for us...

Back where we left off
I watch you take your dress off
I been by myself remembering you
How your body hurts me
Looping round like CCTV
In all of this bitterness
You stay so sweet

It's such a cruel world
I'm saving all my love for you girl
In such a cruel world
Maybe I found something good, girl

Who do you love? Who do you love?
Who do you love? Who do you love?
Just see your outline...

Back where we left off
Help you take your dress off
I been by myself remembering you
Your body hurts me
Loopin' 'round like CCTV
In all this bitterness you stay so sweet

It's such a cruel world
I'm saving all my love for you girl
In such a cruel world
Maybe I found something good, girl

Sunrise in hollywood
We ain't slept for days
Perfect disaster
Me and you
