You and I have lost our minds
I don’t even know which thoughts are mine
Projected by your fear inside 
But I can see the light
Say when you’re ready to escape
I’ll be your shelter from the rain
I’ll pull you under me and we can make the ground shake
Like an earthquake 

Show us what you got when the motherfucking beat drops

Make the, make the ground shake
Like an earthquake 

You and I are honesty
A sedated type-A intensity
When it’s me against you
And it’s you against me
It’s so hard to breathe
Say when you’re ready to escape
I’ll be your shelter from the rain
I’ll pull you under me and we can make the ground shake
Like an earthquake

Say when you’re ready to escape
I’ll be your shelter from the rain
I’ll pull you under me and we can make the ground shake
Like an earthquake 

Show us what you got when the motherfucking beat drops

Make the, make the ground shake
Like an earthquake
