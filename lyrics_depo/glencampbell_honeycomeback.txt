Well honey I know I've said it many times before I said I'd never say it again
I guess I shouldn't say anything at all since you're supposed to belong to him
But I just can't let you go but I'm tellin' you just how much I love you
So that is why I'm gonna say it one more time
Honey come back I just can't stand each lonely day's a little bit longer
And the last time I held you seems like a hundred years ago
Back to his arms and never know the joy of love that used to taste like
Honey come back where you belong to only me

Well I guess that's about all I gotta say
So I'm just gonna pack my bags and I'm gonna walk
I know those bright lights're callin' you honey big fine cars and fancy clothes
But if you ever want someone to just love you and some day you just may
Just give me a call you know where I am and here's what I'll say
Honey come back...
Honey come back where you belong to only me
Honey come back where you belong to only me
