Like pebbles on a beach
Kicked around, displaced by feet
Like broken stones - they're all trying to get home.
Like a loser's reach
Too slow and short to hit the peaks
Yeah, so lost and alone - they're all trying to get home.

As another piece shatters
Another little bit gets lost
What else truly matters - at such a cost?

Like a loser's reach -
Too slow and short to hit the peaks
Yeah, so lost and alone - (like broken stones) they're all trying to get home.
(Yeah, you are)

And another piece shatters
Another little bit gets lost
Tell me what else really matters - at such a cost?

Like pebbles on a beach
Kicked around, displaced by feet
Oh, like broken stones - they're all trying to get home.
Like a loser's reach
Too slow and short to hit the peaks
Yeah, so lost and alone - they're trying to get home.

Trying to get home, trying to get home,
Like broken stones, they're all trying to get home.
