Remember those walls I built 
Well, baby they're tumbling down 
They didn't even put up a fight 
They didn't even make a sound 

It's like I've been awakened 
Every rule I had you breakin' 
It's the risk that I'm takin' 
I ain't never gonna shut you out 

Everywhere I'm looking now 
I'm surrounded by your embrace 
Baby I can feel your halo 


And don't it feel good! 

I can feel your halo halo halo 
I can see your halo halo halo 
I can feel your halo halo halo (I'm walking on sunshine, wooah) 
I can see your halo halo halo (I'm walking on sunshine, wooah) 

And don't it feel good! 

I used to think maybe you loved me now baby I'm sure 
And I just cant wait till the day when you knock on my door 


Oh now now! 


I'm walking on sunshine, wooah! 
I'm walking on sunshine, wooah! 
I'm walking on sunshine, wooah ohoh! 
And don't it feel good! 

I can feel your halo halo halo 
I can see your halo halo halo 
I can feel your halo halo halo 
I can see your halo halo halo 

I can feel your halo halo halo 
I can see your halo halo halo 


I can see your halo 
HALO!
