Mothers crying in the street
Children dying at their feet, tell me why, ooh tell me why
People starving everywhere
There's too much food but there's none to spare,
Tell me why, oh tell me why

Can you see that shaft of sunlight
can you see it in my eyes
I can feel the fire that's burning
anger and hope so deep
so deep within my heart but before my eyes
for some it's too late
cos it seems there's no-one listening

People sleeping in the streets
no roof above, no food to eat, tell me why, oh tell me why
see the questions in their eyes
listen to their children's cries,
Tell me why, please tell me why

If there's a God, is he watching
can he give a ray of hope
so much pain and so much sorrow
tell me what does he see
when he looks at you
when he looks at me
what would he say
cos it seems there's no-one listening

Who would think it still could happen
even in this time and place
politicians, they may save themselves
ah but they won't save their face
so hope against hope it's not too late

You say there's nothing you can do
is there one rule for them and one for you,
tell me why, just tell my why

Listen can you see that shaft of sunlight
can you see it in my eyes
I can feel the fire that's burning
anger and hope so deep
so deep within my heart but before my eyes
for some it's too late
and it seems there's no-one listening

Hurry for me, hurry for me
Hurry for me, hurry for me, they cry, they cry...
