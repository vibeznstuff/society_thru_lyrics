You're in the corner, turning your back, you're running away again
The more I give you, the less that you take, tell me where is it gonna end?
(Who-oh) I can see you've felt some pain
(Who-oh) I know you've been hurt before
(Who-oh) But I swear you won't get hurt nomore

Tell me how much love is it gonna take
To prove I'm not another heartache
Till you begin to let your heart give in
How much love is it gonna take

I'm reaching for you, getting so close, but you're always a step away
I wanna touch you 'n give you my love, what is it gonna take?
(Who-oh) I can see it in your eyes
(Who-oh) That you wanna let me in
(Who-oh) But you're scared that you'll get hurt again

Tell me how much love is it gonna take
To prove I'm not another heartache
Till you begin to let your heart give in
How much love is it gonna take

I've been searching for an answer 
Uh tell me what it's gonna be?



How much love is it gonna take
To prove I'm not another heartache
Till you begin to let your heart give in
How much love 
How much love is it gonna take
To prove I'm not another heartache
Till you begin to let your heart give in
How much love, tell me how much love
How much love is it gonna take
To prove I'm not another heartache
How much love 
How much love is it gonna take, is it gonna take
How much love 
I can see it in your eyes (How much love)
Come on and let me in, come on and let me in
Yeah, yeah (How much love)
