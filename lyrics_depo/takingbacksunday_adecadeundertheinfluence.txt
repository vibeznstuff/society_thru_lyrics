We used to be this dying breed 
I got a bad feeling about this

You kept still until the long drive home 
You slept safe and close to the window... 
I got a bad feeling about this 
I got a bad feeling about... 

Who's to say you'll have to go (I could go all night) 
Well say you'll have to go (I could go all...) 
To hell with you and all your friends 
To hell with you and all your friends, it's on 

Sad, small, sure in porcelain 
You're skin and bones, I'm a nervous wreck

Anyone will do tonight 
Anyone will do tonight 
Close your eyes, just settle, settle 
Close your eyes, just settle, settle 
Anyone will do tonight

I thought it through and my worst brings out the best in you
