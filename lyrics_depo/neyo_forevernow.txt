Was gonna give you these flowers tonight
Was gonna ask you to stay
Practise all that I would say it just right
But now there are no words to say.
As I watch you kiss him softly the same way you kissed me

I scream, "What am I gonna do with forever now?"
Tell me what am I gonna do with forever now?
All the plans we've made don't work if you're not around
So tell me what am I gonna do with forever now?
What do I do now?

What do I do now?

In slow motion I let these flowers hit the ground
And right before I turn to leave
I watch you kiss him softly then look up and see me

And I scream, "What am I gonna do with forever now?"
Tell me what am I gonna do with forever now?
All the plans we've made don't work if you're not around
So tell me what am I gonna do with forever now?
What do I do now?

Everything you said we would be
All the things you said we'd do
I'll live all my life around the thought of me and you

And I scream, "What am I gonna do with forever now?"
(What do I do, what do I do now?)
Tell me what am I gonna do with forever now?
(What do I do, what do I do now?)
All the plans we've made don't work if you're not around (if you're not around)
So tell me what am I gonna do with forever now?
What do I do now?

What do I do now?
What do I do now?

What do I do, what do I do now?
What do I do now?
What do I do, what do I do now?
