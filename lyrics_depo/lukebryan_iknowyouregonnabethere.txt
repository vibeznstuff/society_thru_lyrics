I'm gonna put on my new shirt
Shine up these old boots
Take a deep breath
Try to keep my cool
I know you're gonna be there
I'm gonna have a couple drinks, just to knock off the edge
Not too much, don't wanna make a fool of myself
I know you're gonna be there, I know you're gonna be there

And I'm gonna bring somebody I barely even know
And when you turn my way, I'm gonna pull her in close
And the crazy thing about it is I ain't into her at all
I just wanna see if you still care
I know you're gonna be there

You love the band that's playing, you wouldn't miss them for the world
All our friends are coming out and if I know one thing, girl, I know you're gonna be there
Gonna walk right by that table were you always like to sit
And when I run into you, it's gonna be an accident
I know you're gonna be there

I'm gonna act like it ain't nothing, but another Friday night
And you're just some old friend and I'm doing just fine
Like I'm only going out to shake off another week
Maybe see the boys and catch a buzz somewhere
But I know you're gonna be there

And I'm gonna bring somebody I barely even know
And when you turn my way, I'm gonna pull her in real close
And the crazy thing about it is I ain't into her at all
I just wanna see if you still care
I know you're gonna be there, I know you're gonna be there

I'm gonna put on my new shirt
Shine up these old boots
Truth is when I see yah, I don't know what I'll do
