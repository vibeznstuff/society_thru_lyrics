Every time we meet,
Everything is sweet
Oh, you're so tender
I must surrender
My love is your love
Now and forever


You're the one that I long to kiss
Baby, you're the one that I really miss
You're the one that I'm dreaming of
Baby, you're the one that I love

Keep me in your heart
Never let us part
Ooh, never leave me
Please don't deceive me
I want you only
You must believe me



I adore you and no one before you
Could make me feel this way
Since I met you, I just can't forget you
I love you more each day

Whoa whoa, yeah yeah

There may be some tears
Through the comin' years
Ooh, all the while
I know you'll be smilin'
Your love will guide me
Through ev'ry mile
'Cause
