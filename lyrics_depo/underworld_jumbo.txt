I need sugar 
I need a little watersugar 
I get thoughts about you
And the night it wants me like a little lost child
Locked in a safe place
Lookin out the window
The dark move fast past the window
The dark on the other side of the locked door

Only these wires
Dust between the wires 
And the green grass

In the distance
I am your tourist
