My nights are broken up by the sounds of women I’ll never meet
And when my eyes are closed I can start to feel you staring at me
The right side of my bed has always left me feeling stuck in between (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Everything I know and all the lies I tell myself so I can sleep

Pick apart the pieces you left
Don’t you worry about it, don’t you worry about it
Try and give yourself some rest
And let me worry about it, let me worry about it

You came around to say that you’ve been away, like I hadn’t known
As if I don’t wake up every single day not seeing you go
As if this moon of ours only shines a half to make me feel whole
As if I haven’t felt your breath in every step I take when the wind blows

Pick apart the pieces you left
Don’t you worry about it, don’t you worry about it
Try and give yourself some rest
And let me worry about it, let me worry about it


(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (worry)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (worry)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (worry)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (worry)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (worry)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (worry)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (worry)

Pick apart the pieces you left
Don’t you worry about it, don’t you worry about it
Try and give yourself some rest
And let me worry about it, let me worry about it
(Worry) (Worry)
(Worry) (Don’t you worry)
