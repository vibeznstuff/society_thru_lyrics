when i first held i was cold
a melting snowman i was told
but there was no one there to hold 
before i swore that i would be alone for ever more
wow look at you now
flowers in the window
it's such a lovely day
and i'm glad you feel the same
cos to stand up
out in the crowd
you are one in a million
and i love you so let's watch the flowers grow
there is no reason to feel bad
but there are many seasons to feel sad glad mad
it's just a bunch of feelings that we have to hold
but i am here to help you with the load
wow look at you now
flowers in the window
it's such a lovely day and i'm glad you feel the same
cos to stand up
out in the crowd
you are one in a million
and i love you so let's watch the flowers grow
so now we're here and now is fine
so far away from there and there is time time time
to plant new seeds and watch them grow 
so there'll be flowers in the window when we go
wow look at us now
flowers in the window
it's such a lovely day and i'm glad you feel the same
cos to stand up
out out in the crowd you are one in a million and i love you 
so let's watch the flowers grow
oh wow look at you now flowers in the window
it's such a lovely day
and i'm glad you feel the same cos to stand up
out in the crowd
you are one in a million
and i love you so let's watch the flowers grow
let's watch the flowers grow
