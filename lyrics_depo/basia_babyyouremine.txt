Sitting there and feeling lonely
Had my blue eyes for you only
Suddenly you turned around and smiled at me

It wasn't my imagination
Had no doubts no hesitation
When it comes to love I know where I wanna be

Is it real am I dreaming
I've been waiting light years for someone like you
Can't believe you are here with me
I've got you and I can't hide it anymore
I want the world to know that

Baby you're mine
You are blowing my mind
We are two of a kind
Baby you're really mine

Now I see what I've been missing
It's the happiest girl you're kissing
Baby only you can make me feel like this
