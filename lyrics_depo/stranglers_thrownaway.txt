If ever you had counted
The centuries you threw away
And all the lies that you had started
And all the chances thrown away

If I set sail for new horizons
Could I still leave you waiting here
I would chase just one set of chances
The others would be thrown away

Even though we tried time wasn't on our side
Then there came the day we threw it all away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away

My winter nights are so much colder
Than yours could ever be
I wish I hadn't been a traveller
I would not have had to go away

When all is said and all is over
When all is just a memory
Our ships will stay for just a moment
Leaving false Gods and hypocrisy

Even though we tried time wasn't on our side
Then there came the day we threw it all away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away

Even though we tried time wasn't on our side
Then there came the day we threw it all away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
