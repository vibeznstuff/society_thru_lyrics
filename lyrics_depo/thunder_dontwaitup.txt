Tell me why you have to be watching me nearly all the time
'Cause even when I look in the mirror now, I see you standing behind
That's right, that's right had enough of accusations and fights
Got me wound up tight so don't wait up for me on Saturday night, yeah

I don't know why you're feeling the way you are, but something made you change
I tried to re-assure you so many times, but now I'm tired of the game

That's right, that's right keep telling me I have, then I might
You can say what you like just don't wait up for me on Saturday night

You keep on saying you've lost your faith in me
Keep on telling me where I'm s'posed to be
But now I've got to the point where I just don't care

Every time I pick up the telephone, I hear you there on the party line
You ask me if I'm sleeping with all your friends, but they ain't no friends of mine
That's right, that's right had enough of accusations and fights
Got me wound up tight so don't wait up for me on Saturday night, listen honey

You keep on saying you've lost your faith in me
Keep on telling me where I'm s'posed to be
But now I've got to the point where I just don't care
Yeah yeah

Don't wait up, 'cause I won't be home baby
Don't wait up, 'cause I won't be home
Don't wait up Saturday night, mmm
I won't be home,
I won't be home,
