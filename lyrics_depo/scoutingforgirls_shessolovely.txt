I love the way she fills her clothes.
She looks just like them girls in vogue.
I love the way she plays it cool.
I think that she is beautiful.

She's so lovely
She's so lovely
She's so lovely
She's so lovely


She's pretty, a fitty
She's got a boyfriend though and that's a pity.
She's flirty turned thirty
Ain't that the age a girl gets really dirty?

I don't know

How we'll make it through this.

I love the way she bites her lip
I love the way she shakes them hips.
I love the way she makes me drool.
I think that she is beautiful.

She's so lovely
She's so lovely
She's so lovely
She's so lovely


A stunner, I want her
Was she this fit when she was 10 years younger?
Come see me discreetly.
She says she's got a trick or two to teach me.

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
How we'll make it through this. 
I don't know

I think that you are lovely

I think that you are beautiful.
