I walk a mile with a smile I don’t know I don’t care where I am
But I know it’s alright
Jump the tracks can’t get back I don’t know anyone around here
But I’m safe this time

Cos when you, tell me, tell me, tell me stupid things, like you do
Yes I, have to, have to, have to change the rules, I can’t lose

Cos I shiver, I just break up, when I’m near you it all gets out of hand
Yes I shiver, I get bent up, there’s no way that I’ll know you’ll understand

We talk and talk around it all, who’d of thought we’d end up here
But I’m feeling fine
In a rush never trust you’ll be there, if I’d only stop
And take my time

Cos with you, I’m running, running, running somewhere I can’t get to
Yes I, have to, have to, have to change the rules, I’m with you

Cos I shiver, I just break up when I’m near you it all gets out of hand
Yes I shiver I get bent up there’s no way that I’ll know you’ll understand

What if you get of at the next stop?
Would you just wait as I’m drifting off?
And if I never saw you again, could I, put all, of this, aside

Cos I shiver, I just break up when I’m near you it all gets out of hand
Yes I shiver I get bent up there’s no way that I’ll know you’ll understand

I shiver, I shiver, 
Cos I shiver, I just break up when I’m near you it all gets out of hand
Yes I shiver I get bent up there’s no way that I know you’ll understand
