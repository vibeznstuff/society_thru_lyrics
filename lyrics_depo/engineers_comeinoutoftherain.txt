I'm not to blame, no cracks in my shell so far,
There is no shame, you're in the clear so far,
'cause you've said it, doesn't make it so,
Doesn't mean that time stands still between us,
There's nothing left to know,
What you've stolen isn't really yours,
Though your words they have no meaning,
Your awkwardness still shows.

Ease it down,
Come in out of the rain,
To a better place,
Sleaze is all you know,
That with causing you pain,
It's all you'll ever know.

I'm not to blame, no cracks in my shell so far,
There is no shame, you're in the clear so far,
Every thought you think's not how it goes,
Though to see the way you treat them, explains your empty soul,
Make demands of others that you control,
There will always be that certain someone, whose answer will be no.
