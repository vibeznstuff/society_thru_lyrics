If you got an answer
Girl, I could really use it
Chip on my shoulder
You know I could stand, to lose it

Don't let us waste no time, no!
A good thing is hard to find, oh!
And you know exactly
What's on my mind

Ooh la la! You're such a turn-me-on lady
Ooh la la! You're such a beautiful you
My my my my! You're such a funky young lady
Ooh la la! You're such a beautiful you

Nobody warned me
That someone so young, so sweetly
Can do how you do me
More than I could be done so deeply

You got what you got and you know it
I can tell by the way you show it
This is or chance
Come on! Let's not blow it

Ooh la la! You're such a turn-me-on lady
Ooh la la! You're such a beautiful you
My my my my! You're such a funky young lady
Ooh la la! You're such a beautiful you

You got what you got and you know it
I can tell by the way you show it, Ooh!
This is our chance
Honey! Let's not blow it

Ooh la la! You're such a turn-me-on lady
Ooh la la! You're such a beautiful you
Ooh la la! You're such a, such a, such a beautiful you
Yeah! You're such a, such a beautiful you
That's a funky young lady...
