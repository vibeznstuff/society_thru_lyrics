And then she's here and then she's gone,
Never to be seen again,
And then she's here and then she's gone,
Never to be seen again.

I'm trying not to think of her 
But think of nothing else,
And the sight of her shoes 
At the end of the bed,
And the gap on the wall 
Where she hangs up her jacket
I try not to think of her
But you see I'm on a losing streak,
And the bathroom's is bare, 
And the kitchen's cold,
And the nights are long,
Now try and remember...

How good it was, even if it's over
Please remember,
They way that we were in our own little world
Back when we were young,
How good it was, even if it's over
Please recall
The time that we said that we'd never regret
Back when we were young

And then she's here and then she's gone
Never to be seen again,
And then she's here and then she's gone
Never to be seen again.

I try not to think of you 
But think of nothing else,
And here's to you out and enjoying 
Yourself well I hope that 
You are but not that much,
Are you checking your phone 
To see if I care?
Are you secretly wishing
I want you there?
Do you still think of me favourably?
I hope that you do,
Please say you remember...

How good it was, even if it's over
Please remember,
They way that we were in our own little world
Back when we were young,
How good it was, even if it's over
Please recall
The time that we said that we'd never regret
Back when we were young

How good it was, even if it's over
Please remember,
They way that we were in our own little world
Back when we were young,
How good it was, even if it's over
Please recall
The time that we said that we'd never regret
Back when we were young
