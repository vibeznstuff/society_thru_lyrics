OOOOIII!!
ha ha ha ha ahaha ahahaha
yea!

STUPID!


Fix up look sharp
don't make me paint a bitch
something get dark
hear the bang, see the spark
duck down, lay down just (get on down)

I got the big beat
I hear the sound
I got the big beat (Dizzee Rascal!)
I get on down


I've heard the gossip from the street to the slammer,
They're trying to see if Dizzee stays true to his grammer,
Being a celebrity don't mean shit to me,
Fuck the glitz and glamour, hey I'm with the Blicks and Gamma
Because they're talking 'bout rushing
Talk behind my back but to my face they say nothin',
Stand up in the Parks, keep a firm, steady stance,
Keep the beanies touching, keep the beanies hot flushin,
Flushin MC's down the loo,
If you don't believe me bring your posse, bring your crew,
Feel free to hate cos i ain't trying-a be your mate,
Be serious you wouldn't last an hour in my shoes
It's an Air-Force-One,
Trainers by the truck load, trainers by the tonne,
Don't feel dazed when I catch you by your jays,
Chump, best to act like Forrest Gump, best to run!



I stay sweet as a nut, sweet like Tropicana,
When the hammer hits, your head splits like banana
Your not ready for this girl,
You better send your best soldiers, 'cos this is Captain Rascal!
More destructive and troublesome than ever,
I'll probably be doing this, probably forever,
Fellas wanna stop me don't probably come together,
Its probable they'll stop me, probably never,
You Topman, Topman, hard toppa toppa,
Come to me with an attitude, come a cropper,
I'm old school like Happy Shopper,
I fight old school, bring your bat and your chopper,
And a First Aid Kit, and some antiseptic, this could get hectic,
I'm a done accept it, you got a bright future,
Don't let my shit affect it!



Fix up!
