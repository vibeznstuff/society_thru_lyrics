Only one shadow on the wall
Just one candle burning bright
I hold your picture to my heart
I'm alone inside the night
The sun comes up in China... the lights go on in Rome

Half the world is waiting for someone they can hold
Half the world is praying they'll never be alone
Everytime you leave me a part of me goes too
And half your world is waiting here for you

I reach across an empty bed
I hear your whisper in my ear
But like the sun without the moon
It's half a dream without you here
The train that takes you from me
Brings somebody home

Half the world is waiting for someone they can hold
Half the world is praying they'll never be alone
Everytime you leave me a part of me goes too
And half your world is waiting here for you

Baby the earth stands still
When I'm lying next to you
No matter where you go
Our whole world's inside this room
The sun comes up in China
The lights go on in Rome... oh

Half the world is waiting for someone they can hold
Half the world is praying they'll never be alone
And everytime you leave me my heart breaks in two
And half the world is waiting here for you

I'm waiting here for you...
