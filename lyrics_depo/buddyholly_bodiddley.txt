Bo Diddley'll buy baby a diamond ring
If that diamond ring don't shine
He's gonna take it to a private eye
If that private eye can't see
He better not take-a ring-a from me

Won't you come to my house a-back at home
Take-a my baby on the way from home
Love-a that boo-doo, oh where've you been
Up to your house and gone again

Bo Diddley caught a bearcat
To make a pretty baby a Sunday hat
Bo Diddley caught a nanny-goat
To make a pretty baby a Sunday coat

Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley have you heard
My pretty baby said she was a bird
