Love you in real life

It means nothing
If you don't know what you got
You make it feel like Sunday
And it keeps me holding up
And up

These flashing lights
The temporary it's not the end
The morning sun
Who lets an enter make, pretend

I only wanna love you, in real life
Love you in real life
I only wanna love you, in real life
Love you in real life

Love you in real life
Love you in real life

Don't lose your touch
I got farity
You and me babe
That's how it's gonna be

These flashing lights
The temporary it's not the end
The morning sun
Who lets an enter make, pretend

I only wanna love you, in real life
Love you in real life
I only wanna love you, in real life
Love you in real life

Love you in real life
Love you in real life

I just wanna love you
I just wanna love you in real life
I just wanna love you
I just wanna love you in real life

I only wanna love you, in real life
Love you in real life
I only wanna love you, in real life
Love you in real life

I only wanna love you, in real life
Love you in real life
I only wanna love you, in real life
Love you in real life

Love you in real life
Love you in real life
I really wanna love you
I really wanna love you
