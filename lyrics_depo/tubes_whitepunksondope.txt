Teenage had a race for the night time
Spent my cash on every high I could find
Wasted time in every school in L.A.
Getting loose, I didn't care what the kids say

We're white punks on dope
Mom &amp; Dad moved to Hollywood
Hang myself when I get enough rope
Can't clean up, though I know I should
White punks on dope
(White punks on dope)
White punks on dope
(White punks on dope)

Other dudes are living in the ghetto
(Wa-oo-wa-oo-wa-oo-wa-ooooo)
But born in Pacific Heights don't seem much betto
(Wa-oo-wa-oo-wa-oo-wa-ooooo)

We're white punks on dope
Mom &amp; Dad live in Hollywood
Hang myself when I get enough rope
I can't clean up, though I know I should
White punks on dope
(White punks on dope)
White punks on dope
(White punks on dope)

I go crazy 'cause my folks are so fucking rich
(Wa-oo-wa-oo-wa-oo-wa-ooooo)
Have to score when I get that rich white punk itch
Sounds real classy, living in a chateau
(Wa-oo-wa-oo-wa-oo-wa-ooooo)
So lonely, all the other kids will never know

We're white punks on dope
Mom &amp; Dad live in Hollywood
Hang myself when I get enough rope
Can't clean up, though I know I should
White punks on dope
White punks on dope
White punks on dope
White punks on dope

White punks on dope
White punks on dope
White punks on dope
White punks on dope

White punks on dope

White punks on dope...
