Every Night She Walks Right In My Dreams
Since I Met Her From The Start
I'm So Proud I Am The Only One
Who Is Special In Her Heart


The Girl Is Mine
The Doggone Girl Is Mine
I Know She's Mine
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine


I Don't Understand The Way You Think
Saying That She's Yours Not Mine
Sending Roses And Your Silly Dreams
Really Just A Waste Of Time


Because She's Mine
The Doggone Girl Is Mine
Don't Waste Your Time
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine


I Love You More Than He
(Take You Anywhere)


But I Love You Endlessly
(Loving We Will Share)


So Come And Go With Me
To One Town


But We Both Cannot Have Her
So It's One Or The Other
And One Day You'll Discover
That She's My Girl Forever And Ever


I Don't Build Your Hopes To Be Let Down
'Cause I Really Feel It's Time


I Know She'll Tell You I'm The One For Her
'Cause She Said I Blow Her Mind
Chorus (Michael)
The Girl Is Mine
The Doggone Girl Is Mine
Don't Waste Your Time
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine


She's Mine, She's Mine
No, No, No, She's Mine
The Girl Is Mine, The Girl Is Mine
The Girl Is Mine, The Girl Is Mine


The Girl Is Mine, (Yep) She's Mine
The Girl Is Mine, (Yep) She's Mine


Don't Waste Your Time
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine
The Girl Is Mine, The Girl Is Mine


Michael, We're Not Going To Fight About This, Okay


Paul, I Think I Told You, I'm A Lover Not A Fighter


I've Heard It All Before, Michael
She Told Me That I'm Her Forever Lover, You Know, Don't You Remember


Well, After Loving Me, She Said She Couldn't Love Another


Is That What She Said


Yes, She Said It, You Keep Dreaming


I Don't Believe It


The Girl Is Mine (Mine, Mine, Mine)
