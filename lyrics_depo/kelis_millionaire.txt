She said him from the country so him got to be funky, funky


Mama i'ma Millionaire but I feel like a bum.
Mama i'ma Millionaire but I feel like the only one.

I don't think think ya'll heard me,
I woke up early this mornin, but i still ain't seen the sun.

Papa i'ma Milionaire,
Sax 5th Ave. don't sell affection.
(Sax 5th Ave. don't sell affection).
Papa i'ma Millionaire but i ain't movin in the right direction,
Somethin ain't right, I know.

I am rich, to he is rich, she is rich, to we is rich


Where there is cheese there are rats,
Where ever there are rats there are cats,
Where ever there are cats there are dogs.
If you got the dogs you got bitches.
Bitches Always out to put their paws on your riches.
If you got riches,you got glitches.
If you got glitches in your life computer turn it off and then reboota.
Now you back on.
Can't just put the cap on the old bottle once you pop it that will spoil it, gone and drink it and enjoy it.
Mama i'ma Millionaire.

What's a girl to do in a world of greed but kneel and pray-yay-yay-yay.
What's a girl to do when she's lost her long time friends that's lie-ie-ie-ie-ied
