 Sundown
Friday twilight in the big town
Party people getting ready now
Somewhere baby,
I know your waiting, the city's vibrating

 The city's in a heatwave
Praying for the sun shade
Hoping that the evening will chill down the streets
Frankie: And I'm a little hot too
Cause I can only think of you
Hoping that tonight you'll find out what I like

 Sundown
Friday twilight in the big town
Party people getting ready now
Somewhere baby,
I know your waiting, the city's vibrating
Sundown
Air gets cooler but my heart pounds
Loud and fast, I'm getting ready now
Somewhere baby,
I know your waiting, the city's vibrating

 I don't know if you see me
Don't know if you are dreaming
Hoping for someone who can show you who you are
Frankie: Tonight I'm going to find you
Flying on a breeze and blind you
Take you from this club land and send us to the stars

 Sundown
Friday twilight in the big town
Party people getting ready now
Somewhere baby,
I know your waiting, the city's vibrating
Sundown
Air gets cooler but my heart pounds
Loud and fast, I'm getting ready now
Somewhere baby,
I know your waiting, the city's vibrating

 Bring back, back and forth   

 Time don't need to rush, we can make it right 
Cause we are meant to be, you and I 
Itâ€™s in the air we breathe all around, all around
 Say you're longing too, cause I will look for you at
