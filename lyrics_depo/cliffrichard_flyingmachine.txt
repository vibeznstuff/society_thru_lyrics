When the weather is fine,
And the clouds have gone by,
I go up in the air,
Waving people goodbye,
In my flying machine,
I go up, I go down, I go round and round

I can race with the birds,
I can fight with the wind,
I can fly on my head,
I can dance in a spin,
In my flying machine,
I go up, I go down, I go round and round and round,

People on the ground,
They gathered all around to admire,
There's a feeling inside me
That gives me the urge to go higher,

Well, I know what goes up,
Will eventually fall,
So I won't take no chances,
While I'm having a ball,
In my flying machine,
I go up, I go down, I go round and round and round and round

Higher and higher!

People on the ground,
They gathered all around to admire,
There's a feeling inside me
That gives me the urge to go higher,aaahhh

But I know what goes up,
Will eventually fall
So I won't take no chances,
While I'm having a ball,
In my flying machine,
I go up, I go down, I go round and round and round and round, yeah,

Higher and higher!
Higher and higher!
Higher and higher!
