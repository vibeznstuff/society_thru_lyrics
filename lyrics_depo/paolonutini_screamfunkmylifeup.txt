How was I to know you’d just come along?
(And funk my life up)
Lips like they’ve been singing sexed up strawberry songs
(Just funk my life up)
Never heard it coming, thought it’s just another woman
With a shotgun in her hand
(Funk my life up)

She’s the bass, she’s the beat, she’s the rhythm, she’s the band
(Just funk my life up)
And the girl, so fine
Makes you wanna scream Hallelujah

Sly hands, spinning webs like silk
Beats are dripping on me, like spider milk
And I never heard the warning when I woke up this morning
With my sunshine on a drip

She’s my rock, she’s my bud, she’s tequila, she’s a trip
And that girl, so fine
Makes you wanna scream Hallelujah

How can I refuse? I’m not fit to chose
(Just funk my life up)
I said the only way I win is the way I lose
(Just funk my life up)
And I never got the script, I unzipped
Got a little bit wet up in my brain
She’s your church, she’s your sin, she’s atomic,
she’s the oh she’s the rain
And the girl, so fine you wanna scream 
Yeah, yeah

She gets me silly, she’s like a trick on me
Hell, I don’t even know her name but yet she sticks to me
And in the climax she would scream with me
Yeah, she sticks to me
She gets me funny, she doesn’t want none of my money
So I pour it over her like gasoline
Light a match and then I’m back in my teens
Me and super girl smoking my green
Me and super girl smoking my green

Unload, reload, eyes back swinging,
Sweet thing, knows things, Jeff Beck sings
Roundhouse, going down…… Let’s go!
And the girl so fine makes you wanna scream Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Yeah, the girl, so fine, you wanna scream
