My heart feels like the sharpest razor blade
I really hope this won't give me away
Cause I've been drowning here for days
Like a watercolor about to fade
Every inch of me is there to trace
No secrets left here on my page
Underneath my skin, I see a change
Blood races right up to my face

Bursting out, no, I can't take it
You really wore me down
Read my mind just like I'm naked
There's no hiding now
I'm paper thin, paper thin
Paper thin, paper thin

You make me feel like a piece of art
Hanging on your wall, just like my heart
Making shadows even in the dark
I'm see-through but I won't fall apart

Bursting out, no, I can't take it
You really wore me down
Read my mind just like I'm naked
There's no hiding now
I'm paper thin, paper thin
Paper thin, paper thin
Paper thin, paper thin
Paper thin

Slowly you've been wearing me down
Pulling up my roots from the ground
The way I feel's so obvious now
Cause I'm paper thin in love with you now

I'm bursting out, no, I can't take it
You really wore me down
Read my mind just like I'm naked
There's no hiding now
I'm paper thin, paper thin
Paper thin, paper thin
Paper thin, paper thin
Paper thin
