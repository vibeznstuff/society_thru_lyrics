I don't even know if I could cry
Been so long, it seems like I've run dry
Something in your eyes tonight
Looked into my soul
Saw the years of breaking down
Have taken its toll
So I'm leaning on you now into the night..

Don't let go.. don't let go.. don't let go..
I don't wanna let you go

Now I'm on the rocks, I see your lie
I don't need my wings to take this flight
I know I can fly
Nothing happens on its own, fate is just a word
You make me a better man..
Does that sound absurd?
And you look into my eyes and softly say..

Don't let go.. don't let go.. don't let go..
I don't wanna let you go

You are the light in me, pull me in and set me free
You always let me know
Hold on tight and don't let go..

Don't let go.. don't let go.. don't let go..
I don't wanna let you go

Don't let go.. don't let go.. don't let go..
Don't let go.. don't let go.. don't let go..
