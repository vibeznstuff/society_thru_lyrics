The way she walks
The way she talks
How long I can I pretend
Oh I can't help it I'm in love
With the girl of my best friend

Her lovely hair her skin so fair
I could go on 'n' never end
No I can't help it I'm love
With the girl of my best friend

I want to tell her how I love her so
And hold her in my arms, but then
What if she got real mad and told him so
I could never face either once again

The way they kiss their happiness
Will my aching heart ever mend
Or will I always be in love
With the girl of my best friend

Never end
Never end
Never end
