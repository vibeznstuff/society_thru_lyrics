Take a little bit of this girl,
I will show you what I’m on,
It’s not the beginning of something unwritten,
It feels like we’re living too fast to fall asleep,

Take a little hit of this girl,
I will show you the way tonight,
And I promise,
That this could be everything you needed,
This could be everything you dreamed of,
And I, won’t waste a minute of time that we’re living,
I won’t waste a day less I’m wasting my days with you,
I won’t waste a day less I’m wasting my days with you,
I won’t waste away less I’m wasting away with you,
Yeah oh, yeah oh,

Let it in, let it be babe,
This is everything you need baby,
We have all this time to waste,
I won’t even make you wait,
So just come and lay with me,
And I will show you how,
I can show you now,
Take a hit and let it out,
Cause there’s a method to my madness,
All you needs a little practice,
Follow me baby, you don’t have to say a thing,
Keep your eyes closed we can live in reverie,
Breathe just a little deeper,
There is no better feeling than now,
And I promise,

And I promise,
That this could be everything you needed,
This could be everything you dreamed of,
And I, won’t waste a minute of time that we’re living,
I won’t waste a day less I’m wasting my days with you,
I won’t waste a day less I’m wasting my days with you,
I won’t waste away less I’m wasting away with you
