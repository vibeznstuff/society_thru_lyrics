If love was a word, I don't understand.
Simplest sound, four letters.
Whatever it was, I'm over it now.
With every day, it gets better (it gets better)

Are you loving the pain, loving the pain?
And with everyday, everyday
I try to move on.
Whatever it was,
Whatever it was,
There's nothing now.
You changed.
New Age.

I'm walking away, From everything I had.
I need a room with new colours.
There was a time,
When I didn't mind living the life of others.

Are you loving the pain, loving the pain?
And with everyday, everyday
I try to move on.
Whatever it was,
Whatever it was,
There's nothing now.
You changed.
New Age.

So much fire that it burned my wings.
Her heat was amazing.
Now I'm dreaming of the simple things.
Old ways, erased.
If love was a word,
I don't understand.
The simplest sound,
Four letters.

Are you loving the pain, loving the pain?
And with everyday, everyday
I try to move on.
Whatever it was,
Whatever it was,
There's nothing now.
You changed.
New Age.

Loving the pain, loving the pain?
And with everyday, everyday
I try to move on.
Whatever it was,
Whatever it was,
There's nothing now.
You changed.
New Age.
