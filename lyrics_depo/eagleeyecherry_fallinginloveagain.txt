I'm so tired
Of falling in love
Finding it easier to fall out
Can't deny it
I feel it inside Cupid's fire
I can't hide


I'm falling in love again
Ain't nothing I can do
Falling in love again
Girl this time it's with you
When I fall
It's always the same
And I'm so tired
Of playing this game

It's been so long now
Since I gave up my heart
I've kept it locked down
I don't wanna get it harmed
So let me tell you now
I just want to be sure
That you won't hurt me
Can you promise me that



You got to tell me
If you're going to break my heart
'Cos I don't wanna take the chance
And if it ain't true
All it's gonna be
Is nothing but a poor romance
So give me that promise to hold on
And I'll never let you go
We gotta have something to go on
I'm letting you know now



Falling in love again
