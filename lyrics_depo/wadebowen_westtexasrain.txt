I have been restless
I have been reckless
I’ve been a strain on my mom’s heart

I’ve been a drunk
I’ve been a dreamer
Pulling the strings on this old guitar

I’ve found a few answers
I’ve still got questions
Kept it together and fallen apart

I got secrets and stories
Old shoebox memories
And choices that I’d like to change

Teardrops and laughter
And me chasing after
Years that go as quick as they came

Like a west Texas rain
Like a west Texas rain

Well I’ve been a lover
I’ve been a father
I’ve been a brother
And I’ve been a son

Well I’ve been a preacher
I’ve been a sinner
If you can name it,
I’ve probably been one

I’m strong for the struggle
Constantly reaching,
Reaching for something that I’ve never down

And I got secrets and stories
Old shoebox memories
Choices that I’d like to change

I got teardrops and laughter
And me chasing after
Years that go as quick as they came

Like a west Texas rain
Like a west Texas rain

So close your eyes and hold on
We’re here and we’re gone
It goes as quick as it came
Just like a west Texas rain
Just like a west Texas rain
Just like a west Texas rain
Just like a west Texas rain
