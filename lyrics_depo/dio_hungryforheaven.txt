You're a dancer but you're dancing on air just a matter of time till you fall
You're a dreamer one night at the fair but still you want it all
You're in danger the last of a line but the vision lasts forever
So just hold on you can make it happen for you reach for the stars and you will fly
You 're hungry for heaven hungry for heaven hungry for heaven 
But you need a little hell oh oh oh ooh oh
You're a runner but you're chasing yourself feel the hot breath on your shoulder
You're emotion running cold running warm the young just getting older
We are sunlight we can sparkle and shine and our dreams are what we're made of
Oh just hold on you can make it happen for you reach for the stars and you will fly
You 're hungry for heaven hungry for heaven hungry for heaven 
But you need a little hell oh oh oh ooh oh hungry
You 're hungry for heaven hungry for heaven hungry for heaven hungry for heaven
You're hungry for heaven oh hungry for heaven so hungry for heaven you're hungry for heaven
You're a dancer but you're dancing on air you're a dreamer one night at the fair
You're hungry hungry there for heaven oh oh oh
You're a runner in the night just a dreamer but that's alright
You're hungry hungry for heaven oh hungry hungry for heaven
Hungry for heaven hungry for heaven no no no
