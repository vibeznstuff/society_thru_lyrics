They said she had a heart attack
I think the creatures coming back
And I am fine, coz all my love's electrifying
And I come feel like assessable
Wanna be with you
And it's my premonition
I better give my heart a listen
And my preacher say

All of your demons will wither away
Ecstasy comes and they cannot stay
You'll understand when you come my way
Coz all of my demons have withered away

All of your demons will wither away
Ecstasy comes and they cannot stay
You'll understand when you come my way
Coz all of my demons have withered away
All of my demons have withered away

He said he shook himself to death
I wanna dance to my last breath
?? only party's hard and ??
Come feel like assessable
Wanna be with you, wanna be with you
And it's my premonition
I better give my heart a listen
And my preacher say

All of your demons will wither away
Ecstasy comes and they cannot stay
You'll understand when you come my way
Coz all of my demons have withered away

All of your demons will wither away
Ecstasy comes and they cannot stay
You'll understand when you come my way
Coz all of my demons have withered away

All of your demons wither away
