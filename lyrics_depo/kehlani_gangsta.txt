I need a gangsta
To love me better
Than all the others do
To always forgive me
Ride or die with me
That's just what gangsters do

I'm fucked up, I'm black and blue
I'm built for all the abuse
I got secrets that nobody, nobody, nobody knows
I'm good on that pussy shit
I don't want what I can get
I want someone with secrets that nobody, nobody, nobody knows

I need a gangsta
To love me better
Than all the others do
To always forgive me
Ride or die with me
That's just what gangsters do

My freakness is on the loose
And running all over you
Please, take me to places that nobody, nobody knows
You got me hooked up on the feeling
You got me hanging from the ceiling
Got me up so high I'm barely breathing
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me, don't let me go

I need a gangsta (gangsta gangsta)
To love me better (love me, love me better better, baby)
Than all the others do (they do, they do, they do, oh, oh, oh)
To always forgive me (always forgive me)
Ride or die with me (ride or die with me)
That's just what gangsters do (do, oh)
