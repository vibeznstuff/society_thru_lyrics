Baby, you're cool
And even though you've never been to school
I know you're fine
but then you change your mind
Then you start on driftin'
and fall on behind

You've been my girl
You've been mine
all of the time

A bad night
its gonna be
A bad night
I guarantee
tonight I'll have
A bad night
I know I shall

ah, 'cause you left me waiting in the corner
and i know you're never gonna come back for me
and though you said you loved me
and said you needed all of my love
a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad night
its gonna be

A bad night
it's gonna be
A bad night
I guarantee
tonight I'll have
A bad night
I know I shall

Maybe if the weather was just a little better
it might not have happened that way
but the situation was gettin' pretty bad, bad
A bad bad bad bad bad night it's gonna be

A bad night
it's gonna be
A bad night
I guarantee
tonight I'll have
A bad night
I know I shall
I know I shall
