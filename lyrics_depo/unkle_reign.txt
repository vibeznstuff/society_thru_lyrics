I am the lightning
I am the heat
I am the rain
Rain (reign) all day
I am the rain
I'm gonna reign this way again
I am the rain

I am the spy
Before the blade
I am the raindrop out at sea
I cause the ripples that become the crashing waves
I am the rain
Rain (reign) all day
I am the rain

You thought a different day had come
A day you thought the earth was done
And if you could have said it all
I know you would have said it all

I am the rain
I'm gonna reign this way again
I am the rain
Rain (reign) all day

You thought a different day had come
A day you thought the earth was done
I am the rain
And if you could have said it all
I know you would have said it all
I am the rain
