Usurping Cowards
Dividing the nation
False use of power
Total damnation

Unending fight
They use Force to prove their right
I cannot hide
(I know that we must defy!)

Why can't we see it
They're trying to make a slave of you
Take back your freedom
(Take it back, take it back!)

I have such pride
In the land I thought was mine
I can't deny
(And I fear my home has died!)

Why can't we see it
They're trying to make a slave of you
Take back your freedom
(Take it back, take it back!)

Why can't we see it (Why can't we see it?)
No one believes deep down is true
Take back your freedom
(Take it back, take it back!)

Enslaving and Binding While Countrymen sleeping
Traitorous Minions of Dominance Reaching
Cast out the Fallen and All Who would Keep Them
Take it back

Why can't we see it (Why can't we see it?)
They're trying to make a slave of you
Take back your freedom
(Take it back, take it back!)

Why can't we see it (Why can't we see it?)
No one believes deep down is true
Take back your freedom
(Take it back, take it back!)

Bowed with Lies
Terrified

Why can't we see it,
They're trying to make a slave of you
Take back your freedom
Take it back, take it back
