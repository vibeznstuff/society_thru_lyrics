If I only knew your name
I'd go from door to door
Searching all the crowded streets
For the face that I once saw

If I only knew your name
I'd go from door to door
Tell me have you seen the girl
I've met just once before

One Night of Love
Nothing more nothing less
One Night of Love
To put my head in a mess
Is that you on the bus?
Is that you on the train?
You wrote your number on my hand
And it came off in the rain

One Night of Love
Nothing more nothing less
One Night of Love
It left my bed in a mess
Is that you on the bus?
Is that you on the train?
You wrote your number on my hand
And it came off in the rain

If I only knew your name
I'd go from door to door
Searching all the crowded streets
For the face that I once saw

If I only knew your name
I'd go from door to door
Tell me have you seen the girl
I've met just once before


Young Love
Never seems to last
Far too young
Until they have a past
Playing games
People move so fast
You don't need eyes to see
If someone's got a heart of glass

Young Love
Never seems to last
Far too young
Until they have a past
One night of love
Nothing more nothing less
One night of love
It left my heart in a mess

If I only knew your name
I'd go from door to door
Searching all the crowded streets
For the face that I once saw

If I only knew your name
I'd go from door to door
Tell me have you seen the boy
I've met just once before
