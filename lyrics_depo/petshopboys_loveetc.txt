(You need more, you need more
You need more, you need more
You need more, you need more
You need more, you need more
You need more)

Boy, it's tough getting on in the world
When the sun doesn't shine
And a boy needs a girl
It's about getting out of a rut
You need luck
But you're stuck
And you don't know how

Oh
(don't have to be) a big bucks Hollywood star
(don't have to drive) a super car to get far
(don't have to live) a life of power and wealth
(don't have to be) beautiful, but it helps

(don't have to buy) a house in Beverly Hills
(don't have to have) your daddy paying the bills
(don't have to live) a life of power and wealth
(don't have to be) beautiful, but it helps

(you need more)
Than a big blank check to be your lover or
A gulf stream jet to fly you door to door
Somewhere chic on another shore
You need more, you need more
You need more, you need more
You need more, you need more
You need love
You need love
You need love

Too much
Of anything
Is never enough
Too much
Of everything
Is never enough

Boy, it's tough getting on in the world
When the sun doesn't shine
And a boy needs a girl
It's about getting out of a rut
You need luck
But you're stuck
And you don't know how

Oh
(don't have to be) a big bucks Hollywood star
(don't have to drive) a super car to get far
(don't have to wear) a smile much colder than ice
(don't have to be) beautiful, but it's nice

(you need more) than the Gerhard Richter hanging on your wall
A chauffeur-driven limousine on call
To drive your wife and lover to a white tie ball
You need more, you need more
You need more, you need more
You need more, you need more
You need love

"You need more" 
I believe
That we can achieve
The love that we need
I believe
Probably naive
That love is for free

Oh
(don't have to be) a big bucks Hollywood star
(don't have to drive) a super car to get far
(don't have to live) a life of power and wealth
(don't have to be) beautiful, but it helps
Beautiful, but it helps
Beautiful, but it helps
