Who am I supposed to be? 
I can't be sure that the next one will see me 

And if the sky starts falling on the street outside 
The only thing that satisfies 
If the sky starts falling on the heads outside 
The only thing that keeps me alive 

If you see her again, be sure to say hello 
Be sure to send my love 
Did she seem like before 
Could you seem above it all 
Be sure to send my love 

Wake up, waking up to see 
It's a sign 
That what will be will be 

And if the sky starts falling on the street outside 
The only thing that satisfies 
If the sky starts falling on the heads outside 
The only thing that keeps me alive 

I swear I heard her call, call my name 
I swear I heard her call, can I move on 

If you see her again, be sure to say hello 
Be sure to send my love 
Did she seem like before 
Can't you see above it all 
Be sure to send my love 

I swear I heard her call, call my name 
I swear I heard her call, can I move on 

Did she call herself a friend? 
Don't call on me again, don't call on me again 
Did she seem like before 
Did she seem above it all 
Be sure to send my love
