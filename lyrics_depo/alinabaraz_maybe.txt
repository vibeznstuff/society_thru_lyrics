What do I do when there's too much of me, too little of you?
What can I say when I know you're not here to stay?
I can't explain something I don't understand.
Why did I let this get out of hand?

Maybe I'll get you out of my head
Maybe I'll forget all the things you said
Lies on your lips, but there's love in your eyes
Maybe I'll forget you some other time

Why do I let you cross the line every time?
Why do I stay if I know you're not mine?
Right on your skin, I know that love used to glow
How can I let you go if I know I'm so close?

Maybe I'll get you out of my head
Maybe I'll forget all the things you said
Lies on your lips, but there's love in your eyes
Maybe I'll forget you some other time
