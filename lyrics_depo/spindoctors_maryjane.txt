Mary Jane, Mary Jane
Please don't leave me baby
I'll just find you again
I asked my uncle
If I could go
Yes, yes, go out and take
Mary Jane to the picture show
But Uncle Bob sighed
He could not answer
He died one second before
in the arms of a go-go dancer
Mary Jane, Mary Jane
Please don't leave me baby
I'll just find you again
I wanna roll you
Way down in the fields
Where you where born
I wanna roll you
When I'm ragged and forlorn
You have no friend
You have no pet
If there's anything better than you
You know they haven't found it yet
Mary Jane, Mary Jane
Please don't leave me baby
I'll just find you again
