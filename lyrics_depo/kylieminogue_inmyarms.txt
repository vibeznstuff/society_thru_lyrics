How do you describe a feeling?
I've only ever dreamt of this.

DJ's spinning up my favorite song,
Hurry up and get a grove on.
Light fantastic and it won't be long,
Don't let the moment slip away.

'Cause you and I could find a pleasure, no one else has ever known.
Feels like it is now or never, don't want to be alone

How does it feel in my arms?
How does it feel in my arms?
Do you want it?
Do you need it?
Can you feel it?
Tell me.
How does it feel in my arms?

Got a feeling this is something strong.
All I wanna do is move on.
No more wondering where I belong.
So never go away.

'Cause you and I are guilty pleasure, no one else has ever known.
Feels like it is now or never, don't want to be alone.

How does it feel in my arms?
How does it feel in my arms?
Do you want it?
Do you need it?
Can you feel it?
Tell me.
How does it feel in my arms?

Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Oh yeah, yeah 

Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Oh yeah, yeah 

I'm listening.
How does it feel in my arms?
(How does it feel in my arms?)
How does it feel in my arms?
Yeah, yeah.
Do you want it?
Do you need it?
Can you feel it?
Tell me.
How does it feel in my arms?
