Love was the egg 
See and it was born in a cloud with silver lining 
But it broke, I mean it hatched on the ground 
So time flew right by me and while I... 


I know you thought your life was goin be easy 
When you didn't call you found that you where wrong 
I know you thought your life was goin be easy 
You thought you had it all but you found that you were wrong 

See maybe there was something wrong 
And you weren't telling me no 
See maybe the laugh's on me 
And life was telling me a joke 

If something's yours and you let it go 
If it comes back to you it was yours all along 
When I let you go along with those lies from you 
I wonder what else lies in you 
Or did the lies just just eat gone



Hold it now! 
Is ya'll there? 
How you feel right now? 
Yeah me too 
Hey yeah! 
Hold it now! 
Ya'll all right? 

See do you remember 
what its like to wake up in her love nest 
get it love nest and now she's gone 
gone gone gone 

At which point you realize 
Life is but a joke and the laughs on you 
That's funny right
