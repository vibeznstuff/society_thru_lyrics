She spent the whole of last summer looking out for a six foot two
She gave them all a good chance, she was cool so she told em what to do
What she needs is a real special guy
And if you knew her you would never wonder why
When you see her now you see her with a six foot two
Oooh Oooh

She never takes a chance
She doesn't need romance
Her love is
Rock hard
She never takes a chance
She never dates or dance
Her love is
Rock hard Rock hard
She's rock hard

She goes around with her boyfriend hanging on her arm
No one gives her any lip no one does her any harm
All the other girls hanging in the hall
She's got the boys all wishing they could call
She starts making out, someone's ringing on the fire alarm
Oh Oh

She never takes a chance
She doesn't need romance
Her love is
Rock hard 
She never takes a chance
She never deigns to dance
Her love is
Rock hard Rock hard
She's rock hard
Whooa! Whooa!
