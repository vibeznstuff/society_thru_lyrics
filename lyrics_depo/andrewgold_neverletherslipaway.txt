I talked to my baby on the telephone long distance 
I never would've guessed I could miss someone so bad, yeah
I really only met her 'bout a week ago 
But it doesn't seem to matter to my heart 
I know that I love her 
I'm hoping that I never recover 
'Cause she's good for me 
And it would really make me happy 
To never let her slip away 

I feel like a kid with a teenage crush on a schoolday
(On a schoolday afternoon)
I feel like the lead in Romeo and Juliet, yeah
I'm a little bit dizzy, I'm a little bit scared 
I guess I never felt this much aware 
That I'd love her 
I'm hoping that I never recover 
'Cause she's good for me 
And it would really make me happy 
To never let her slip away

To never let her slip away 

Mm, I love her
I'm thinking that I never recover 
Yeah, she's good for me 
I know it's gonna make me happy 
To never let her slip away
Oh, I know it's gonna make me happy 
To never let her slip away
