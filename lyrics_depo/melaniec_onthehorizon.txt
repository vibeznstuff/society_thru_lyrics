People see different things
When they look on the horizon
Do you see dark clouds rolling in fast
Cos baby they ain't gonna last

And I can't see anybody else
I can't stop looking at you
Take this dream and make it true

All I see is love, sweet love
On the horizon, oh yeah
Just one look in your deep brown eyes
And baby I'm flyin'

This world could be so hard to take
Before I found you, I almost stopped trying
To see the good instead of the bad
But your hearts so true, that baby I'm cryin'

And every single time we meet
I learn what love is for
It's taking less and giving more

All I see is love, sweet love
On the horizon, oh yeah
Just one look in your deep brown eyes
And baby I'm flyin'

And baby I don't wanna see pain in your eyes
Cos you're the one that sets me free
There's nothing in this world that can hurt us
If it's you and me, hey-yeah-yeah

All I see is love, sweet love
On the horizon, oh yeah
Just one look in your deep brown eyes
And baby I'm flyin'

All I see is love, sweet love
On the horizon, oh yeah
(All i see is love on the horizon)
Just one look in your deep brown eyes
And baby I'm flyin'

I-I'm, flyin baby
(All I see is love on the horizon)
I-I'm, flyin baby

All I see is love, sweet love
On the horizon, oh yeah
Just one look in your deep brown eyes
And baby I'm flyin'
