It's murder on the dancefloor
But you better not kill the groove
Dj, gonna burn this goddamn house right down
Oh, I know I know I know I know I know I know 
About your kind
And so and so and so and so and so
I'll have to play
If you think you're getting away
I will prove you wrong
I'll take you all the way
Boy, just come along
Hear me when I say
Hey, It's murder on the dancefloor
But you better not kill the groove
It's murder on the dancefloor
But you better not steal the moves
Dj, gonna burn this goddamn house right down
Oh I know I know I know I know I know I know
that maybe others
And so and so and so and so and so and so
You'll just have to pray
If you think you'll get away
I will prove you wrong
I'll take you all away
Stay another song
I'll blow you all away
Hey, It's murder on the dancefloor
But you better not kill the groove
Murder on the dancefloor
But you better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna turn this house around somehow
Murder on the dancefloor
But you better not kill the groove
Hey, hey
Murder on the dancefloor
But you better not steal the moves
Dj, gonna burn this goddamn house right down
