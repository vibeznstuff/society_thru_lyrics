Doesn't matter how many times I try
Can't be without your love
So I'm not giving up, no 
5-4-3-2-1
Doesn't matter what's been said or done
Yeah I can make it right
Just let me love you one more time

I got liquor in my system
Feeling kinda wavy got me thinking 
Of all the things we used to do
Back then when I was still with you 
You were there for me from the start
When I didn't have a penny still had your heart
For me those feeling haven't changed
Need you back in my arms again

Southampton I was raised in the days 
Member' when you used to pick me up from raves in the days
Selling mix tapes instead getting grades 
In my barbers getting a quick fade and a shape 
What can I say? 
Didn't think these days that I'd be missing
Now I'm sitting at this table waved &amp; reminiscing.

Just let me love you one more time

(One more time 
One more time
One more time
Just let me love you one more time
One more time
One more time 
One more time
Just let me love you one more time)

I wanna' hold you, but it's from a distance
I don't know what to do, needing some assistance
I'll roll up to your mums house, I don't even business
Cos I'll do anything, cos maybe she'll help me fix this
So many man dem on your case, 
Really should have allowed it
I was nobody and you pick me out the crowd 
It took me this long just for me figure it out
But the simple fact is I'm lost girl, 
When you ain't around

So tell me baby
Is there hope for you and me?
Cos I just wanna have you back in my arms (back in my arms)
Kicking myself, it drives me crazy thinking bout, ya -
Counting all the nights and days you've been gone
