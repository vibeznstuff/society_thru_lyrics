Have you ever stood outside a picket fence
You can see through
But you can't get to the inside, oh
You sit there and wait
I look at you and anticipate
What we could be and what we could do

Fly the wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time
Fly the wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time

I'm carrying this heavy load
Don't know what to do
The only thing I know
Is I'm in love with you
Fly with the wings of an eagle
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you

Fly the wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time
Fly the wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time

No matter how high, no matter how low
I'll be thinking of you, oh
No matter what I do, no matter where I go
I'll be thinking of you, oh
No matter how high, no matter how low
I'll be thinking of you, whoa oh
No matter what I do, no matter where I go
I'll be thinking of you, oh
You'll be on my mind, oh

Fly the wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time
Fly the wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time
Oh

Fly the wings of an eagle
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time
Oh
You'll be on my mind all the time
Oh
You'll be on my mind
I'll be thinking of you the whole time
