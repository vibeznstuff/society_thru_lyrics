Chiddy Bang
And we pretty much amazing, can we hear your new song please? I got you
Hey yo I once was a kid all I had was a dream
Mo money mo problems when I get it I'm a pile it up
Now I'm dope, wonderbread we can toast
So fresh how we flow, everybody get their style from us
Hey yo I once was a kid with the other little kids
Now I'm ripping up shows and them fans going wild with us
Tell mummy I'm sorry, this life is a party

Remember you was a kid, reminisce, days of the innocence
Now it's Chiddy Bang, google me in the images
Follow me, follow me, I'm the leader
And when I park cars I don't pay for the meter
I remember I was younger as a kid it was the best
I used to touch on all the pretty girls at recess
I'm at my peak yes, I won't leave yet
Serial style, cereal aisle, I need chex
I can make these rappers run like a hard drill
Rock band show you how the guitar feel
And I could care less how ya'll feel
I got a flow that make a bitch do a cartwheel
This is that good, just puff it and relax bro
And you could get it free don't worry about the tax though
And Xaphoon, thank you for the crack
But I play a Ron Bergundy I anchor on the track like what

Hey yo I once was a kid all I had was a dream
Mo money mo problems when I get it I'm a pile it up
Now I'm dope, wonderbread we can toast
So fresh how we flow, everybody get their style from us
Hey yo I once was a kid with the other little kids
Now I'm ripping up shows and them fans going wild with us
Tell mummy I'm sorry, this life is a party, I'm never growing up

Can I please get a little bit of knowledge?
Somebody tell Roth that I don't love college
Cause the real world's kinda like Real World
And it's drama, so you are Svetlana
And I'm just a rhymer, swimming in the water
Trying to dodge the piranha, and fly to Bahamas
Pretty little mama, Chiddy in the spot
Where you at pearl lady? Show me what you got
They say why you rapping for the kids for
I say my clothes come fitted, the Lids store
This summer you can catch me on a big tour
I'm high grade, I think they need to quiz more
And let me get with ya, don't let the kid hit ya
I'm the photo album Valletta has, big picture
The rule is, the dude is, so up so chuck I'm a cool kid


Hey yo I once was a kid all I had was a dream
Mo money mo problems when I get it I'm a pile it up
Now I'm dope, wonderbread we can toast
So fresh how we flow, everybody get their style from us
Hey yo I once was a kid with the other little kids
Now I'm whipping up shows and them fans going wild with us
Tell mummy I'm sorry, this life is a party, I'm never growing up
