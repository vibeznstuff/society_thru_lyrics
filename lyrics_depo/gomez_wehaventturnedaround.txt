We came, we came, we came again
To stem the tide and point the blame
Came back for more, came back to see what you had in store
Everyone join the line, everyone

So, you wanna spin the world around
So, you wanna spin the world around
And anybody else, cut 'em down

So, you wanna make catastrophe
Won't you send it right over to me?
I got some time everybody running high

The same, the same, the same again
To steal the time and haunt the graves
Just because it's there don't mean you see it anywhere
Maybe it's a trick of the light, maybe

So, you wanna spin the world around
So, you wanna spin the world around
And anybody else, cut 'em down

So, you wanna make catastrophe
Don't you send it right over to me?
I got some time everybody come alive

So, you wanna spin the world around
So, you wanna spin the world around
And anybody else, bring 'em down

So, you wanna make catastrophe
Don't you send it right over to me?
I got some time everybody running high

So, you wanna spin the world around
So, you wanna spin the world around
And anybody else, cut 'em down

So, you say we haven't turned around
So, you say we haven't turned around
Just everybody else is going wrong, going wrong
