Show tonight
I hit all the notes that I know you like
You know I'm a pro when I'm on the mic
We're already here so turn off the lights, yeah

You had a lot to say
No more talking
You can use that mouth in other ways
'Cause want it now
I want it now
Now...

And I won't say it again
Oh you know I don't get naughty for anybody
I won't say it again
Even though this ain't the first time
I tell you one time
I ain't say it again

Time to time
What you been asking
Into actions
I won't say it again
I won't say it again

We go
Baby, give me all of that ego
You say it's food for thought
Let me feed you
This ain't even the half
It's the preview

I had a lot to say
I've been talking
I'm gonna throw it back like yesterday
'Cause I want it
And I want it now

And I won't say it again
Oh you know I don't get naughty for anybody
I won't say it again
Even though this ain't the first time
I tell you one time
I ain't gon' say it again

Time to time
What you been asking
Into actions
I won't say it again
I won't say it again

Oh you know I don't get naughty for anybody
Oh you know I don't get naughty for anybody
