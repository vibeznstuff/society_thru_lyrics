Come on


Natalie La Rose


I wanna rock with somebody (whoa, yeah)
I wanna take shots with somebody (shot, shot, shot, shot)
I wanna leave with somebody (somebody, come on, come on)
And we ain't gotta tell nobody, we ain't gotta tell nobody (nobody)


Why can't everybody know what's good
Cause some gon' hate what's new
We just do our thing, no time to waste
Always play it cool



And at the end of the night when the lights go out, will we turn down?
Oh, no, we won't
( We ain't never turn down, we ain't never turn down)
And when they try to make us leave we turn and say we never going home
( And you know just what I wanna do)




Why can't everybody know what's good
We are only plug
Bring us everything we think we need
Tonight is going up (tonight is going up)





And the club like, whoa
We'll be in the party in the club like, whoa
And the club like
We'll be in the city going down like, whoa

And the club like, whoa
We'll be in the party in the club like, whoa
Yeah, we'll be in the city going down like, whoa
We'll be in the party in the club like, whoa
