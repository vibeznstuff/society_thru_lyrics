M-A-dollar sign-E all over the world
Brandy all over the world
All over the world (2x)

I went from Helly Hanson to mini-mansions 
The girls in Aruba doing belly-dancings 
Spent half of my advancing 
Jaws from branson 
I make it through my circumstances 
But u know I'm wiser now 
Move like kaiser now 
gotta butter soft cover just to hide my pound 
gotta house in the valley 
Come and find me now 
Got enough dough to buy the town 
So I might give a 6 to my chick 
Benz to my mom 
Crib so big it look like the Sinigon 
Give a couch just to spill henny on
And Benadon since Lados and Benaton 

 

Some people say that I'm not the same girl 
They say that I think I'm in my own world 
What makes them think that I have changed 
A little dough cannot erase my problems 
Me like you I have to try and solve them 
Yes everything is quite the same 


I'm just trying to be me 
Doing what I got to do 
Some people think that I'm 
Just sittin on top of the world 
I'm just try to be me proving what I got to prove 
Some people think that I'm 
Just sittin' on top of the world 

I wonder why it's often said 
That my lifes a fairy tale and 
Everything is so right 
I wish that you could know the truth 
My life is real so please don't get it twisted 
Problems the same and got to be dealt with 
These are the things I wish you knew 

Always in someone's eye so many questions why 
How is it to be down with me with me 
Afraid to express myself always me and someone else 
I need to be free but its not that easy 



Don't understand why people 
Think I don't have friends 
Who knew me bad when 
This was my dream nothing has changed 
I still do the same things 

 

Yo,you can quit cookin short if it ain't about cake 
I ain't sittin on top I want a house on a lake 
I'm that snotty nosed cat with a new BM 
If you mess with Brandy I gotta bruise your chin 
I be with Puff the girls be like "Who's his friend?" 
If I hit a chick once you probably move me in 
So you gotta tell me right now 
Either your wit 
The cats that make the hits or the ones that see the chips (Slow down Mase 
your killin me) 
But don't stop it 
Whats the use of buying a weight if I'm a hav to chop it 
I use the let a lady till I learned the logics 
She only mess with Ma$e know the money aint an object 
If it ain't crissy he won't pop it 
If it ain't platinum with ice he won't rock it 
If it don't cost 60 he don't drop it 
If it don't come with TVs he won't cop it 
u can stop it , yea yea yea what what what?
