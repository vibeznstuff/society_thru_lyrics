Is it just dream?, Am I a fool for trying?
I stand defiant but my enemy's the tallest giant,
Will visions be reality? they tell me never,
I wanna feel the unity that Malcolm felt in Mecca,
I wonder if it made sense in his last moments,
People don't value the soul cause they can't hold it,
Find something real beyond death and misery,
And understand the present in the context of history,
It's been established Sykes-Picot was a bitter marriage,
Since the day Thomas Edward Lawrence tricked the Arabs,
I never back stab my people like Abu Mazen,
I'll overthrow the monarchs like Abdul Karim Qassem,
This is a battle that many better men have died fighting,
But I hope to give an insight through my writing,
My pen fires at the men who defend liars,
I send fire till the end of your empire,


We will fight to live,
We will not give up,
We will not give in,
We will rise,

And through the blood and tears,
We will not give up,
We will not give in,
We will rise,


Guess who's back, descendant of the occupied,
I represent the sentiments of many men you've colonized,
The President is eloquent but he's never been on my side,
Melanin's irrelevant cause everything was prophecised,
There was a time when they talked about the Arab Nation,
Broke our good leaders replaced them with a pack of masons,
Took your Keffiyeh and changed it to a fashion statement,
You sat with Satan, Camp David means assassination,
Peace in your imagination, that's not real,
I've been where Arafat got poisoned and Sadat got killed,
I'm not a martyr, just a man without a Masters or a master,
Trying to unite the people like Abdul Nasser,
This is a battle that many better men have died fighting,
But I hope to give an insight through my writing,
My pen fires at the men who defend liars,
I send fire till the end of your empire,


We will fight to live,
We will not give up,
We will not give in,
We will rise,

And through the blood and tears,
We will not give up,
We will not give in,
We will rise,


If you're my brother, you're my brother but please be loyal,
Comrades for life till we're deep in soil,
They came to the middle east told us we need royals,
Just ask Mossadeq about BP Oil,
Look at history, the pecking order you will discover,
Nationalize your resources watch your children suffer,
Are you still my brother?
Even if BAE Systems gives us weapons to kill each other,
I strike back at the empire till it falls,
Most of us invest our money in building walls,
Mark the words of the lyricist that's written this,
Any money that I do make will build a bridge,
This is a battle that many better men have died fighting,
But I hope to give an insight through my writing,
My pen fires at the men who defend liars,
I send fire till the end of your empire,


We will fight to live,
We will not give up,
We will not give in,
We will rise,

And through the blood and tears,
We will not give up,
We will not give in,
We will rise.
