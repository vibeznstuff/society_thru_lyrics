Oh yeah
Ya wanna find it
Come on yeah

I'm on a plane, with cocaine
And yes I'm all lit up again
Cough up love, and touch up
Your mama said packing lines is sin

And yes I'm all lit up again
On the couch, in my bed
And yes I'm all, lit up again, flying
I love the cocaine, I love the cocaine
Mama can you wait, mama can you wait, yeah

I'm on a train, and ride on
You know the train is staying off the track
I'm in touch love, from this crutch
Well you're on ten, but honey I'm on eleven

And yes I'm all lit up again
On the couch, in my bed
And yes I'm all, lit up again, flying
I love the cocaine, I love the cocaine
Mama can you wait, mama can you wait
I love the cocaine, I love the cocaine
Mama can you wait, oh can you wait long?

Well crack the door for the curious girl cause she's been waiting, she's been waiting
Chop a line for the fiending man 'cause he wants one
You know, you know you got to, can you feel it can you feel it tonight, are you high love, tell me are you fucking high?
In the moment you are just so right
You're right love, are you right love?

And yes I'm all lit up again
On the couch, in my bed
And yes I'm all, lit up again, flying
I love the cocaine, I love the cocaine
Mama can you wait, mama can you wait
I love the cocaine, I love the cocaine
Mama can you wait, oh can you wait long?

Oh yeah
Don't wanna fight that
Alright, yeah
