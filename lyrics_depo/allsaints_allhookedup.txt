C'mon on, c-c'mon
(Say what, say what)
Yo yo, there she go
Go girl with your fine ass

You keep askin' for my time
You keep tellin' me, that I'm fine!
Give me your number
I wont call!
Give me your pager too
Not at all will I call, not at all

I know that you want a piece of my ass,
Don't you know that a guy like you wouldn't last?

Not a player - don't get paid!
I'll leave you hangin' (I'll leave you handin') for days
Don't send me flowers, they wont do (no, no, no, no)
Don't give me diamond rings, cos I'll take them and call you a fool!

C'mon why you do me like that?
Cant you see that I wanna feel that?
C'mon why you do me like that?
Cant you see that I wanna feel that?

Why's this fool all up in my ass?
Doesn't he know I wont class my trash?
Why's this fool all up in my ass?
Doesn't he know that I got my own cash?

I know that you want a piece of my ass
Don't you know that a guy like you wouldn't last?
Look, don't touch, you're askin' much!

Why's this fool all up in my ass?
Doesn't he know I wont class my trash?

Doesn't he know that I got my own cash?

Na na baby
Na na baby
Na na baby
You want what you cannot have

I know that you want a piece of my ass
Don't you know that a guy like you wouldn't last?
Look, don't touch, you're askin' much!

I know that you want a piece of my ass
I'm all hooked up. You're outta luck!
Don't you know that a guy like you wouldn't last?
Look, don't touch, you're askin' much!
