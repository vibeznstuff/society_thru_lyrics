What you waiting for, days?
What you waiting, what you watching the skies up above 
What you waiting the holes are for water let the fall 
Let the clothes in let the clothes on 
Keep your clothes on
Wherever you look, 
Wherever, you look happy 
I feel dazed, I feel disoriented 
With a pineapple head
Walks in the sun
With a friend the mouse, with a friend the shadow
War machine ... war machine
Wrap her arms ... wrap her arms around me
War machine ... war machine
Come to wrap her arms, tight around her body
She moves fast ... she moves slow
She move down into the water ... I remember her
I remember her
I was leaving you
What you looking for babe
Your voice, I'm not incredible 
Your voice is in desperation
I hear you
I hear bleeding

Between her arms are tight ... 
Wrapped around her body ...
She moves fast, she look down ...
She won't look in my eyes ...

I remember her now ... 
Her unnatural surprise

What you waiting for, days?
What you waiting, what you watching the skies up above 
What you waiting the holes are for water let the fall 
Let the clothes in let the clothes on 
Keep your clothes on
Wherever you look
Wherever, you look happy 
I feel dazed, I feel disoriented
With a pineapple head
Walks in the sun
With a friend the mouse, with a friend the shadow
War machine ... war machine
Wrap her arms ... wrap her arms around me
War machine ... war machine
Come to wrap her arms, tight around her body
