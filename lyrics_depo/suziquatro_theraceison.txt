Go ahead and laugh at me, try to be the man you oughta be
Baby it's not hard to see what's going on
Well maybe we should celebrate, drink champagne, why should we wait
Why don't we ask some friends around, they can help us play this game we found
Let's bring everybody down
Will we ever be ready for what we're heading for

Here we stand like a couple of fools and the race is on
Hand in hand as we break the rules and the race is on
What's the cost to the one who lost when the race goes wrong
You may say why begin when we both can't win, but the race goes on
Hand in hand like a couple of fools and the race is on

Well surprise surprise, a few more lies, or do we simply call them alibis
This life we lead aint fooling either one of us
And while we're having so much fun let's not forget the lonely ones
It's lonely falling out of love, this game we play can be so rough
Now maybe we've gone far enough
Are you sure you know just what where heading for

Here we stand like a couple of fools and the race is on
Hand in hand as we break the rules and the race is on
What's the cost to the one who lost when the race goes wrong
You may say why begin when we both can't win, but the race goes on
Hand in hand like a couple of fools and the race is on

Here we stand like a couple of fools and the race is on
Hand in hand as we break the rules and the race is on

You may say why begin when we both can't win, but the race goes on
Hand in hand like a couple of fools and the race is on

The Race Is On
