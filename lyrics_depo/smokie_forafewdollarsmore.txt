Rich girl she buys her dreams.
It's a rich world behind the scenes.
Green eyes they tell it all.
The more she takes the harder they fall.
She ain't easy and she ain't tough.
She's had it good, but then she's had it rough.
And I guess it don't come to much.
Cos with everything she's got she's never got enough.


So she'll cry just a little for a few dollars more.
She'll lie just a little like she's done it before.
She'll take it, she'll fake it for a few dollars more.
She'll show you her heart, then show you the door.
You know she'll die just a little for a few dollars more.
Even fly just a little like she's done it before.
She'll take it, she'll fake it for a few dollars more.
She'll show you her heart, then show you the door.

Strange things can happen to you.
When you've got so much and you've got nothing to do.
Oh oh oh what do you know.
How do you get there when there's nowhere to go.
And so you wonder just what she'll do.
She's never known love but then she's never known you.
And it's too bad those sad green eyes.
Are so full of questions and so full of lies.
