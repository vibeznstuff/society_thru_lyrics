I know a girl with the golden touch
She's got enough, she's got too much
But I know, you wouldn't mind
You could have it all if you wanted
You could have it all if it mattered so much
But then all they know is how to put you down
When you're there, they're your friend
But then when you're not around
They say, "Oh, she's changed"
We know what they mean
Well they mean, they're just jealous
Because they never do the things
That they wish that they could do so well

That kind of girl, yes she's never alone
You leave a thousand messages on her phone
But you know you never get through
And you could have it all if you wanted, girl
You could have it all if it matters to you

But then all they know is how to put you down
When you're there, they're your friend
But then when you're not around
They say, "Oh, she's changed"
Oh we know what that means
Well it means they're just jealous
But they'll never do the things
That they wish that they could do so well

I saw my girl with the golden touch
Give me a taste but not too much
I never listen to the words of fools
Well, well, hey, you
You won't get it that way
But don't ask for too much
You're gonna need your golden touch

Because all they know is how to put you down
When you're there, they're your friend
And then when you're not around
They say, "Oh, she's changed"
And we know what that means
Well it means they're just jealous
But they'll never do the things
That they wish that they could do so well
