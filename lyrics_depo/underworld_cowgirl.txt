Everything...
I'm invisible...
An eraser of love...
Why don't you call me I feel like flying in two...
I'm invisible...
An eraser of love...
Why don't you call me I feel like flying in two...
An eraser of love...

I scream, I scream, I scream so much...
You know what I mean. this electric stream.
And my tears in league with the wires and energy and my machine.
This is my beautiful dream.
I'm hurting no one. hurting no one...
I want to give you everything.
I want to give you energy. I want to give a good thing.
I want to give you everything. everything...
In one final scream of love who could climb this high she looks beautiful
Like a child I feel tears. and I want to scream.
You know what I mean cause this is hurting no one. an erazor of love.

Hurt. the necessary feeling.

Why don't you call me I feel like flying in two...
An erazor of love.
