Just seven numbers
Can straighten out my life
But my pride won't let me phone
Just seven numbers
Can get me through to you girl
Then I'll know you're really at home
You haven't been fair to me
Playing all that you see
You say you seen some of the act
I don't know that you're a coming back
If I only knew where you were
Just seven numbers
Can straighten out my life
If my fingers would only turn the dial
Just seven numbers can make me blue girl
Just your hello would make me smile
I haven't been fair to myself
I'm trying to call somebody else
But as soon as she said hello
I hung up the telephone line
If I only knew where you were
Just seven numbers
Can put me straight through to you
I never knew
Baby, wo-o-o
Just seven numbers
Can straighten out my life
But my fingers won't turn the dial
Just seven numbers
Can put me straight through to you babe
Just your hello would make me smile
