When I fall, you're my place to land.
I lose my touch, you're my hands,
The one I hold on to.
If you run out of reason to try
I'll love enough for both you and I
I'll be the one you can run to.

I'd rather go through any pain love puts us through
Than to spend one day without you by my side.


If you ever leave me, will you take me with you?
If you're ever lonely, I wanna be lonely too.
My home's beside you, no matter where you may go.
My love's inside you, even more than you know.


In a world of anger and lies
I find peace in your eyes
A flame in the darkness.


Ooh, And through all space and time
'Til every star refuses to shine


You know where my heart is.
I'd rather go through any pain love puts us through


Than to spend one day without you by my side
If you ever leave me, will you take me with you?
If you're ever lonely, I wanna be lonely too, Woah.
My home's beside you, no matter where you may go.


Where you may go


My love's inside you, even more than you know.

And I can't remember life without you
The way it used to be
Feels like a million years away.


Well Hold me 'til the angels sing.


Tell me every little thing.


Promise me forever from this day

If you ever leave me, will you take me with you?
If you're ever lonely, I wanna be lonely too, Woah.
My home's beside you, no matter where you may go.


Where you may go


My love's inside you, even more than you know.


Even more than you know.


Even more than you know.


Even more than you know.
Even more than you know.
