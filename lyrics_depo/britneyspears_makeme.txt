Friday, I'm dreaming a mile, a minute
'Bout somebody, this feeling, I wanna go with it
Cause there's no way, we're hiding away from this tonight
Oh, this tonight
Can tell you want me by the way I see you starin'
'Cross the room, babe, no shame in the game, just cut the shit
Be honest, yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight
Do tonight

Just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (Oh, yeah)

And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

No rules, from the bar to the car, let's take it back
To my room, igniting the heat of the moment
Let those sparks fuse, blowing up to the ceiling, we're burning bright
When we cut the line
Cause you're the flame I can't do without
The fire comes in, the sky falls down
There's no way I'm gonna be fighting this tonight
This tonight

I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (Oh, yeah)

And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, because
You're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh


Yeah, Eazy
I don't care if it's a random person or the biggest star
Out in Vegas or little bars
Really not a difference if it's near or far
Listen, here we are, need you
I've always wondered what was off limits
Staring at you till I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this is all tennis
I'm all jealous, you came with someone
But we can tell that there's changes coming
See I could tell that you're a dangerous woman
That means you're speaking my language, come on
Now follow me, let's go
Like Penelope in "Blow"
Well it worth the stealing you, it's a felony, yeah I know
That's why they keep on telling me to let go, yeah

But I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
To give you something sensational
So let's go, yeah
Said I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
So follow me and I can make you


And make me ooh (move), ooh, ooh (yeah), ooh
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, because
You're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, you make me ooh
