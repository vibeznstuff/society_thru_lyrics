We cut our teeth on radio waves and trash TV
We find ourselves in superstars and rebel yells
We fight like hell to not be like our parents
We know so well they never felt these feelings

Blame it on our generation
Never happy, tired of waiting
Driving our lives into the ground
Cause we're too busy chasing down
Ecstasy and expectations
That's what they say about kids these days
Some things'll never change
Kids these days

Misunderstood, saving the world, up to no good
History replays, youth is passion, pride and pain
They shake their fists for what they think we've ruined
Quick to forget they've done just what we're doing

Blame it on our generation
Never happy, tired of waiting
Driving our lives into the ground
Cause we're too busy chasing down
Ecstasy and expectations
That's what they say about kids these days
Some things'll never change
Kids these days

We get so lost in translation
Walking through a teenage wasteland

Blame it on our generation
Never happy, tired of waiting
Driving our lives into the ground
Cause we're too busy chasing down
Ecstasy and expectations
That's what they say about kids these days
Some things'll never change
Kids these days
That's what they say about kids these days
Some things'll never change
Kids these days
