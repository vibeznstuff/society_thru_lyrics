Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Black and orange stray cat sittin' on a fence 
Ain't got enough dough to pay the rent 
I'm flat broke, but I don't care 
I strut right by with my tail in the air 

Stray cat strut, I'm a (Ladies' cat)
I'm a feline Casanova (Hey, man, that's where it's at) 
Get a shoe thrown at me from a mean old man 
Get my dinner from a garbage can

Yeah, don't cross my path 

I don't bother chasing mice around, oh, no
I slink down the alley looking for a fight 
Howling to the moonlight on a hot summer night 
Singin' the blues while the lady cats cry
"Wild stray cat, you're a real gone guy
I wish I could be as carefree and wild
But I got cat class, and I got cat style"
