As I write my letter today
Tears start falling from my eyes
I remember
Things we used to say
And the ties that bind
Our love

Only one thing
I want to do
Come home (whoa, yeah)
Come home
Long as I know
I'm coming home to you
I'm coming home

Please remember
While I'm away
I think of you night and day
Of the things
Of the fun
While we were one

Only one thing
I want to do
Come home
Come home
Long as I know
I'm coming home to you

I didn't think a-it ever be, whoa, whoa, as bad as it's been, no, no, no
But now I'm coming home
To give you a ring

As I write my letter today
Tears start falling from my eyes
I remember
Things we used to say
And the ties that bind
Our love

Only one thing
I want to do
Come home (whoa, whoa, yeah)
Come home
Long as I know
I'm coming home to you

Only one thing
I want to do
Come home (whoa, whoa)
Come home
Long as I know
I'm coming home to you
