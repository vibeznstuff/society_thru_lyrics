There go the street lights - the night's officially on,
I got the green light - to do what ever we want,
Gonna stand - outside - the box - and put the rules on hold,

Tonight
Carte blanche, first class for the evening
Ready, set, go

All the girls stepping out for a public affair
(All night, that's right 'cause the party don't stop)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares, let's rock, 'cause the party don't stop)

Hey Baby, I see you looking over here baby
Are you gonna keep looking - or get up?
And talk to me
Here's an opportunity that you don't wanna miss tonight

...got plans first class for the evening

Ready. Set. Go.

All the girls stepping out for a public affair
(All night (all night), that's right (that's right) 'cause the party don't stop (don't stop, ooh))

Do what you wanna do, tonight the world does not exist
No, no, no, no
Move how you wanna move, all my girls work it out - like this

Give me room to shake, shake, shake
