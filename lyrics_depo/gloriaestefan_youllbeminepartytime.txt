When the sun is setting in the sky
Everybody knows it's party time
And when the moon is
Rising high
I'll be yours, I know you will be
Mine (party time)

All day the world goes round
&amp; round
You can feel the changes
Coming down
It doesn't matter who you are
With love to give you will go far

We see the treasures all around
And burn ourselves into
The ground
Everyone's is trying to survive
We're not just born to be alive

I know
What I feel inside is true
You know
Every road I follow's leading
Me to you

When the sun is setting in the sky
Everybody knows it's party time
And when the moon is rising high
I'll be yours, I know you'll be mine
(party time)

We live our lives in mystery
While everything is meant to be
No reason here to wonder why
All that we seek is in the sky

You are the one I want to hold
I feel you deep inside my soul
Only our love will set us free
This night belongs to you and me

I know
What I feel inside is true
You know
Every road I follow's leading me to you

When the sun is setting in the sky
Everybody knows it's party time
And when the moon is rising high
I'll be yours, I know you'll be mine
(party time)

I know, you know
Every road I follow's leading me to you

When the sun is setting in the sky
Everybody knows it's party time
And when the moon is rising high
I'll be yours, I know you'll be mine

When the sun is setting in the sky
Everybody knows it's party time
And when the moon is rising high
I'll be yours, I know you'll be mine
