Put on those shades
And wave to yesterday
The sunlight hurts my eyes


Sunlight hurts my
Sunlight hurts my
Sunlight hurts my
Sunlight hurts my
Sun, sun, sun, sun, sun...

Sunlight hurts my eyes!
The sunlight hurts my eyes!
The sunlight hurts my eyes!
The sunlight hurts my eyes!
Don’t look to the skies!

Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes

Put on those shades
And wave to yesterday
The sunlight hurts my eyes


Put on those shades
And wave to yesterday
The sunlight hurts my
The sunlight hurts my eyes!
The sunlight hurts my eyes!
The sunlight hurts my eyes!
The sunlight hurts my eyes!
Don’t look to the skies!

The sunlight hurts my eyes!
The sunlight hurts my eyes!
The sunlight hurts my eyes!
The sunlight hurts my

The sunlight hurts my eyes!
The sunlight hurts my eyes!
The sunlight hurts my eyes!
Don’t look to the skies!

The sunlight hurts my eyes!
