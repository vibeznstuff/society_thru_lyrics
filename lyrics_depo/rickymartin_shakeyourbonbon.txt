I'm a desperado underneath your window.
I see your silhouette. 
Are you my Juliet? 
I feel a mad connection with your body. 
Shake your bon-bon, shake your bon-bon, shake your bon-bon. 

I wanna be your lover, your only latin lover. 
We'll go around the world in a day. 
Don't say no, no. 
Shake it my way, oh shake your bon-bon, 
shake your bon-bon, shake your bon-bon. 


Hola Amiga, hola Amiga. 
You're my temple of desire. 
We'll go around the world in a day. 
Don't say no, no. 
Shake it my way, oh shake your bon-bon, 
shake your bon-bon, shake your bon-bon. 

You're a Mata Hari. 
I wanna know your story. 
In the Sahara sun I wanna be the one that's gonna come and take you, 
make you shake your bon-bon, shake your bon-bon, shake your bon-bon. 
Up in the Himalayas, c'mon I wanna lay ya. 
We'll go around the world in a day. 
Don't say no, no. 
Shake it my way, oh shake your bon-bon, 
shake your bon-bon, shake your bon-bon.
