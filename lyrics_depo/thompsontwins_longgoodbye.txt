I have seen my future die
My whole past as well
That hurricane she knew my name
And tonight just feels like hell

You left me
Wanting
So much more
When your love has gone away
It's a long goodbye

Sometimes I see you dancing there
In the fading light
But when I look again you've gone
The poppies all run wild

You left me
Wanting
So much more
When your love has gone away
It's a long goodbye
Such a long goodbye

I screamed with the wind
I howled at the rain
I even prayed
But nothing I do and nothing I say
Will bring you back again
No, no, no

When your love has gone away
It's a long goodbye

A thousand questions never asked
I'm left wondering why
So many secrets never shared
Guess I'll keep them 'til I die

You left me
Wanting
So much more
When your love has gone away
It's a long goodbye
It's a long goodbye

When your love has gone away
It's a long goodbye
When your love has gone away
It's a long goodbye
When your love has gone away
It's a long goodbye
(Such a long goodbye)
When your love has gone away
It's a long goodbye
(Such a long goodbye)
When your love has gone away
It's a long goodbye
When your love has gone away
It's a long goodbye
When your love has gone away
It's a long goodbye
(Such a long goodbye)
When your love has gone away
It's a long goodbye
