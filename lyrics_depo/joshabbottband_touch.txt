A little longer, baby stay with me a little longer.
I just want your touch again, to feel your body giving in.
It’s pulling at me, my desire to make you happy.
I want to feel your touch again.

Let’s just lie here together chasing forever.
I can’t get enough of your love.
Brave and relentless, sweet and defenseless,
I can never get enough, every time we touch.

Can’t stop staring, my eyes keep taking off what you’re wearing.
I just want your touch again, to feel your body giving in.
You’re a bad liar, that smile gives away what you desire,
You wanna feel my touch again.

Let’s just lie here together, chasing forever.
I can’t get enough of your love,
Brave and relentless, sweet and defenseless.
I can never get enough, every time we touch.

Yeah let’s lie here together chasing forever,
I can’t get enough of your love.
Brave and relentless, sweet and defenseless,
I can never get enough, every time we touch.
Every time we touch.
