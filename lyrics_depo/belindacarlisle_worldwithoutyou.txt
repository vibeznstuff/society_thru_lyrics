If there was no sunshine
I could learn to live with the rain
Darling if I had to
I could trade pleasure of pain

I could live without foot or money
Wouldn't be so hart to do
And if the stars fell down from the sky
Baby I would make it through!

But in a world without you
Where would I be
Where would I be without you babe
In a world without you
Where would I be
Where would I be without you babe
I could breathe without you babe

Wouldn't be no music
No reason to laugh, no reason to smile
Couldn't call it living
Without nothing to make the living worthwhile

You know that it would all seem worthless
If you weren't here with me
I could have the world in my hands
Nut I wouldn't have a thing

Baby - it would all be worthless
If you weren't with me
I could have the world in my hands
But I wouldn't have a thing
