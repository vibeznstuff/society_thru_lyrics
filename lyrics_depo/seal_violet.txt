I watch you comb your hair in different light
You change the chair and seem to think that's alright
I understand
You need a change
When you make that change
Don't look to see
I'm alright
Now that I look at you in different light
Change the chair
A violet unicorn to me that's alright
I understand
You need a change
The world will elevate you world will elevate you
and when you make that change the world will elevate you
And if I told you then that I could cry
Would you take my tears and wash the sunrise 
A man afraid has no shame
So when you take those tears don't look to see I'm alright
look to see I'm alright
When you take those tears don't look to see I'm alright
look to see I'm alright
How can I tell you
How can I explain
I want your love I need a change
In me
Ba-da ba-da ba ba-da
Ba-da ba da
