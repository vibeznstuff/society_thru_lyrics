Was it me?
Was it you?
Was it all the little things that i didn't do?
Trying to move on
But i can't
No i can't imagine being
Someone else's man


Girl i've tried and tried a million times
To get you off my mind
It's not that easy
It's not that easy
Don't you know how hard it is for me
To smile and say goodbye
It's not that easy
It's not that easy

It's not over
Not for me
Used to have so much faith and i still believe
You're my weakness
You're my strength
And one without the other
Just don't make no sense



It's not as easy for me as it is for you
Let me talk about it
It's not that easy
What am i meant to do without your love, your love?
What am i meant to do without your love?



Don't you know how hard it is for me
To smile and say goodbye
It's not that easy
It's not that easy
