'Love is being friends,' she says
'Going on and on' she says
'True love never ends,' she says
'I don't believe a word'
She says, 'I don't believe a word'

'Love is now for me,' I say
True love needn't come to stay
It can come and slip away
Believe me when I say
That love is strictly for today

Love is many things to many people
I just know what it means to me
Love is 'tie me down' to many people
For me, if it's right, then it's got to be free

I can't look ahead to say
Tomorrow I'll still feel this way
Who knows what games we both might play?
But this I'm gonna say 'I'll love you forever Today'

On and on today, Never ending today
I'll love you forever today
