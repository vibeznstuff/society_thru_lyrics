Here is a rainbow for your hair
Here is another sign of the times
We live we die
We laugh we cry
We know not why
Lipstick 'n leather wear 'n tear
Of another sign of the times
We're chained and bound
Hard lines, crack down
On stony ground
Here is a taste of here and now
Red is the bloody sign of the times
The bride stripped bare
Of all despair
We're cut but we don't care
Here is a rainbow for your hair
Here is another sign of the times
Light up in anger I'll be there
Fight for a sign of the times
We live we die
We laugh and we cry
We know not why
Bent on a life between the lines
End on a sign of the times
