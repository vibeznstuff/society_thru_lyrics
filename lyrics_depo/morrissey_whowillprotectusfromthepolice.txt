Say Daddy, who will
Protect us from the police?
Say Daddy, who will
Protect us from the police?
"Baby, God will!"

Say Daddy, who will
Protect us from the police?
Say Daddy, who will
Protect us from the police?
"Baby, God will!"

Say Daddy
There are flames high in the sky tonight
Tanks on the street
Attacking free speech
We must pay for what we believe
We must pay for what we believe
We must pay for what we believe
We must pay for what we believe
We must be killed for what we believe

Say Daddy
I'm sorry
I just cannot believe you
Say Daddy
I'm sorry
I just cannot believe you
So what should I do?
What should I do?

"Baby please run
You were right all along!
Baby, please run
Baby, please run!"
