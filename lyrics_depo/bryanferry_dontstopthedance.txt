Mama says truth is all that matters
Lying and deceiving is a sin
Drifting through a world that's torn and tattered
Every thought I have don't mean a thing

Don't stop, don't stop the dance
(No) More music (Don't stop the dance)

Mama says love is all that matters
Beauty should be deeper than your skin
Living for the moment, lips and lashes
Will I ever find my way again?

Don't stop, don't stop the dance
(No) More music (Don't stop the dance)

Don't stop, don't stop the dance

Mama says only stormy weather
Don't know why there's no sun in the sky
Footsteps in the dark come together
Got to keep on moving or I'll die

Don't stop, don't stop the dance
(No) More music (Don't stop the dance)

Don't stop, don't stop the dance
(No) More music (Don't stop the dance)

Don't stop, don't stop the dance
