Winter's cityside, crystal bits of snowflakes 
All around my head and in the wind 
I had no illusions that I'd ever find 
A glimpse of summer's heatwaves in your eyes
You did what you did to me
Now it's history I see 
Here's my comeback on the road again 
Things will happen while they can 
I will wait here for my man tonight
It's easy when you're big in Japan 

When you're big in Japan, tonight 
Big in Japan, be tight 
Big in Japan, where the Eastern sea's so blue 
Big in Japan, alright 
Pay, then I'll sleep by your side 
Things are easy when you're big in Japan 
When you're big in Japan...

Neon on my naked skin 
Passing silhouettes 
Of strange illuminated mannequins 
Shall I stay here at the zoo 
Or shall I go and change my point of view 
For other ugly scenes 
You did what you did to me
Now it's history I see
Things will happen while they can 
I will wait here for my man tonight
It's easy when you're big in Japan

When you're big in Japan, tonight 
Big in Japan, be tight 
Big in Japan, oo the Eastern sea's so blue 
Big in Japan, alright 
Pay, then I'll sleep by your side 
Things are easy when you're big in Japan 
When you're big in Japan, tonight 
Big in Japan, be tight 
Big in Japan, oo the Eastern sea's so blue 
Big in Japan, alright 
Pay, then I'll sleep by your side 
Things are easy when you're big in Japan 
When you're big in Japan 

When you're big in Japan, tonight 
Big in Japan, be tight 
Big in Japan, oo the Eastern sea's so blue 
Big in Japan, alright 
Pay, then I'll sleep by your side 
Things are easy when you're big in Japan 
When you're big in Japan
