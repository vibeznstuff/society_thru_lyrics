Some friends of mine and me stayed up all through the night
Rockin' pretty steady till the sky went light
And didn't go to bed
Didn't go to work
I picked up the telephone
Told the boss he was a jerk

Your mama don't like it when you run around
With me
But we got to hip your mama
That you got to live free
Don't need her. Don't need school
You don't like your daddy and you don't like rules

So, c'mon baby let's go
Don't you hear the rock 'n' roll playin' on the radio
Sound so right?
Girl your better grab hold
Everybody's got to know
Anything that's rock 'n' roll's fine
Anything that's rock 'n' roll's fine


Oh oo oh my little baby
I'm a little bit shakin'
I'm a little bit crazy
But I know what I want
I wanna it right now
While the 'lectric guitars are playin' way up loud

C'mon baby let's go
Don't you hear the rock 'n' roll playin' on the radio
Sound so right?
Girl your better grab hold
Everybody's got to know
Anything that's rock 'n' roll's fine
Anything that's rock 'n' roll's fine
