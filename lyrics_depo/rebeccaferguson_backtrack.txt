I can't
Go along with it
You can say just what you like
But you still did it

You backtrack and change your act at a hundred lies a minute
But fool as I am I won't go along with it

Am I confused
Am I a crazy person
You say it's' old news she doesn't mean nothing
But don't you understand that I am heartbroken
No matter what you do you just can't make it untrue

You're breathing lies I want to believe in
When I'm watching you walk out the door I could fall through the floor

I can't
Go along with it
You can say just what you like
But you still did it

You backtrack and change your act at a hundred lies a minute
But fool as I am I won't go along with it

Too much to lose and it's still raining
I know it's not a game
So ill stop playing
But oh my hearts on fire and it keeps burning
And I don't mean to cry
It's just the smoke gets in my eyes

You're breathing lies I want to believe in
When I'm watching you walk out the door I could fall through the floor

I can't
Go along with it
You can say just what you like
But you still did it

You backtrack and change your act at a hundred lies a minute
But fool as I am I won't go along with it

Let the battle drum start
I wanna turn back the clock
I wanna find the missing pieces of the whole love I lost

You say it like you mean it
And I want to believe it
Cause I can't stop this feeling

I can't
Go along with it
You can say just what you like
But you still did it

You backtrack and change your act at a hundred lies a minute
But fool as I am I won't go along with it
