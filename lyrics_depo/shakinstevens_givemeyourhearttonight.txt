Oh tonight - I'm walking the streets again

Runnin' away from all of my teasin' friends.
Oh tonight - the stars are in darkened skies

They don't hold all the love
I can see in your lonely eyes.
Cause I'm not waiting for a secret

I don't want to hear a lie.
Don't want the promise of tomorrow

Give me your heart tonight.
Too young - too young to start settling down

I'm getting too old
too old to keep running around
Oh
your love is something I don't wanna miss.
End up alone and livin' on a one night kiss. 
Cause I'm not crying without reason

I'm not asking what is right.
Tust like the changin' of the season

Give me your heart tonight.
Cause I'm not waiting for a secret
. . . 
Cause I'm not crying without reason
. . .
Cause I'm not crying without reason
. . .
