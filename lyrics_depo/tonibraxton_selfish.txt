Well, it's too late for givin' in
I've been waitin' for too long
There's no way that I could lose
Givin' me the love you've been holding back
Today I'm not gonna wait
Not anymore, the time is now
I'd give up everything
Just to have you for myself
Cuz when I think about it

Your love, your kiss
I never felt anything like this
You're sent from above 
I'm so in love
When I think about it
Your touch, your smile
I never felt anything like this
And I know it's real
It's just the way that I feel
I'm just a little bit

I'm selfish
I don't wanna share you with anybody else
Don't want them hugging you
Touching you, feeling you, kissing you
You could call me selfish

I'm selfish
I don't want to share you with anybody else
I don't want no one around you
Calling you, paging you
You can call me selfish

Should I stop trippin' and let it flow?
It happened a long time ago
Damn, boy you hurt me so
When you cheated on me with that other lady
Well, I felt embarassed and ashamed
And to top it, you called out her name
Keep thinking I'm the one to blame
Still, I took you back
When I think about it

Your love, your kiss
I never felt anything like this
You're sent from above 
I'm so in love
When I think about it
Your touch, your smile
I never felt anything like this
And I know it's real
It's just the way that I feel
I'm just a little bit

I'm selfish
I don't wanna share you with anybody else
Don't want them hugging you
Touching you, feeling you, kissing you
You could call me selfish

I'm selfish
I don't want to share you with anybody else
I don't want no one around you
Calling you, paging you
You can call me selfish

There are reasons why I care
The way you love me seems so unreal
There are times when I feel scared
Cuz you had a girl when we first met
I close my eyes and pray
That you would be more truthful baby
Be the love of my lifetime
Say that you'll be mine

I'm selfish
I don't wanna share you with anybody else
Don't want them hugging you
Touching you, feeling you, kissing you
You could call me selfish
