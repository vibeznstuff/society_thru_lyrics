(It's all right, all right...)

So many times has it all been said and done
But in the end it's the fight that's just begun
Understand that it's days like these
When the world is so hard to please
In you, my heart has found a home

'Cause it's not about me
It's not about who I want to be
It's not about you
You know that we are better off as two

'Cause we are, we are, we are, we are more
Yeah, we are, we are, we are, we are more
Together (It's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right)
Together (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right)
Together

These games, they will always end the same
'Cause neither you or I will take the blame
Sometimes we go too far
But I like it the way we are
Right here, I give your heart a home

No, it's not about me
It's not about who I want to be
It's not about you
You know that we are better off as two

'Cause we are, we are, we are, we are more
Yeah, we are, we are, we are, we are more
Together (It's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right)
Together (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right)
Together

It's not about me
It's not about who I want to be
It's not about you
You know that we are better off as two

'Cause we are, we are, we are, we are more
We are, we are, we are, we are more
Together (It's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right)
Together (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right)
Together

'Cause we are, we are, we are, we are more
We are, we are, we are, we are more
Together (It's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right)
Together (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right, all right)
It's all right (it's all right)
Together
