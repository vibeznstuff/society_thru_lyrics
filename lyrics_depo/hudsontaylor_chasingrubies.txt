Take me away to some place else
'Cause I don't want to see you with anybody else
Maybe I'm selfish, I don't know
I hardly know you
And I don't want to let you go
And I don't want to let you go

This is not deja vu
I've never met somebody like you
I'd like to tell you the truth
I hardly know you
And I don't want to let you go
And I don't want to let you go

Chasing rubies, chasing gold
I'd like to tell you before you're told
Maybe I'm crazy, I think so
I hardly know you
And I don't want to let you go
And I don't want to let you go

This is not deja vu
I've never somebody like you
I'd like to tell you the truth
I hardly know you
And I don't want to let you go
And I don't want to let you go

What if you don't like me
What if I'm being naive
Maybe it's love, sure I don't know
I hardly know you
And I don't want to let you go
And I don't want to let you go

This is not deja vu
I've never met somebody like you
I'd like to tell you the truth
I hardly know you
And I don't want to let you go
And I don't want to let you go

And I don't want to let you go 

This is not deja vu
I've never met somebody like you
I'd like to tell you the truth
I hardly know you
And I don't want to let you go
And I don't want to let you go

This is not deja vu
