You sheltered me from harm
Kept me warm
Kept me warm
You gave my life to me
You set me free
Set me free
Of all the years I ever knew
Those finer ones I spent with you
I would give everything I own
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
You taught me how to cry
I don't know why
I don't know why
You told those lies to me
You set me free
Set me free
If there's someone you know
That won't let you go
And is taking it all for granted
You may lose them one day
Someone take them away
And you don't hear a word they say
