You came into my life without a single thing
I gave into your ways, but you left me with nothing
I've given into smiles, I've dealt with all your games 
I wish you're happy now, I had to let you win 

Why don't you get the fuck out of my face, now!! 
Why don't you get the fuck out of my face, now!! 

In the sea of life, you're just a minnow 
You live your life insecure 
I feel the pain of your needles 
As they shit into my brain 

I scream without a sound 
How could you take away everything that I was? 
Leave me a fuckin slave 
Your face that I despise 
Your heart inside that's gray 
I came today to say, you're fucked in every way 



In the sea of life, you're just a minnow 
You live your life insecure 
I feel the pain of your needles 
As they shit into my mind 
You stole my life without a sigh 
You sucked me dry
