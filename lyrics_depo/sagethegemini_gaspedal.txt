Holy shit!


Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make yo ass fall off
Hella thick, I wanna smash 'em all, now
Speed up, gas pedal , now

Speed up, gas pedal 
(Look, ah)


Black money, let them ho's say amen
I'm just tryna make it clear boy Ray-Bans
I'm a great man, whoa, say it friend
I play a whole late night DJ amen
Room full of boppers, tell them give me topper
Beat it, beat it up, now no one hit the coppers
I'm S-A-G-E, who would like to know?
Fe-fi-fo-fum, large me in yo throat
West-side, baby, do what you do
And you gotta tell what that shit do
It's, pretty nigga mobbing, just the way that I grew
I'd be steppin' up in the club, then make 'em drop to my shoe
And you mad cause I spoon, but I don't give a fork
Silverware a nigga out if he actin' a poor sport
Use a door, grab a girl, and get a yankin'
Got a booty like hoops, I'm tryna make it,
Whoa


Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make yo ass fall off
Hella thick, I wanna smash 'em all, now
Speed up, gas pedal
Gas pedal, gas pedal
Gas pedal, gas pedal
Speed up, gas pedal
Gas pedal, gas pedal


She a trick for a dollar bill
And her boyfriend a bitch, call him Tyler Perry
Eugh, I'm in a black bat, lookin' scary
On my way to the cake, no bake-ery
Oops, bakery, never been no fake in me
Lead her to the bathroom, she askin', "Where you takin' me?"
Uh, tell her "Slow down, baby,
I'm too turnt up, it's finna go down, baby"
When you hit the stage, the people do a 180
When I hit the stage, man, the club wanna pay me
Uh, you niggas so fugazzi
Got a white bitch with me, call that hoe slim shady, uh
Nigga 'su so crazy
Got two hoes with me, make my old bitch hate me, uh
All about my payment, you say we gettin' money, that's an understatement, uh


Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make yo ass fall off
Hella thick, I wanna smash 'em all, now
Speed up, gas pedal
Gas pedal, gas pedal
Gas pedal, gas pedal
Speed up, gas pedal
Gas pedal, gas pedal
