Churaliya he (Stolen) 

You were my eyes when i couldn't see,
you were my air when i couldn't breathe,
but you always knew what you meant to me,
(yeaah.ah,ah)
You were my strength when i was down,
and you made me humble when i wouldn't bow,
I held on to your promise that you'd be around,
(ah,ah...ah,ah)

Where were you when i was alright,
tell me, did you knew I was alright,
you, left me thinking I'd be alright,
wont you come back to me,
Ohhh..
It's crazy but i'm falling apart,
It's crazy how your leaving me scarred,
It's crazy girl wherever you are,
you stole, my heart

It's crazy but I'm going insane,
feeling lost confused and ashamed,
It's crazy, hope your feeling my pain,
you stole, my heart

(Stolen)
Just like a moment....
(Stolen)
you never owned it,
(Stolen)
you took away my heart,

I was feeling lost in my own world,
neglecting your needs only once girl,
If only we could try again once more,
ohhh..(Ohh..)
Now It's the same sad story that we all know,
how lovers make mistakes watch it all blow,
now i don't wanna be the one to let it all go.... nooo



(Stolen)
Just like a moment....
(Stolen)
you never owned it,
(Stolen)
you took away my heart,
(ah,ah...ah,ah..)

No man can live without blood running through his veins,
(through his veins)
and it's hard to remember the summer now here is rain
I don't know how much longer that i can wait
It's a thin line... between love and hate,
Oh-whoa-whoaaaa...

It's crazy but i'm falling apart,
It's crazy how your leaving me scarred,
It's crazy girl wherever you are,
you stole, my heart

It's crazy but I'm going insane,
feeling lost confused and ashamed,
It's crazy, hope your feeling my pain,
you stole, my heart

(Stolen)
Just like a moment....
(Stolen)
you never owned it,
(Stolen)
you took away my heart,
(ah,ah...ah,ah..)

(Stolen)
Just like a moment....
