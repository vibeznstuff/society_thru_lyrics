I'm in love
Ooh and I love the feeling
Hey, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
And I love the feeling

The sun seems to shine all the time in my mind
Since I met you, baby
All my cares and all my fears are far behind

Hey, I'm in love
Ooh and I love the feeling
I tell you I'm in love
Ooh and I love the feeling

I've got a song in my heart, just one look, that's all it took
I was hooked from the very start
And the feeling's wonderful, marvelous, heavenly
You're ecstasy

Hey, I'm in love
Ooh and I love the feeling
I tell you I'm in love
Ooh and I love the feeling

Now listen, I feel like a child on Christmas morning
That must truly be a miracle
'Cause I feel like I've been born again
I'm a happy man, yes, I am

My heart feels light like a bird in flight
I won't need no air, yeah, yeah
From head to my toe, don't you know I'm all alone
I feel ten foot tall

And it's all because I'm in love
Ooh and I love the feeling
I tell you I'm in love
Ooh and I love the feeling

I'm a happy man, yes, I am
'Cause I've got a girl
Wouldn't trade her for the world, yeah, yeah

Hey, I'm in love
Ooh and I love the feeling
Hey, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
And I love the feeling

She's never hard to find
'Cause she's always on my mind, yeah, yeah

Hey I'm in love, ooh
