She hurt my head oh mama
Oh oh oh but my eyes won’t leave her
I go head over heels for TINA
My cheerleader, she’s my diva oh

She hurt my head oh mama

It’s Fuse
AY!

She hurt my head oh mama

Eeii
OK
It’s a worldwide movement
Killbeatz let’s go

There ain’t no rain or no barrier to stop her loving her baby o, o yeah
There ain’t no storm or no hurricane to stop her hugging her baby o
(No way)
Even when the sea come carry me go my TINA go come and save me o, o yeah
Not even the walls of Jericho can stop her touching her baby o
(That’s why I’m loving my lady o)

Even when harm comes round my way
It’s like your arms is where I lay
Because I feel you when you pray
And I already know I’ll be ok 

She hurt my head oh mama
Oh oh oh but my eyes won’t leave her
I go head over heels for TINA
My cheerleader, she’s my diva oh


Love the way she holds me
Telling me old stories
Like Nelson Mandela and truth behind Tripoli
Love the way she holds me
When I’m down and lonely
Makes me feel all better
Telling me no don’t you worry

Since I came out the womb o
Mama gave me my room o
She be numero uno
I want the whole world to know
Since I came out my mama womb o
TINA gave me my room o
She be numero uno
I want the whole world to know

She hurt my head oh mama
Oh oh oh but my eyes won’t leave her
I go head over heels for TINA
My cheerleader, she’s my diva oh

Tina na na na na yeah

(oh oh yeah yeah)
Tina na na na na oh

(oh oh yeah yeah)
Tina na na na na yeah

Na na oh na na na yeah


She hurt my head o mama
Still I love the way that she holds me
