Someday, one day,
Time's not so far away,
We can share the dreams we've had.
Oh, someday, ooh-ooh-ooh!

Hey, there, look in the mirror.
Tell me, what do you see before you?
I see someone to be proud of,
I see someone that I love.

Someday, one day,
Time's not so far away,
We can share the dreams we've had.
Oh, someday, ooh-ooh-ooh!

People say you're a dreamer.
What do they know of what you're thinkin'?
If you believe in what you're doin',
Then believe in what I say.

Someday, one day,
Time's not so far away,
We can share the dreams we've had.
Oh, someday, ooh-ooh-ooh!

I know you feel discouraged;
Sometimes things move very slowly.
And I know that you feel like movin',
Feel like goin', feel like doin'.

Someday, one day,
Time's not so far away,
We can share the dreams we've had.
Oh, someday; oh, someday; oh, someday.
