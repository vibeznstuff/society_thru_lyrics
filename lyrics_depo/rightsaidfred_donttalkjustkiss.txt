Ah
surrender me a kiss

let me loose on you inch by inch.

The one and only reason is fun
fun
fun.
I said "Well baby
we've only just begun".
So don't talk
just kiss

we're beyond words and sound.
Don't talk just kiss

let your tongue fool around

let's fool a round.

Ooh yeah
there's people
there's love

you and I both apply to the above.

The one and only reason is fun
fun
fun.
I said "Well baby
we've only just begun".
So don't talk
just kiss

we're beyond words and sound.
Don't talk just kiss

let your tongue fool around.

Ah ha
we're wasting precious time

don't talk
kiss
ahh
and make it mine.

The one and only reason is fun
fun
fun.
I said "Well baby
we've only just begun".
So don't talk
just kiss

we're beyond words and sound.
Don't talk just kiss

let your tongue fool around.

Come on
come on
come on
come on
fool around.
Come on
come on
come on
come on
fool around.
Come on
come on
come on
come on
fool around.
(Surrender your love to me!)

So don't talk
just kiss

we're beyond words and sound.
Don't talk just kiss

let your tongue fool around.

So don't talk
just kiss

we're beyond words and sound.
Don't talk just kiss

let your tongue fool around

let's fool around
