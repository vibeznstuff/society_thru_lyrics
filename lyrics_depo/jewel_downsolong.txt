Sun sets' cross the ocean
I'm a thousand miles from anywhere
My pocketbook and my heart both just got stolen
And the sun act like she don't even care
The wind blows cold when you reach the top
It feels like someone's face is stuck to the bottom of my shoe
I got a plastic Jesus, a cordless telephone for every corner of my room
Got everybody but you telling me what to do

But I've been down so long
Ooh, it can't be longer still
I've been down so long
That the end must be drawing near

I look to everybody but me to answer my prayers
'Til I saw an angel in a bathroom who said she saw no one worth saving anywhere
And a blind man on the corner said it's simple, like flipping a coin
Don't matter what side it lands on if it's someone else's dime

But I've been down so long
Ooh, it can't be longer still
I've been down so long
That the end must be drawing near

I take a trip, I catch a train, I catch a plane
I got a ticket in my hand
And then a fat man takes my money
And like cattle we all stand

But we've been down so long
Ooh, it can't be longer still
We've been down so long
The end must be...
Oh, I know the end must be...
Oh, I know the end must be drawing near
