Do, do, do, do-do-do,
Do, do, do, do-do-do,
Do, do, do, do-do-do,

Today,
I'm laughing the clouds away,
I hear what the flowers say,
And drink every drop of rain,
And I see,
Places that I have been,
In ways that I've never seen,
My side of the grass is green,
Ooh I can't believe that it's so simple,
It feels so natural to me,

If this is love,
Then love is easy,
It's the easiest thing to do,
If this is love,
Then love completes me,
Cause it feels like I've been missing you,
A simple equation,
With no complications,
To leave you confused,
If this is love, love, love,
Hmm it's the easiest thing to do,

Do, do-do-do, do, do,
Do-do-do, do do,
Do-do-do, to you,
Feel the way that I do?
Do I turn your grey skies blue?
And make dirty streets look new?
Hmm and the birds sing,
Tweeheeheeheeheeheeheet,
Tweedleedeedeedee,
Now I know exactly what they mean,
Ooh I can't believe that it's so simple,
It feels so natural to me,

If this is love,
Then love is easy,
It's the easiest thing to do,
If this is love,
Then love completes me,
Cause it feels like I've been missing you,
A simple equation,
With no complications,
To leave you confused,
If this is love, love, love,
Hmm it's the easiest thing to do,

Do, do, do-do-do, do, do,
Do-do-do, do, do,
Do-do-do, do, do,
Do-do-do, do, do,
Do-do-do, do, do,
Do-do-do, do, do,

Wooh ooh ooh wooh ooh ooh oooh!
Wooh ooh ooh wooh ooh ooh oooh!
Wooh ooh ooh wooh ooh ooh oooh!
(What is it you want, Mary?
What do you want?
You want the moon?
Just say the word and I'll
Throw a lasso around it and
Pull it down. Hey. That's a
Pretty good idea. I'll give
You the moon, Mary.)

Oooooh no,
If this is love,
Then love is easy,
It's the easiest thing to do,
If this is love,
Then love completes me,
Cause it feels like I've been missing you,
A simple equation,
With no complications,
To leave you confused, No,
If this is love, love, love,
It's the easiest thing to do,

Do, do, do-do-do, do, do, (Hey!)
Do-do-do, do, do,
Do-do-do, do, (oooh this is love love love love love love)
Do, do, do-do-do, do, do, (oooh this is love love love love love love)
Do-do-do, do, do,
Do-do-do, do
