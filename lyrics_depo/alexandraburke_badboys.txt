(Bad Boys, Bad Boys)
Alexandra Girl I know what you like
(Bad Boys, Bad Boys)
Oh, oh (Bad Boys, Bad Boys)
Hey, yeah (Bad Boys, Bad Boys)


Some people call them players
But I’m far from terrified
Cos somehow I’m drawn to danger
And have been all of my life
It feels my heart’s divided
Half way ‘tween wrong and right
I know I’m playing with fire
But I don’t know why

Yeah the bad boys are always catching my eye
(Ooh Way, Ooh Wah)
I said the bad boys are always spinning my mind
(Ooh Way, Ooh Wah)
Even though I know they’re no good for me
It’s the risk I take for the chemistry
With the bad boys always catching my eye
(Ooh Way, Ooh Way, Ooh Wah)
Oooooh, bad boys

Some think it’s complicated
But they’re straight up fun for me
I don’t need no explanation
It’s nothing more than what you see here
My heart still feels divided
Halfway ‘tween wrong and right
I know I’m playing with fire
But I don’t know why

Yeah the Bad Boys are always catching my eye
(Ooh Way, Ooh Wah)
I said the bad boys are always spinning my mind
(Ooh Way, Ooh Wah)
Even though I know they’re no good for me
It’s the risk I take for the chemistry
With the bad boys always catching my eye
(Ooh Way, Ooh Way, Ooh Wah)


I know you want me shawty cos I’m a (bad boy)
Hey s-shawty can’t help it she so so addicted to them rougher fellas
With even the alphabet she only sings the crooked letters
Let mamma take all the risks
For that chemistry she like them tougher than leather
Not even the paws, it´s more like a mama bee,
Out lost that´s on the reg´ler,
By any means necessary, girl
She likes them ruthless, that’s my world
It’s not the news it’s what I heard
To get them more the merrier
It’s not a big surprise
I know them bad boys catch your eyes
Look at her walk when I go in disguise
You’ll have them shawty don’t worry you fly


Yeah the Bad Boys are always catching my eye
(Ooh Way, Ooh Wah)
I said the bad boys are always spinning my mind
(Ooh Way, Ooh Wah)
Even though I know they’re no good for me
It’s the risk I take for the chemistry
With the bad boys always catching my eye
(Ooh Way, Ooh Wah)
Yeah the Bad Boys are always spinning my mind
(Ooh Way, Ooh Wah)
I said the Bad Boys are always catching my eye
(Ooh Way, Ooh Way, Ooh Wah)
