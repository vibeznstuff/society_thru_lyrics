I'm falling, I'm falling
Falling in love with you

Baby, Come closer closer to me, And listen listen so carefully
Remember all the nights that I told you that I loved you
It wasn't true, I used you, And you were just someone new

To thrill this lonely heart of mine
I was lying all the time
Pretending to be falling in love with you
But it's different now, I've kissed you now
So forgive me forgive me somehow

Hold me tight for tonight, Then tell me truth
If you still love me, Say that you love me
Don't leave me now

Now that I'm falling for you
I'm falling, I'm falling
Falling in love, Falling in love with you
