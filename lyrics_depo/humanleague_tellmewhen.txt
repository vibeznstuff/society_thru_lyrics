Tell me when
Will I?
Tell me when
Will I?
Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Tell me when

Kelly took a lifetime
Searching for the bottom line
I wasn't into searching
'Cause I was doing fine
I wasn't into fighting, chasing
Sweating, slaving, fretting, racing
Any waste of effort
Isn't part of my design
Billy was an inspiration
Positive and kind
Until he let confusion
Overcome his youthful mind
Common sense dictated
I could never be so blind
And then
Then I see you

Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Happenstance an episode unplanned
Alone in time
Coincidence, the second chance
Re-sounding like a rhyme
How paths may cross against the odds
To wreck the plans you made
Among the crowd a face that smiles
To melt your masquerade
If only I could see you
Says the stranger deep inside
And lets you know that when you were
So sure you really lied
If only I could see you
Says the voice within your brain
And quietly, insistently
It says it once again
And then, I really need to know

Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Tell me when
Tell me when

It wouldn't seem so lonely
If only I could see you
Baby, you can be free
If only I could see you
You'll never have to doubt me
If only I could see you
Baby, you could free me
If only I could see you
If only I could see you

Tell me when
Tell me when
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?

Then
I really need to know

If only if only if only I could see you
If only I could see you
If only if only if only I could see you
Will I see you again?
If only if only if only I could see you
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?
If only if only if only I could see you
Will I see you again?
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

If only if only if only I could see you
Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Tell me when
Will I see you again?
If only if only if only I could see you
Tell me when
Will I see you again?

If only if only if only I could see you
If only if only if only I could see you
If only if only if only I could see you
