Turn around every way, looking back another day
The race is on, I'm out to win, before I start I must begin

Here we go round in circles to nowhere
Mulberry bush just won't let me see
If I am lonely when I arrive there
Mulberry bush, will you shelter me when I am naked and cold?
Yet no one must see, oh they're looking at me
When I am straight I feel that my world is real

With people running round and round, bringing one another down

People running round and round, bringing one another down

Here we go round, I'm looking for someone
Mulberry bush is calling to me
Red lights and green ones, I can't be nervous
Mulberry bush, your bright eyes I see

Here we go round in circle to nowhere
Mulberry bush just won't let me see
If I am lonely when I arrive there
Mulberry bush, will you shelter me?
