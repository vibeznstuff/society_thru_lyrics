You can look, but you can't touch 
I don't think I like you much 
Heaven knows what a girl can do 
Heaven knows what you've got to prove 

I think I'm paranoid 
And complicated 
I think I'm paranoid 
Manipulate it 


Bend me, break me 
Anyway you need me 
All I want is you 
Bend me, break me 
Breaking down is easy 
All I want is you 

I fall down just to give you a thrill 
Prop me up with another pill 
If I should fail, if I should fold 
I nailed my faith to the sticking pole 

I think I'm paranoid 
Manipulate it 
I think I'm paranoid 
And complicated 


Paranoid 
I think I'm paranoid 


Steal me, deal me, anyway you heal me 
Maim me, tame me, you can never change me 
Love me, like me, come ahead and fight me 
Please me, tease me, go ahead and leave me 

Bend me 
Break me 
Anyway you need me 
As long as I want you baby it's all right 

Bend me 
Break me 
Any way you need me 
As long as I want you baby it's all right.
