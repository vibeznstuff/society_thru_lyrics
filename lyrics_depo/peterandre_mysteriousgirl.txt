Baby girl, i said tonight is your lucky night, 
Peter Andre along wid Bubbla Ranks on de mic.

I stop and stare at you 
Walking on the shore
I try to concentrate
My mind wants to explore
The tropical scent of you
Takes me up above
And girl when i look at you
Oh i fall in love
No doubt you look so fine
Girl i wanna make you mine 
I want to be with a woman just like you
No doubt i'm the only man
Who can love you like i can 
So just let me be with the woman that i love
Baby girl... Shine like a looking glass
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Mysterious girl
I wanna get close to you
Oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh, oh
Mysterious girl
Move your body close to mine
Girl you are me heart's desire 
And you alone a set me soul on fire
Me tell dem
Girl you are me heart's desire
And you alone... watch dis
Watching the sun go down
The tide is drifting in 
We can get closer now
And feel the warmth within
cos i'm looking in your eyes
Feeling so alive
And girl when you touch me 
It's time to take it through the night
Girl i wanna be with you
I wanna spend the night with you
i need to be with the woman that i love
Girl i wanna do to you 
All the things you want me to
I need to be with the woman that i love
Baby girl... let your loving release
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Mysterious girl
I wanna get close to you
(So close to you my baby)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Mysterious girl
Move your body close to mine
Well i've been sitting by the phone hoping you'd call
When time me hear your voice I feel ten feet tall
Body weh you have a make de man dem a bawl
Man a trip over man when time your name call
Your pretty looks surround me like a flowers a bloom
And I love the smell of your Elizabeth Taylor perfume
Your personality alone light up de room
Just one kiss alone a make me heart go boom
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Mysterious girl
I wanna get close to you
(c'mon now, c'mon now)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Mysterious girl
Move your body close to mine
