Last night I dreamt you were lying beside me
I smelt the sweetness of your hair
You gently reached out to remind me
Of how it used to be
And I almost believed that this morning I'd find you still there


But here in the real world 
I miss you madly 
In the real world 
I'm coping badly with losing you
What am I to do 
Here in the real world 
Without you

Last night I dreamt of a different ending 
Everything just seemed to work out somehow
I saw that someday I could smile again without pretending 
In was so sure I'd wake up and I wouldn't need you right now



Friends tell me I must not look back 
There are silver rails just ahead on the track 
And my stars say I'm getting over the fact that you're gone 



I'm here in the real world 
Without
