I give you everything but me
Everyone around you twisted fame 
I can't control you and your look
You silly freak you super fuck
I can't believe whose wide you're on 
Everyone around you layed with dogs
Like a bitter pill that's lost its taste
I'll take the whole thing anyway

I don't love you, you don't love me
But I can imagine
Like a little theif without a key
WellI can imagine

I'll take the world blow it away
Send all your hopes to outer space
I can't control you and your look
You silly freak you super fuck
I can't believe whose side you're on
Everyone around you layed with dogs 
Like a bitter pill that's lost its taste
I'll take the whole thing anyway

Like a hurricane that lost his speed
I can imagine
Like a liquored mind I've gone insane
And I can imagine
