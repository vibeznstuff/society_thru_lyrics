You invite me to a war party
me no wanna go.
Everybody seem to be inviting me to - a war party
me no wanna go.
Heard about the last one
so thanks but-no
thank you
you.
You killed off all the Indians
and you killed off all the slaves.
But no quite
so you killed off the remains.
You a look for me
and I'm looking for you.
I can't believe what they say about you is true.
That you're a bad star just like Pharoah.
You killed the children just like Pharoah.
Now you send a ticket for me
it don't have R.S.V.P.
Oh Lord
it's a war party
me no wanna go...
You've invited all our wise men many time before
To dance around your fires and even out your scores.
And when the tolls taken of the valiant and the brave

The only decoration is the one upon the graves.
Oh no
you're a bad star just like Pharoah

You killed the children just like Pharoah.
Now you send a ticket for me
and it don't have R.S.V.P.
Oh Lord
it's a war party
me no wanna go...
Please don't send no ticket for me
no
don't send no ticket.
No
don't send no ticket for me
if don't have R.S.V.P.
Oh Lord
it's a war party
me no wanna go...
Do you wanna go
say no
do you wanna go
say no.
Me no wanna go right now
me no wanna go right now.
They invite me to a war party me no wanna go...
