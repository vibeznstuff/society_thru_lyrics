There was a little drawing of a heart next to that,
Followed by an exclaimation mark.
The back of his was covered in stuff... stuff like...
Brandon is not a very nice guy, but Alex is sooo nice.
And that had the exclaimation thing too.
It was just silly crap that hit the spot. And he let himself be drawn in.
You bring light in...
To a dark place
Walking in light
Glowing walking in light
Gold ring around you
The hues of you
The golden sunlight of you
You bring light in...
Cool wind following
Following after you
Rising for you
Your skin beautiful
Everything comes natural
Fantastic fan
Rocking rocking floating
