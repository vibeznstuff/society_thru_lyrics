Standing at the bar with my friend Olivia
We were trying our best to catch up
That's when he walked over, said I'd like to get to know you
But all I could say was, look, I'm sorry love
You see, I've had difficulties too many times before
And right now it's not really my thing
He said just give me two minutes of your time
And tell me would you like me to be your friend

It's not that easy, it's not that easy
These days can't find a man to please me
Their lines are far too cheesy
No boy is on a level, believe me
No boy is on a level, believe me
These days can't find a man to please me
No boy is on a level, believe me
These days can't find a man to please me

You don't have to have a lot of money,
All you got to have is fire burning deep in your soul
If you have a dream for something that you love
I'll support you, yeah I'll play my role
Now I won't call you twenty times a day
'Cause I've got my own shit to do
When you see my name flashing on your phone
I want you to feel butterflies coming on through

It's not that easy, it's not that easy
These days can't find a man to please me
Their lines are far too cheesy
No boy is on a level, believe me
No boy is on a level, believe me
These days can't find a man to please me
No boy is on a level, believe me
These days can't find a man to please me

Now one thing I can't stand is arrogance
There's no way that we would ever get along
But one thing I love is confidence
And humility to know when you've been wrong
Now I love a bad boy mentality
But I don't want to be visiting no jail
Just know if there's someone out there mocking me
Be my gangster when it's time to get real

It's not that easy, it's not that easy
These days can't find a man to please me
Their lines are far too cheesy
No boy is on a level, believe me
No boy is on a level, believe me
These days can't find a man to please me, no
Oh these days I can't find my, my easy please me
