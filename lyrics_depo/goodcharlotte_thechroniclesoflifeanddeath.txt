You come in cold,
You're covered in blood.
They're all so happy you've arrived.
The doctor cuts your cord.
He hands you to your mom.
She sets you free into this life.
And where do you go with no destination, no maps to guide you.
Wouldn't you know that it doesn't matter, we all end up the same.

These are the chronicles of life and death and everything between.
These are the stories of our lives, as fictional as they may seem.
You come in this world, and you go out just the same.
Today could be the best day of your life.

And money talks in this world, 
That's what idiots will say
But you'll find out that this world, 
Is just an idiots parade
Before you go, you've got some questions.
And you want answers
But now youâ€™re old, cold, covered in blood, 
right back to where you started from

These are the chronicles of life and death and everything between.
These are the stories of our lives, as fictional as they may seem.
You come in this world, and you go out just the same.
Today could be the worst day of your life. 

But these are the chronicles of life and death and everything between.
These are the stories of our lives, as fictional as they may seem.
You come in this world, and you go out just the same.
Today could be the best day of, 
Today could be the worst day of,
Today could be the last day of your life.
It's your life, your life.
