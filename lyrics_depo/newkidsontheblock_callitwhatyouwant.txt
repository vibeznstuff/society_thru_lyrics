I can tell you've been watching me, girl, I've been watching you too. 
I got the feeling you want my love, I must admit, I want your love too. 
Call it what you want, baby, girl, I call it love. 
Call it what you want, darling, I still call it love. 

You know there's something about you, girl, what it is it's kind a hard to say. 
I only wish we could get away, give me love, and I'll lead the way. 
Call it.... 

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na. Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na. 
It's so groovy just to be with you. 
It's so good, babe, just to dance or anything that you wanna do. 
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na. Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na. 
I can feel it, I can feel it, I can feel it, I can feel that love, girl. 
It's so groovy just to be with you. 
It's so good, babe, just to dance or anything that you wanna do. 
Call it what you want, I'll still call it love. 
Call it anything that you want to, girl, I'll still call it love. 
You can call it this, you can call it that, you can call it anything, girl. 

Call it....
