We queuing up the tills, Wishing for our lives to change
Just a piece of something new, A taste would keep us sane
Hypocrisy in every day, Drills a hole deep in our brains
Searching for a little hope, A rainbow when it rains
Sitting on an empty bench, Got these nails dug in my skin
Like a leopard with his kill, We're going under, slipping in
Under the Water, Don't think we'll recover
Twisted and broken, 10,000 leagues choking
Sinking deep under, don't think we'll recover
Day in Day Out
Stepping on a treadmill wheel, You must know how that can feel
Blows a fuse inside our minds, Watch the data as it wipes
Taste the bullshit on a plate, We just piss our lives away
Get the hell out while you can, We going under, sinking in
We're going under, slipping in
Under the Water, Don't think we'll recover
Twisted and broken, 10,000 leagues choking
Sinking deep under, don't think we'll recover
Day in Day Out
We're going down, yes we're going down, we're going down:.
Taste a new amphetamine, Alcohol has sucked us in
Introverted in our ways, Trapped inside this plastic skin
Now its rears it's ugly self, Feeds us full of selfish doubt
We've got to keep ourselves afloat, Going under, get me out
We're going under, slipping in
Under the Water, Don't think we'll recover
Twisted and broken, 10,000 leagues choking
Sinking deep under, don't think we'll recover
Day in Day OutWe're going under, slipping in
Under the Water, Don't think we'll recover
Twisted and broken, 10,000 leagues choking
Sinking deep under, don't think we'll recover
Day in Day Out.
