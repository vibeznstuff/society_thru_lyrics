All I want for Christmas is a whole bunch of stuff
But anything that you can buy me won’t be enough
Because everything I’m hoping for is intangible
Like free health care and gun control


If you wanna make the world a better place
Say alright (alright) alright (alright)
If you wanna peaceful world for Christmas day
Say alright (alright) alright (alright)


Christmas is here
I know what I want this year
Presents and toys are fine
But I got bigger things in mind
Santa can you swing more love? More peace?
Because that’s what everybody needs
Come save the world with me


Santa Claus stop by the ghetto too
And bring lots of opportunity with you
Bring the day the government will realize
We’ll all be happier when it’s legalized
So immigrate, stop the hate, let’s educate
The more we do, the less we will incarcerate
7 billion people just below the moon
And if we come together, oh, the things that we could do


If you wanna make the world a better place
Say alright (alright) alright (alright)
If you wanna peaceful world for Christmas day
Say alright (alright) alright (alright)


Christmas is here
I know what I want this year
Presents and toys are fine
But I got bigger things in mind
Santa can you swing more love? More peace?
Because that’s what everybody needs
Come save the world with me


What do you want for Christmas?
I just want peace for everybody on earth
What about you?
I want hope for everybody
Tayjon?
I think I want homes for the homeless
Alina?
I want water for everybody
Yaay


All I want for Christmas is to have a chance
So please take care of the environment
Take Mr. Gore seriously
And do what you can to stop global warming
No matter what they say, Barack you did real good
I hope that your successor
Does the things he or she should
That Mr. Trump, he’s an entertaining guy
But let's face it, really is he qualified?


If you wanna make the world a better place
Say alright (alright) alright (alright)
If you wanna peaceful world for Christmas day
Say alright (alright) alright (alright)


Christmas is here
I know what I want this year
Presents and toys are fine
But I got bigger things in mind
Santa can you swing more love? More peace?
Because that’s what everybody needs
Come save the world with me
