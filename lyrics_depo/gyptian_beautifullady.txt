Just the other day
Said I ran into this beautiful lady
She asked me my name 
And I told her it's Gyptian
Immeadiately she said 
Boy I gotta give you sumthin from her body
And I said Baby quickly
She said don't want you to tell nobody
Dhat I gave it to you so easy
I said With me baby ya don't need to worry

She said Ohh and Ahhh
She never felt so right
I said Yes my baby

Woman of my dreams
You have become reality
Part of my subconsciousness
And my immortality

Because I have you for my girl
And I promise you my baby
I'm gonna take you on tours around the world

She said Ohh and Ahh
She never felt so right
