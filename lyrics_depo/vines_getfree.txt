I'm gonna get free 
I'm gonna get free 
I'm gonna get free 
Ride into the sun 
She never loved me 
She never loved me 
She never loved me 
Why should anyone? 

(Come here, come here, come here) 
I'll take your photo for ya 
(Come here, come here, come here) 
Drive you around the corner 
(Come here, come here, come here) 
You know you really oughta 
(Come here, come here, come here) 
Move out of California 

Get (get) 
Me (me) 
Far (far) 
When I have alot to lose 
Save (save) 
Me (me) 
From (from) 
Here! (here) 

When it's pretty time 
Look into your mind 
Don't wait 

I'm gonna get free 
I'm gonna get free 
I'm gonna get free 
Ride into the sun 
She never loved me 
She never loved me 
She never loved me 
Why should anyone? 

(Come here, come here, come here) 
I'll take your photo for ya 
(Come here, come here, come here) 
Drive you around the corner 
(Come here, come here, come here) 
You know you really oughta
