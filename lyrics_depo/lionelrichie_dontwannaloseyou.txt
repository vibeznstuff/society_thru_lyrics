You know it's taken a long time to realize
How much I love to be with you
Times are hard, spirits weak
Everything seems to be going wrong
Outlook's bleak
You know I fooled around playing the field
That's when I found that your love was real
No I haven't treated you so right
But I won't lose your love without a fight


I'm gonna hold on to the love we have together
Hold on don't you say good-bye
Tell me now before we lose forever
Girl I don't want lose
Gotta have your sweet loving
'Cause without it girl I'll just lost my mind

The way you hold me
Comforts me and shows me
That a love like yours is hard to find
I need your loving every day and night
You're kinda lovin' makes me feel alright



Baby don't go
Baby don' go, not now
Baby don't go
I need you by my side girl
Baby don't go
I love you so
I don't want to lose you
You know it took me a long time
T finally realize
That a good thing is hard to find
That's why I'm standing right here
With you today girl
I want to keep you
I've come to my senses
I don't wanna go anywhere
I'm coming home
