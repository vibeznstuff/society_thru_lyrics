I never thought I'd miss you half as much as I do
And I never thought I'd feel this way the way I feel about you
As soon as I wake up, any night, any day
I know that it's you I need to take the blues away

It must be love, love, love
It must be love, love, love
Nothing more nothing less love is the best

How can it be that we can say so much without words
Bless you and bless me baby, bless the bees and the birds
I've got to be near you, every night, every day
I couldn't be happy baby any other way

It must be love, love, love
It must be love, love, love
Nothing more nothing less love is the best

As soon as I wake up, every night, every day
I know that it's you I need to take the blues away

It must be love, love, love
It must be love, love, love
Nothing more nothing less love is the best

It must be love, love, love
It must be love, love, love
Nothing more nothing less love is the best
