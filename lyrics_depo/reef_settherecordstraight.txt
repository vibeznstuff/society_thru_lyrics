On the floor can you feel it? ya definitely
On the floor can you feel it? I've been in my bed all night
On da floor do you mean it? does it really matter
On da floor can you feel it? o I can

I need a time that's physical
The motions you have it
You are the one that I adore
And you can see I want it
Some people born to criticize
It just a song get on it
Do not forget your animal
So let it out
I've got a feeling
And set the record straight
Cause I'm singing
Just set the record straight
I've got a feeling
I'd set the record straight
Cause I'm singing
Just set the record straight

On the floor can you feel it? I've been smiling long
On the floor can you feel it? I've come a long long way from my home
On da floor do you mean it? I am sure I've put my foot in my mouth sometimes
On the floor can you feel it? I can feel all right

I need a time that's physical
The motions you have it
You are the one the I adore
And you can see I want it
Some people born to criticize
It's just a song get on it
Do not forget I'm animal
So let it out
I got a feeling
Just set the record straight
Cause I'm singing
I set the record straight
I got a feeling
Just set the record straight
Cause I'm singing
Just set the record straight

I'd open your mined
But you've got to find it
All I say to you
It no criticize
But you've got to minded
All good things to you
I'd open your mind
But you've got to find it
All I say to you

I've got a feeling
And set the record straight
Cause I'm singing
I'd set the record straight
I've got a feeling
And set the record straight
And I'm singing
I'd set the record straight
I'd set the record straight for you
