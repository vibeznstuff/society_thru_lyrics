I'm the type of guy who never settles down
Where pretty girls are, you'll know that I'm around
I kiss 'em and I love 'em 'cause to me they're all the same
I hug 'em and I squeeze 'em, they don't even know my name
They call me the Wanderer, yeah, Wanderer
I roam round and round and round and round

There's Flo on my left and there's Mary on my right
And Janie is the girl
that'll be with tonight
And when she asks me which one I love the best
I tear open my shirt and show
Rosie on my chest

'Cause I'm the Wanderer, yeah, Wanderer
I roam round and round and round and round

(Bridge)
Well, I roam from town to town
Live life without a care
I'm as happy as a clown
With my 2 fists of iron but I'm goin' nowhere

I'm the type of guy that likes to roam around
I'm never in one place;
I roam from town to town
And when I find myself a-fallin' for some girl
I hop right into that car of mine and drive around the world
'Cause I'm the Wanderer, yeah, Wanderer
I roam round and round and round and round
