I'm doing nothing;
'Cause then at least I'm doing nothing wrong.
And I'm gon' staying on my own,
And turn off my telephone,
If nothing's gained then nothing's won.

Yeah, you can tell them,
Yeah, you can say whatever;
I don't care, yeah.
And if you wanna play it cool,
Then I got news for you,
It's getting hotter, hotter in here...

So, when I speak, listen
This is my decision,
And you keep on missing out the words (oh, oh, oh)
So when I speak, listen,
'Cause you keep on pushing,
Like I need permission to be heard (oh, oh, oh)

I'm gonna lift it, lift it higher!
I'm gonna lift it, lift it higher!
So when I speak, listen,
This is my decision,
And you keep on missing out the words.

It's getting closer,
I'm movin' in and yeah I think you know,
'Cause I am sick of playing games,
And I'm not gon' say no names,
But you and I know who to blame.

Yeah, you can tell 'em
Yeah, you can go ahead and put it straight,
'Cause I am finishing myself,
And I do not need your help,
I'm gonna do this, do it right.

So, when I speak, listen
This is my decision,
And you keep on missing out the words (oh, oh, oh)
So when I speak, listen,
'Cause you keep on pushing,
Like I need permission to be heard (oh, oh, oh)

I'm gonna lift it, lift it higher!
I'm gonna lift it, lift it higher!
So when I speak, listen,
This is my decision,
And you keep on missing out the words.

I'm gonna lift it, lift it...
When you go higher, I go higher!
I'm gonna lift it, lift it...
Yeah, you can try, but I go higher!
I'm gonna lift it, lift it...
The only thing, boy, all that you can do is listen, so listen!

So, when I speak, listen
This is my decision (yeah, yeah!)
And you keep on missing out the words (oh, oh, oh) (You keep on missing out my words!)
So when I speak, listen,
'Cause you keep on pushing,
Like I need permission to be heard (oh, oh, oh)

I'm gonna lift it, lift it higher!
I'm gonna lift it, lift it higher!
So when I speak, listen,
This is my decision,
And you keep on missing out the words.
