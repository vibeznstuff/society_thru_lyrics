 You said that love was just a state of mind 
A puzzle made of pieces you can't find 
And for me you never really had the time 
I was blind. 

 And everything that you meant to me 
Is written in the pages of my history 
But it's over now as far as i can see 
Suddenly 

 Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong 
 And now i'm caught 
 And now, i'm caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you 
 And now i'm caught 
 And now, i'm caught in the middle 

 Moving on she brings me brighter days 
Thoughts of you are in my mind always 
Like a memory that i can't erase 
It's here to stay 

 Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong 
 And now i'm caught 
 And now, i'm caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you 
 And now i'm caught 
 And now, i'm caught in the middle 

 So different 
( it's so different) 
So easy 
( so easy) 
But i can't get over you 
( i can't get over you) 
So different 
( it's so different) 
So easy 
( so easy) 
But i can't get over you 
( and i can't get over you) 

 Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong 
 And now i'm caught 
 And now, i'm caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you 
 And now i'm caught 
 And now, i'm caught in the middle 

 Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong 
 And now i'm caught 
 And now, i'm caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you 
 And now i'm caught 
 And now, i'm caught in the middle 

 Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong 
And now i'm caught 
Caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you 
And now, i'm caught in the middle
