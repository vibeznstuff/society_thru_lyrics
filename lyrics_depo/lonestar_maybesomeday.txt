I never dreamed that it would end this way
Shattered pieces of my broken heart fill this empty room
I close my eyes and try to see your face
As I'm clinging to the fading trace of your perfume
Wish I could make myself believe
Everything that you told me

Someday someday
I would understand why you said goodbye
Someday someway
I can let you go and get on with my life
I'm waiting, waiting
To open up my eyes and feel alive
In a better place
It hasn't happened baby
Maybe someday

You told me it would take only a little time
And I'd get to where I wouldn't think about you anymore
And I should probably hate you for these tears of mine
Girl I tried, but I can't love you any less than I did before
There are days when I can barely breathe
Reliving everything you said to me

Someday someday
I would understand why you said goodbye
Someday someway
I can let you go and get on with my life
I'm waiting, waiting
To open up my eyes and feel alive
In a better place
It hasn't happened baby
Maybe someday
Oh yeah

Everywhere I look there's a part of you
Reminding me what could have been, what used to be
Will it ever end?
I'm not convinced

Someday someday
I would understand why you said goodbye
Someday someway
I can let you go and get on with my life
I'm waiting, waiting
To open up my eyes and feel alive
In a better place
It hasn't happened baby
Maybe...
Maybe someday, oh
Someday
