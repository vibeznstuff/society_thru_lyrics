Into each life some rain must fall
I didn't know I would catch it all
The clear skies have gone
And you with them too
It's not the same now without you
I used to say you're so beautiful
But it didn't change a thing at all
There's nowhere to run
Got nowhere to hide
I can't forget you and I've tried, but...

I'm a deeper shade of blue
And there's nothing I can do
You're so far, far away
Yeah, I'm a darker shade of me
And I just can't be free
You're so far, far away
You're so far away

Into each life some sun must shine
Well someone else must be getting mine
The days are so empty
Night's are so long
Awaking to find again that you've gone
I used to say you were wonderful
Now I just wonder where you are
It's easy to say memories fade
But I'm still missing you
Nothing's changed ... and

I'm a deeper shade of blue
And there's nothing I can do
You're so far, far away
Yeah, I'm a darker shade of me
And I just can't be free
You're so far, far away
You're so far away

Summer is over
And all we are is apart
The nights are so cold now
Without you in my heart

I'm a deeper shade of blue
And there's nothing I can do
You're so far, far away
Yeah, I'm a darker shade of me
And I just can't be free
You're so far, far away
You're so far away
