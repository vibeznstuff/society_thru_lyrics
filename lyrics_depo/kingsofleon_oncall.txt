She said call me now baby, and I'd come a running. 
She said call me now baby, and I'd come a running. 
If you'd call me now, baby then I'd come a running. 

I'm on call, to be there. 
One and all, to be there. 
And When I fall, to pieces. 
Lord you know, I'll be there waiting. 

To be there. 
To be there. 

I'm on call, to be there. 
One and all, to be there. 
And When I fall, to pieces. 
Lord you know, I'll be there waiting. 

I'm gon' brawl, so be there. 
One for all, I'll be there. 
And when they fall, to pieces. 
Lord you know, I'll be there laughing. 

I'd come a running. 
I'd come a running. 
I'd come a running. 

To be there. 
To be there. 

I'm on call, to be there. 
I'm on call, to be there. 
I'm on call, to be there. 
I'm on call, to be there.
