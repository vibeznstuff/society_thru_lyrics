Well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
That'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day, when I die

You gave me all your loving
And all your turtle-dovin'
All your hugs and your money too,
You know you love me baby
Still you tell me maybe
That someday well, I'll be blue

That'll be the day, when you say goodbye
That'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave - you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die

When Cupid shot his dart
He shot it at your heart
So if we ever part, well I'll leave you
You sit and hold me
You tell me boldly
That someday well, I'll be blue

That'll be the day, when you say goodbye
That'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave - you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die
