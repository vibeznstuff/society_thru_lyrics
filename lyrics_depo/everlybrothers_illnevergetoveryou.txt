I'll never get over you
No matter how I try
I'll never get over you
Baby unless I die

I live my life to the fullest
I take my love where it lies
I hold the girls they enjoy it
But I always kiss them goodbye

I'll never get over you
No matter how I try
I'll never get over you
Baby unless I die

At night I'm never lonely
I laugh and drink sweet wine
In the morning I wake up smiling
A young man in his prime

I'll never get over you
No matter how I try
I'll never get over you
Baby unless I die

I may live to be a hundred
A long and happy life
But there's one thing you can bet on
I'll never have a wife

I'll never get over you
No matter how I try
I'll never get over you
Baby unless I die
I'll never get over you
No matter how I try
I'll never get over you...
