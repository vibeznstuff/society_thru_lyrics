It's easy to fall in love
When you fall in love you know you're done
You got easy eyes to hunt
And the world above needs your blood
In the cold veins of the richest man
He'll pay your way to steal her hand

There ain't no easy way
No there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way
No there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way
No there ain't no easy way out

It's easy to fall in love
When you've run your luck you know you're done
And the last kiss had fool's cost
Now your tired eyes can only haunt

There ain't no easy way
No there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way
No there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way
No there ain't no easy way out

There ain't no easy way
No there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way
No there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way
No there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way
No there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way
No there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way
No there ain't no easy way out

It's easy to fall in love
When you fall in love you know you're done
It's easy to fall in love
When you fall in love you know you're done
