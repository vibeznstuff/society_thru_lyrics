Thinking of you, thinking of me
Thinking of you, thinking of me
Yes it pains me to say your gone, but I guess it's what I've best done
Everything I did was wrong , now there's tears in all my songs
But I love you and you know it's true, even though I couldn't keep my cool
And it's killing me to face each day, Dear God help me I pray

Trippin, I been trippin'
Trippin, thinking of you
Trippin, can't stop trippin'
Thinking of you, thinking of me

Haven't heard from you in so long, wonder how she is getting on
Is he treating you better than me, Yes I'm happy but I feel empty
Cause you know that I love you bad, All the things he got I had
But what makes me feel so sad, you have the child we always planned

Trippin, I been trippin'
Trippin, thinking of you
Trippin, can't stop trippin'
Thinking of you, thinking of me

Trippin, I been trippin'
Trippin, when I'm thinking of you
Trippin, always trippin
Thinking of you, thinking of me

I've been trippin, I've been trippin, I've been trippin
I've been trippin, I've been trippin, I've been trippin

Trippin, I'm just crying on my own
Trippin, Mark your sittin all alone
Trippin, Yes I'm crying baby
I'm just trippin lady
Thinking of you, thinking of me
Listen break it down......

Trippin, ohhhhhhhh
Trippin,ohhhhhhhhh
Trippin, ohhhhhhhhhhh
Thinking of you, thinking of me
Yeah, yeah.....

Trippin, ohhhhhhhh
Trippin,ohhhhhhhhh
Trippin, ohhhhhhhhhhh
Thinking of you, thinking of me

It's all because of you, I'm feeling sad and blue
Cos you went away you went away
