When I'm walking down the street I call your name
Inside my head I go insane
Don't you know that it's really making me crazy
There were days when I went completely blind
No time to think and I lost time
Won't believe what's happened to me lately

Cos everyday it's the same day
Different faces with no names
Places I've never been before
And everyday it's the same thing
Different faces with no names
Places I've never been before

And I begin to wonder (don't you know that it's really making me crazy)
And I begin to wonder (won't believe what's happened to me lately)

Cos everyday it's the same day
Different faces with no names
Places I've never been before
And everyday it's the same thing
Different faces with no names
Places I've never been before

And every time I think I'm breaking free
These thoughts return to trouble me
Hanging on to love has left me empty
You're a sinner but you told me you're a saint
Too fast I tripped and lost my way
Can't believe what's happened to me lately

Walking down the street I call your name
(All this time you led me astray)
Making love to you I do the same
(But now I know you blinded me)
And there were days when I went completely blind
(I thought I was over you, really over you)
No time to think, I lost time
(no, I'm not over you)

And I, begin to wonder
