You won't see me crying, crying over you
And you don't see me falling, even baby when I'm falling for two
Sometimes it's hard to see you're not approaching me when I watch you too
And don't you know I'm dying just to spend a little more time with you

Baby, I'm yours, all of the time
And I know that you'll never see

I'm thinking 'bout you
(Thinking 'bout you)
Want to give you all my love
When I'm thinking 'bout you
(Thinking 'bout you)
Just can't give you up, I
I don't want to sleep, I don't want to leave, I don't want a way out
I just want to feel every little bit when I'm thinking 'bout you
(Thinking 'bout you)
Thinking 'bout you

I only wanna give you love
I only wanna sing your songs
I don't wanna give this up
I don't wanna left you down

Baby, I'm yours, all the time, all the time
I know that you'll never see

I'm thinking 'bout you
(Thinking 'bout you)
Want to give you all my love
When I'm thinking 'bout you
(Thinking 'bout you)
Just can't give you up, I
I don't want to sleep, I don't want to leave, I don't want a way out
I just want to feel every little bit when I'm thinking 'bout you
(Thinking 'bout you)
Thinking 'bout you

Maybe I get lost sometime
You're the only thing on my mind
And baby, you don't see

When I'm thinking 'bout you
(Thinking 'bout you)
Want to give you all my love
When I'm thinking 'bout you
(Thinking 'bout you)
Just can't give you up, 'cause
I don't want to sleep, I don't want to leave, I don't want a way out
I just want to feel every little bit when I'm thinking 'bout you
(Thinking 'bout you)
Thinking 'bout you
