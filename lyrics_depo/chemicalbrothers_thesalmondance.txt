Hello boys and girls, my name is FatLip,
And this is my friend Sammy the Salmon.
What 'do?
Today, we're going to teach you some fun new facts about salmon,
And a brand new dance.

Let me introduce to you a brand new dance,
I know you're gonna love it if you give it one chance.
It's not complicated, it's not too hard,
You don't even have to be a hip hop star.
See anyone can do it, all you need is style,
Listen up peep gang, I'ma show you how:
Put your hands to the side, as silly as it seems,
And shake your body like a salmon floatin' up stream!

I'll float up stream
You know how we do it, you know how we do it
Again.

All my peeps spend part of their life in fresh water
And part of their life in salt water
Wow, very interesting.
We change round a couple of days after spawning
Then we die

When I first did the Salmon, all the people just laughed.
They looked around and stood like I was on crack.
I heard somebody say out loud "what the fuck is that?"
"This nigga's dancin like a fish while he's doin' the snap"
But the more I kept doing it the more they were feelin' it,
And then I heard some bitches say "yo that niggas killin' it".
By the end of the night, everyone was on my team,
And the whole club was dancing like a salmon floatin' up stream!

I'll float up stream
You know how we do it, you know how we do it
Again.

Most of our friends find their home waters by sense of smell
Which is even more keen than that of a dog or a bear
Wow
My family also rely on ocean currents, tides
The gravitational pull of the moon
I'm floatin' upstream again
The moon? Fish pay attention to the moon? Wow. Who knew?
Did you know?
What?
That I could go to Japan, and back.
You're kidding me. Amazing. Jeez.
Polluted water can kill both baby salmon, that are developing
And the adult salmon, that are on their way to spawn
Wow what a shame, what a shame
Huh?
Woah
Wow. Hey s-kids, hey give it up for s-Sammy the Salmon and his amazing salmon dance
Huh? Whadda ya say? Alright
Who's hungry?
