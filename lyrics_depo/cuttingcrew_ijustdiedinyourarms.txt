Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way
To get out of this

Her diary sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cat's in her cradle
Who would've thought
That a boy like me could come to this?

Oh-oh-oh, whoa
Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh-oh-oh, whoa

Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away

Is there any just cause for feeling like this?
On the surface, I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet
But then blow it again

I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy
One too many times

Oh-oh-oh, whoa
Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away

It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over, the moment is gone
I followed my hands, not my head
I know I was wrong

Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away
