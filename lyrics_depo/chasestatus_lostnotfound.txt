Blinded by the lights, this movie ain’t over
Take me by the hand, you feel a little colder
I’m never gonna let you go
I’m never gonna let you down
The heart has taken control
There’s no one around


We’re fading away
Getting high off the ground
We’re fading away
Lost and not found
We’re fading away
Getting high off the ground
we’re fading away
Lost and not found


We gonna take the flight
Paper planes, getting rolled up
Our dreams hit the fan
The pain of getting older

I’m never gonna let you go
I’m never gonna let you down
The heart has taken control
There’s no one around


We’re fading away
Getting high off the ground
We’re fading away
Lost and not found
We’re fading away
Getting high off the ground
We’re fading away
Lost and not found

I’m never gonna let you go
I’m never gonna let you down
The heart has taken control
There’s no one around
There’s no one around
There’s no one around
There’s no one around

There’s no one around
There’s no one around
There’s no one around
There’s no one around


We’re fading away
Getting high off the ground
We’re fading away
Lost and not found
We’re fading away
Getting high off the ground
We’re fading away
Lost and not found
