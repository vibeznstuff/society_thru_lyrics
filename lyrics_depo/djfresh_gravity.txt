All hands on the trigger
All eyes on the gun
They don't believe that we are
Strong enough to hold on
'Cause I'm the only one to get you
The only one to figure you out
You're a place that I can go to
A face I couldn't live without
And nobody sees what we do
Don't need anybody else around

No matter what they told us
Gravity won't hold us down

Even gravity can't hold us
Even gravity can't hold us down
Even gravity can't hold us
Not even gravity can hold us down

'Cause I'm the only one to get you
The only one to figure you out
You're a place that I can go to
A face I couldn't live without
And nobody sees what we do
Don't need anybody else around
Cause no matter what they told us
Gravity can't hold us down

Can't understand the logic of how we came to be
Or what we gaining from it
That we should dare to dream

'Cause I'm the only one to get you
The only one to figure you out
And there's nothing left to go through
Just look at where we are right now
They'll never see it in the way we do
'Cause they'll never have what we have found
It don't matter what they told us
Gravity won't hold us down

Even gravity can't hold us
Even gravity can't hold us down
Even gravity can't hold us
Even gravity won't hold us down
Gravity, gravity
And even gravity, gravity
Gravity, gravity
No, gravity, can't hold us down
Gravity, gravity
Not even gravity, gravity
Gravity can't hold us
Even gravity can't hold us down
Can't hold us down
Can't hold us down
