You don't believe me
I can tell it by your eyes

There's a kind of magic to be had from your lies.
I used to say that today is like tomorrow

Don't sell it short for truth.
I should have known
I should have known
Should have known how

I should have known
I should have known by now
But now
Everything is coming up roses
Everything is coming up roses.

You don't understand it
I can tell it by your smile

There's a kind of freedom to be had from your lies.
I always said that today is like tomorrow

Don't sell it short for truth.

I should have known
I should have known
Should have known how

Everything is coming up roses
Everything is coming up
Coming up

Everything is coming up roses.

Everything is coming up roses
Everything is coming up roses

Everything is coming up roses
Everything is coming up
Coming up

Everything is coming up roses.
