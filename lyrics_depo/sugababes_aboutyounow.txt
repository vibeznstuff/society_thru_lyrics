It was so easy that night,
Should have been strong, yeah I lied,
Nobody gets me like you,

I know everything changes,
All the cities and faces,
But I know how I feel about you,

Can we bring yesterday back around,
'Cus I know how I feel about you now,
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down,
But I know how I feel about you now

All that it takes one more chance,
Don't let our last kiss be our last,
Give me tonight and I'll show you

I know everything changes,
I don't care where it takes us,
'Cus I know how I feel about you

Can we bring yesterday back around,
'Cus I know how I feel about you now,
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down,
But I know how I feel about you now

Not a day pass me by,
Not a day pass me by,
When I don't think about you,
And there's no moving on,
'Cus I know your the one,
And I can't be without you

Can we bring yesterday back around,
'Cus I know how I feel about you now,
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down,
But I know how I feel about you now

Can we bring yesterday back around,
'Cus I know how I feel about you now,
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down,
But I know how I feel about you now

But I know how I feel about you now

Yes I know how I feel about you now
