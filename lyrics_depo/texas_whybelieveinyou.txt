You're the type of person that I need to meet
And I want to learn from you
I need this now do I ask too much
To be close to you
I want you
And your love
I want everything

Oh I believe in love
So why believe in you

Some people are just living to be hurt
So I want to run to you
And I feel your warmth, but you're cold to touch
when I'm close to you
I see you
you've been hurt
now I see everything

Oh I believe in love
So why believe in you
You make me want to shout
You make me want to cry
So why believe in you

I want you
And your love
I want everything

Oh I believe in you
So why believe in you
You make me want to shout
You make me want to cry
So why believe in you
