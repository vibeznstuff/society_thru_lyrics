There's no way back from here
On out
Only one place left to go
One place left to go
Now

She's crashing like an airplane
From the sky from the storming rain
Another pilot she's a flying eight
Hit her target a kamikaze go up in flames

This life is taught she must pay
Pay the price for her mistakes
I guess she only has herself to blame
And to her that's the deepest shame

There's no way back from here
On out
Only one place left to go
One place left to go
Now
She was once a princess
But now she's a mess
A fiend for a fix like the rest
Eliciting sex and pocket less
But she was a sweet thing nevertheless
Back in the day abused as a child
She was always likely to end up this way
The past lived in the dark parts of the brain
And only heroin seemed to take away the pain
So she folded the foil and lit the flame
Inhale exhale out once again she's on the game
They all know her face and the standard going rate
Just not her name with only herself to blame
She lives this hell
But there's a millions other girls just like Michelle
Out in the streets with nothing else to sell
To these desperate males other than themselves so

There's no way back from here
On out
Only one place left to go
One place left to go
Now

There's no way back from here
On out
Only one place left to go
One place left to go
Now

I been walking alone this dirty road
Been so long now I just can't tell
If there's any way back the way I came
Though I've lost my path is the deepest shame

I been dragging myself to the lowest of low
There's such a way I just don't know
If the path I take is something I can change
Well if it's in my way is the deepest shame

There's no way back from here
On out
Only one place left to go
One place left to go
Now

There's no way back from here
On out
Only one place left to go
One place left to go
Now

There's no way back from here
On out
Only one place left to go
One place left to go
Now
