First day that I saw you, thought you were beautiful
But I couldn't talk to you, I watched you walk away
And it felt like I spent all of that second day
Trying to figure out what it was that I should have said

Third day, saw you again, introduced by a friend
Said all the words I wanted to
On day four and five and six, I don't know what you did
But all I could think about was you

Thought I couldn't want you more than I did before
But every day I love you a little bit more
Find myself asking, what are you waiting for?
'cause every day I love you a little bit more

Days, they turned into weeks
That's how good this has been
Said I can't believe the way this first year has gone

Still, you catch me by surprise when I look in your eyes
When you turn and say that you love me

Thought I couldn't want you more than I did before
But every day I love you a little bit more
Find myself asking, what are you waiting for?
'cause every day I love you a little bit more

(and more)
I love you more (and more)
I love you more (and more)
I love you more

Day one, I first laid my eyes on you
Day two, I can't help but think of you
Day three was the same as day two
Day four, I fell in love with you

Day five, you spent it with me
Sixth day, knocked me off my feet
Day seven, that's when I knew
I'd spend the rest of my life with you

Thought I couldn't want you more than I did before
But every day I love you a little bit more
Find myself asking, what are you waiting for?
'cause every day I love you a little bit more

Every day, knowing I'm gonna see your face
And that's enough for me
I want you more and more and more every day

(and more) I'm gonna spend my life with you
(and more) every day, there's something new
(and more) and love you more and more and more every day

(and more)
And I love you more (and more)
I love you more (and more)
I love you more
