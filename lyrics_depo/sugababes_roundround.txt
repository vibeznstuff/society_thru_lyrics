Round, round baby
Round, round
Spinning out on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free
We'll ride still fired on the beat down low
I don't need nobody but my honeys
When I go round, baby round round
Spinning out on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free
(Free free free free)

When your stare in my face
You're messing with my brain
If you're trying to convince me
Then you better think again
If you move to the music
The music's got to give
If it's too complicated
That's the way I want to live

If you hate me
I will show you
How to break me
Into something new
If you want me
Run away now
If you stop me
Then I'll hit the ground
(Can we go, here we go)

Round, round baby
Round, round
Spinning out on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free
We'll ride still fired on the beat down low
I don't need nobody but my honeys
When I go

Explainations - no you don't need one
Having a good time
Getting down to the fun
And it's your time
Just tonight he'll be mine
And he's gone
Yeah

People moving, bodies grooving
Never ending
Players are changing
(Don't you worry 'bout a thing all you need is off your sting)
All my girls are here with me
Worry now they've got their need
(Do you feel me, do you feel me, do you feel me, do you feel me)
Woo

Round, round baby round, round
Spinning out on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free
We'll ride still fired on the beat down low
I don't need nobody but my honeys
When I go round baby round round
Spinning out on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free
We'll ride still fired on the beat down low
I don't need nobody but my honeys
When I go

Ooh
Does it hurt, when you see
How I've done
Without you
Thought that I couldn't belong
Never thought that you could be so cruel
All you need is some friends
Won't be by yourself
Let's go round and round and round and round and r-o-u-nd

Round, round baby round, round
Spinning out on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free
We'll ride still fired on the beat down low
I don't need nobody but my honeys
When I go round baby round round
Spinning out on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free
We'll ride still fired on the beat down low
I don't need nobody but my honeys
When I go

Round, baby when I go
When I go
(When I go)
When I go
(When I go)
When I go
When I go round baby
(When I go)
When I go
(When I go)
When I go
(When I go)
When I go
When I go
