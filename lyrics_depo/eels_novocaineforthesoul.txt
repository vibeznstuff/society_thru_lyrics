Life is hard
And so am i
You'd better give me something
So i don't die 

Novocaine for the soul
Before i sputter out 

Life is white
And i am black
Jesus and his lawyer
Are coming back
Oh my darling
Will you be here
Before i sputter out 

Guess whose living here
With the great undead
This paint-by-numbers life
Is fucking with my head 
Once again 

Life is good
And i feel great
'cause mother says i was
A great mistake 

Novocaine for the soul
You'd better give me something
To fill the hole
Before i sputter out
