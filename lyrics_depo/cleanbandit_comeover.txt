I never said any of this was gonna be simple
But sometimes all it takes is just a symbol, ooh oh
Because the place you want to reach is right in front of you
You're getting stronger
So just keep on that bit longer
Ra pa pum

Girl come over
Mi want you closer
Tired of the rainy days
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sunshine
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sunshine

So before the night over
I want you to know that
I'm willing to change my ways
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sunshine
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sunshine

Come over, come over
Come over, come, come over
Come over, come over
Come over, come, come over

I guess you're gonna run out luck love sooner or later
You better make time to sit down and put pen to paper
Because the things you want to do will slip away from you
It won't be long now
So just keep on being strong now
