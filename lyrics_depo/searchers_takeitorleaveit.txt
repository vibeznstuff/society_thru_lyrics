You can turn off and on more times
Than a flashin' neon sign
When you want, you're bad
But you can be so kind

Just take it or leave it
Don't tell your friend
Just want you're gonna do now
You take it or you leave it, it's just my life

There've been times when you tried makin' eyes
At all my so called friends
Then you go, now you're back
But you can be so kind

Just take it or leave it
Don't tell your friend
Just what you're gonna do now
You take it or you leave it, it's just my life

I'm sick and tired of the smile that you give
When you don't come home at night
Said you'd call that's a lie
But you can be so kind

Just take it or leave it
Don't tell your friend
Just what you're gonna do now
You take it or you leave it, it's just my life
