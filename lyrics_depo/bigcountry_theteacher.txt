We talked and smoked all through the night 
You led me where I had no sight
Till birdsong broke the morning light
And I was weak with strange delight

Teacher will you show to me
The bond between the land and sea
For I am new to mystery I want everything laid out for me
All of history
All of history

You showed me walls around the world
Where seekers passed and flags unfurled
You wove a tale in silken curls
And blew the mist in silver swirls

Teacher will you show to me
The bond between the land and sea
For I am new to mystery I want everything laid out for me
All of history
All of history

Teacher will you show to me
The bond between the land and sea
For I am new to mystery
I want everything laid out for me
All of history
All of history
All of history
All of history
