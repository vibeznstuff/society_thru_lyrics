I bet you love me more after that first fuck
I bet you love me more after you hear Worst Luck
I bet you love me more when I write you these songs
I bet you love me when I finally make it home, yeah

I'm a make it mine, mine for the night
Got me pulling on your hair
I'm a make it mine, mine for the night
Got me pulling on your hair


I bet you love me more after that first fuck
I bet you love me more after you get that first nut
I bet you love more when I write you these songs
I bet you love me when I finally make it home


I'm a make you mine, mine
Got you pulling on my hair
I'm a make you mine, mine
(Got me pulling on your hair)

I bet you love me more after the first fuck
I bet I love you better than your first love
I bet I love you so much you forget the shit that had you worked up, yeah
I bet I love you more than I can say to you
Something 'bout you makes me wanna lay with you
But only for the night


(I'm a make you mine, mine)
Got me pulling on your hair
I'm a make it mine, mine for the night
Got me pulling on your hair


I bet you love me more, I bet you love me more
I bet you love me more
I bet you love me more after that first fuck
I bet you love me more
