He sits alone at a table in a small cafe 
Drowning his tears in a bottomless cup of coffee 
And hes tumbling into his thoughts 
His memories are all tied in knots 
And who is going to save him 
No one wants to know him 

She stands alone in a place where no one knows her name 
She catches them staring they turn around and vanish the frame 
And shes nursing her head and her pride 
She died long ago deep down inside 
And who is going to save her 
No one wants to know her 


I cant believe that youd pull on a sleeve when you cry 
You stick in the knife then give the kiss of life 
Live the lie 
And we all have a saviour 
So do yourself a favour 
Stop livin the lie 

He sits alone and looks up to the eyes of an angel 
She catches him staring and smiles the smile of an angel 
And she asks him if this chair is free 
He said yes will you sit here with me 
No one would have saved him 
We should all learn from them 


Lie.... lie.... stop livin the lie
