If I fall, can you pull me up?
Is it true, your watching out
And when I'm tired, do you lay down with me?
In my head so I can sleep without you?

Hey, hey
Without you there's holes in my soul
Hey, hey
Let the water in

Where ever you've gone?
How, how, how?
I just need to know
That you won't forget about me
Where ever you've gone?
How, how, how?
I just need to know
That you won't forget about me

Lost through time and that's all I need
So much love, then one day buried
Hope you're safe, cause I lay you leaves
Is there more than we can see?
Answers for me

And hey, hey
Without you there's holes in my soles
Hey, hey
Let the water in

Where ever you've gone?
How, how, how?
I just need to know
That you won't forget about me
Where ever you've gone?
How, how, how?
I just need to know
That you won't forget about me

And I get lonely without you
And I can't move on
And I get lonely without you
I can't move on
Move on

Where ever you've gone?
How, how, how?
I just need to know
That you won't forget about me
How, how, how?
