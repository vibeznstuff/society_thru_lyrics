I'm sitting here waiting for my lover 
Last time we met I wasn't to sure 
Now I'm hoping, maybe dreaming, for a life as one 
When she reads this I'm hoping she'll call 
But I need much more than before 
I need positive reactions whenever I'm down 

Cause I'm sure so sure 
That it's heaven knocking on my door 
Sure so sure so baby come on inside 
Need you so much more and more each time we touch 
Sure so sure that it's sweet love I found 

It isn't a game so don't play hard to get 
(Tired of running after you) 
There's no connections holding us down (down) 
Isn't it a shame it never happened 
though still here we are the second time round 
It's gotta be social, compatible, sexual, irresistible 
It's gotta be right for love 

Sure so sure 
That it's heaven knocking on my door 
Sure so sure so baby come on inside 
Need you so much more and more each time we touch 
Sure so sure that it's sweet love I found 

Holdin', squeezin', touchin', teasin' 
Wantin', wishin', waitin', teasin' 
Of you love, yeah yeah 
Blindin', groovin', feel it, move it 
Findin', breathin', bracin', breedin' 
With you girl 
It's gotta be social, compatible, sexual, irresistible 
It's gotta be right for love 

Cause I'm sure so sure 
That it's heaven knocking on my door 
Sure so sure so baby come on inside 
Need you so much more and more each time we touch 
Sure so sure that it's sweet love I found
