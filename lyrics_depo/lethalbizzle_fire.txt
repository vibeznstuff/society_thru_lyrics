Yeah! Yeah!
Da Bizzle!
(Woooo)
Da Bizzle!
(Woooo)
Da Bizzle!
(Woooo)
Da Bizzle!
(Let's Go)
It's a shame
Before the fire's gonna do the beat
It's a shame
Cuz we're (back now)
It's a shame
Before the fire's gonna do the beat
It's a shame
Cuz we're (here now)
Yo! Yo!
You thought more fire crew was really gonna roll
More fire roll while they wonders no!
Universal got me feelin' a little bit o' low
Made a little dough then they kicked us out the door'
Fire hater what you laughing for'?
Your skinny ass won't fit through the door
Go round you were sayin' ain't no more no!
Shutup! they won't know shutup! they won't know
So
More fire crew pioneers in the scene
Why you tryin' to bust the gangsta scene
Now everybody tryna rechoose me
The only crew through thick n thin is still a team
I know your wondering now where did we go
One stage wasn't confident to do a show
But I let you know that we're never gonna go
And I wanna let you haters know that...
It's a shame
Before the fire's gonna do the beat
It's a shame
Cuz we're (back now)
It's a shame
Before the fire's gonna do the beat
It's a shame
Cuz we're (here now)
Yo! Yo!
We didn't mean to go but now we are back
Compare us to the artists coming through and they are crap
I don't mean to have a big head but it's a fact
Making sure that I'll make you move that is whack
Now I'm showing you a side that you really don't know
Leth of the Bizzle yeah full of a lot of soul
With the new style wonder how far I 'go
I'm not gonna stop I'm gonna keep on going
But, I know how ya probably feelin'
I know ya probably screamin'
I know ya pulling ya hair punching fists right on the ceiling
So such a happy feelin'
So such a last to Meanin'
 right through the ceiling
You don't know how I feel
The feeling it be real
So saying I think I will
I want to make a meal
So I think you should chill
Yknow we know the deal
Ya too late anyway ya hearts not there
It's a shame
Before the fire's gonna do the beat
It's a shame
Cuz we're (back now)
It's a shame
Before the fire's gonna do the beat
It's a shame
Cuz we're (here now)
La La La Lala
La La La La La La Lala
(Yeah)
First and foremost
I wanna bigup the fans
That stuck with the Fire through thick 'n thin
Right about now it's the takeover
The Bizzle
Alright then
Let's go
It's a shame
Before the fire's gonna do the beat
It's a shame
Cuz we're (back now)
It's a shame
Before the fire's gonna do the beat
It's a shame
Cuz we're (here now)
La La La Lala
La La La La La La Lala...
