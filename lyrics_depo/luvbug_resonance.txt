If you really cared you would care less
Fight the fear of being fearless, fearless

Done with the norm, we want enormous
Blood on the floor but it was flawless, flawless
Resonance
Running through my veins
Resonance
Running through my brain

I need this resonance
Like a club needs bass

If you really cared you would care less
Fight the fear of being fearless, fearless

Done with the norm, we want enormous
Blood on the floor but it was flawless, flawless

Resonance
Running through my veins
Resonance
Running through my brain

I need this resonance
Like a club needs bass

Resonance
Running through my veins
Resonance
Running through my brain

I need this resonance
Like a club needs bass

I need this resonance
Like a club needs bass
