True Romance, 
Is what I'm after darling, 
As it stands, 
In the shoe that's cruising
Crawling through like midnight panthers, 
Growling at the moon, 

I'm on higher ground, 
Your the last of your kind, 
All in good time you'll find, 
That I'm the first of mine, 
My kind, my kind, 
Yeah I'm the first of mine, 
My kind, my kind, 
Sub-zero
I know your as cold as ice, 
Kiss gives me frost bite, 
It seems like you can't get enough, 
I'm on higher ground, 
Your the last of your kind, 
All in good time you'll find, 
That I'm the first of mine, 
My kind, my kind, 
Yeah I'm the first of mine, 
My kind, my kind, 

Those exploding roads
Tinted specticles
In the back of my mind, 
Chinese whispers floating round
Heaven rows, 
I'm the first of my kind, 

I'm on higher ground, 
Your the last of your kind, 
All in good time you'll find, 
That I'm the first of mine.
My kind, my kind, 
Yeah I'm the first of mine, 
My kind, my kind, 
Yeah I'm the first of mine, 
My kind, my kind, 
My kind, my kind, 
My kind yeah
