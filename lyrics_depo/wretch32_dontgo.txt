Don't go 

I don't know where you come from, 
But you're everywhere I go. 
I don't know why you chose me (why me?) 
But as long as your here, I don't need to know. 

So don't go 

Yeah, when I got introduced to you, 
I knew I'd be true to you, 
Everyone wanted a piece, you whispered to me sweet guys like me you love. 
And I feel it in my soul, 
It's like you're always with me on the road. 
Phone in my hand while I listen to you moan, 
And everybody in the car wants to try and get involved, 
Yeah, then you make a silly tone, 
Puppy love now, like give a dog a bone, 
Shut me how I can breathe when I'm a frown 
Our loves concrete 
We should lead a setting stone 

Yeah and when ever I'm in doubt, 
You forever calm me down 
And sometimes I'm a dummy and I know I would of crashed if you never was around 

So don't go, 
Don't leave, 
Please stay, 
With me, 
You are, the only thing, I need to get by, 
Get by. 

Yeah I spend a little change on you, 
But you always give it back. 
Cos' I know you ain't here for the money, 
You just wanna see me be the man 
So I earnt my respect like a true gentleman, 
All rumours where capital E relevant. 
We should get three two emblems, 
i give my life to you that's a street settlement. 

Yeah, I'm feeling ever so emotional, 
Cos I never had nothing when approaching you, 
Sitting with a straight face on a poker man, 
That's why a song like this has been over due, 
Due over time, 
Time over, 

Love drunk you and I would die sober. 
I'm in this for forever and a day 
That's why wherever I go, they've got to put you on a plane 

So don't go, 
Don't leave, 
Please Stay, 
With me, 
You are the only thing I need, to get by 
To get by 

See I swear, I ain't ever seen a sky so clear, 
Together were gonna make history, 
Why would you wanna be elsewhere? 
See I swear, I ain't ever seen a sky so clear, 
Together were gonna make history, 
Why would you wanna be else where? 

Don't go leave me now, 
Don't go leave me. 
Stay right here till my darks day in to light years Imma shine. 
Don't go leave me now, 
Don't go leave me. 
Loosing you is one of my fears, 
But I ain't selfish I shear, if I have to. 

So don't go, 
Don't leave, 
Please stay, 
With me, 
You are the only thing I need, to get by 
To get by. 

So don't go, 
don't leave, 
Please stay, 
With me, 
You are the only thing I need, to get by 
To only get by.
