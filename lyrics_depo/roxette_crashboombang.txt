My Papa told me to stay out of trouble
"When you've found your man, make sure he's for real!". 

I've learned that nothing really lasts forever
I sleep with the scars I wear that won't heal
They won't heal. 

Cos every time I seem to fall in love
Crash! Boom! Bang!
I find the heart but then I hit the wall
Crash! Boom! Bang!
That's the call, that's the game and the pain stays the same. 

I'm walking down this empty road to nowhere
I pass by the houses and blocks I once knew. 

My Mama told me not to mess with sorrow
But I always did, and Lord, I still do
I'm still breaking the rules 
I kick it up
I kick it down. 

Cos every time I seem to fall in love
Crash! Boom! Bang!
I find the heart but then I hit the wall
Crash! Boom! Bang!
That's my real middle-name
It has always been the same
That's the call, that's the game and the pain stays the same. 

I still feel the heat
Slowly fallin' from the sky 
And the taste of the kissing
Shattered by rain
Comin' tumblin' from behind
And the wild holy war. 

I kick it up
I kick it down

And every time I seem to fall in love
Crash! Boom! Bang!
I find the roses dying on the floor
Crash! Boom! Bang!
That's the tall, that's the game and the pain stays the same
That's my real middle-name
It has always been the same. 

Oh Yea Oh Yea Oh Yea Uh-huh
Been the same, been the same
It has always been the same.
