They sayin’ don’t sell out
Don’t sell out

(Kala sa kala sala
Kalasala kala sala
Kalasa la kalasala)

Let’s get!


I’m bout it, you know it
Disturb the line then pour it
Sparklers as in my Moet
If you need the glass and I pour it
Fashion week front row it
Chelsea and Soho it
Better valet park my …
Then the Council come and tow it
Rebel Vodka, JD and coke
Bitch turn up the radio
Heartless press pay as you go
Mixed with a little KC’ and Jo
Now my sex is crazy yo’
We don’t want the ratio
Tryin to get fellatio
From girls as fresh as Daisy Lowe
Them girls say Hi, Them girls say Hello
I tell ‘em stick your number in an envelope
She take it off but leave on her stilettos
You know you can find me riding white girls like a fellow
We say to ‘em


All you’re mad you ain’t us
Hold up when I’m famous, party like in Vegas
Yeah that alcohol made us
I tell em, tell em don’t sell out, tell em, tell em and don’t sell out
Tell em, tell em and don’t sell out, tell em and don’t sell out


Yeah!
Tatatata Tiger Beer or Cobra, lime in my Corona?
Chase down my bilateral periodical haematoma
Livin la vida loca, I be from Barcelona
Life throws me lemons, now Celebrity Juice on my sofa
Got girl in Oklahoma, and the LA girl that do yoga
A girl in Amsterdam that’s a stoner
And a sexy female chauffeur
And a girl that makes a racket
I call her Anna Kournakova
In and out the tax bracket
So much for my diploma
Say what’s up? And say what’s happening
He’ll be in the club just racks on racks on racks in
Was using words but no were using actions
Been around the world, and ladies love me and my London accent
We be sayin to em


All you’re mad you ain’t us
Hold up when I’m famous, party like in Vegas
Yeah that alcohol made us
I tell em, tell em don’t sell out, tell em, tell em and don’t sell out
Tell em, tell em and don’t sell out, tell em and don’t sell out


Am I drunk? No, am I lean? yes
I’ll do the roar, no, I’m clean, yes
I’ll do the tour, and shout
Bring out to me, yes
Roses could bore, no
And sedeem, yes
Am I mature? no
Should I be, yes
Are my jeans still saggy like the queen?
And i wear a lot of gold around my V
And i sell out all my shows just like they’re free
We keep on saying to them


All you’re mad you ain’t us
Hold up when I’m famous, party like in Vegas
Yeah that alcohol made us
I tell em, tell em don’t sell out, tell em, tell em and don’t sell out
Tell em, tell em and don’t sell out, tell em and don’t sell out
