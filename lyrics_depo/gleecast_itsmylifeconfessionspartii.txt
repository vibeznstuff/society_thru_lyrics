This ain't a song for the broken hearted 
No silent prayer for the faith departed 
And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd 
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out aloud 


It's my life! 


It's now or never 
I ain't gonna live forever 
I just wanna live while I'm alive 


It's my life! 

These are my confessions 


Just when I thought I said all I could say 
My chick on the side said she got one on the way 


These are my confessions 


If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all 
Damn near cried when I got that phone call 
I'm so thrown and I don't know what to do 
But to give you part two of mine 


You better stand tall 
When they're calling you out 

Don't bend, don't break 
Baby, don't back down 

These are my confessions 


It's now or never 
I ain't gonna live forever 


These are my confessions 


I just wanna live while I'm alive 


It's my life 


Just when I thought I said all I can say 
My chick on the side said she got one on the way 


These are my confessions 


I just wanna live while I'm alive! 


It's my life!
