Can you dig it? There's something in the air tonight
Got a one way ticket, baby don't you wanna ride?
Got to make it, make it to the other side
I've got demons snapping at my heels tonight

I just want to run away, turn me loose
Got people around running me down, I can't stay
I just want to get away, I just want to get away now
Get them off my back today

Can you feel it? I'm stuck inside in a hurricane
Chasing rainbows, can't you see I'm going insane?
I wanna be a free man but I'm spinning on this crazy wheel
I'm jumping for the high bar, can't you dig it?
No longer know what I feel, can't you see?

I just want to run away, turn me loose
Got people around running me down, I can't stay
I just want to get away, I just want to get away now
Get them off my back today

I just wanna run away
Turn me loose, turn me loose
Turn me loose, turn me loose

Got to make it, got to make it
Got to break it, got to make it

I just want to run away, I just want to run away
Got people around running me down I can't stay
Can't stay no more no
I just want to get away, I just got to get away
Get them off my back today

I just want to run away
I just want to get away
Turn me loose, run away run away
Got people around running me down I can't stay
Runnin' away, runnin' away

I just want to run away
Just got to get away
Turn me loose, run away
Get them off my back today
