Love on the rocks ain't no surprise
Pour me a drink,
And I'll tell you some lies
Got nothing to lose,
So you just sing the blues, all the time

Gave you my heart, gave you my soul
You left me alone here
With nothing to hold
Yesterday's gone
Now all I want is a smile

First they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm

When they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say,
You've got to leave, just get away
We all know the song

You need what you need
You can say what you want
Not much you can do
When the feeling is gone
May be blue skies above,
But it's cool
When your love's on the rocks

First they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm

And when they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You got to leave, just get away
We all know the song

Love on the rocks
Ain't no big surprise
Just pour me a drink
And I'll tell you my lies
Yesterday 's gone
Now all I want is a smile.....
