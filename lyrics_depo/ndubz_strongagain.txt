One Day I Had to Punch up This One Yute for Tryin Make a Fool of Me
In My Hood there's Only So Many Opportunities
Look, I Carry a Tool for My Pride and My Jewelry
Now I Find Myself Stuck Serving the Community


See Me I Made a Change
I Didn't Expect No Fame
We Came From Practically Nuttin' To Thousands Screaming Our Name
A-List, Play list
Even My Mums Famous
I Would Do Anythin' for Some Source Stadium Status


See The Thing about Life Is That It's
It's Just Too Short
Leave The Best behind and Only Then You'll Find There's More to Life than You First Thought


Coz I
I Never Ever Ever Ever Thought That It Would Ever Get Better
Coz I
I Never Ever Ever Ever Thought That It Would Ever Get Better
See I
I Never Ever Ever Ever Thought That I Could Face This Weather
But Life
It Will Only Get Better
Trust Me It Will Only Get Better


Ha Ha Ha Ha

Ha Ha Ha Ha
Haa Heeey

Goin' Back To When I Was Young
And I, Treated Life like It Would Never End
But Then I Grew Up
Got A Little Clued Up
Then N-Dubz Blew Up
Finally On My Way


Coz If You Knew Where I Come From
Then You Would Understand Why I Sing This Song
Its Are Changa??
Yeah I Put My Hand Up
In Fact It Made Me Man Up
And Finally Make a Change


See The Thing about Life Is That It's
It's Just Too Short (Just Too Shortt)
Leave The Best behind and Only Then You'll Find There's More to Life than You First Thought


Coz I
I Never Ever Ever Ever Thought That It Would Ever Get Better
Coz I
I Never Ever Ever Ever Thought That It Would Ever Get Better
See I
I Never Ever Ever Ever Thought That I Could Face This Weather
But Life
It Will Only Get Better
Trust Me It Will Only Get Better

Coz I
I Didn't Ever Wana Sing This Song Again
I Didn't Ever Wana Sing This Song Again
I Didn't Ever Wana Sing This
Ever Wana Sing This Song Again

And I
I Don't Wana Walk This Road Again
And I Don't Have To Be Alone Again
I Can Hold My head High I'm Strong Again
I'm Strong Again


Money Made No Change
In fact it was More Pain
B's gone
Who's To Blame?
Look At All These Youths Today
Rollin' Round with 38's
Stickin Bredda's For the White Gold Chains Like 
Look I Didn't Mean To Hurt You Mate


Back In the Day I Used To Roll With Like 30 Mates
Never Had Clean Money
Always Had Dirty Plates
Be It Now
Were Grindin An Washin For Like 30 Days ??

Now We Make ??


Coz I
I Never Ever Ever Ever Thought That It Would Ever Get Better
Coz I
I Never Ever Ever Ever Thought That It Would Ever Get Better
See I
I Never Ever Ever Ever Thought That I Could Face This Weather
But Life
It Will Only Get Better
Trust Me It Will Only Get Better

Coz I
I Didn't Ever Wana Sing This Song Again
I Didn't Ever Wana Sing This Song Again
I Didn't Ever Wana Sing This
Ever Wana Sing This Song Again

And I
I Don't Wana Walk This Road Again
And I Don't Have To Be Alone Again
I Can Hold My head High I'm Strong Again
I'm Strong Again
