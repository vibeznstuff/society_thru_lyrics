Ain't nothin' wrong with it

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, L-O-V-E-E-E and affection

Oh, baby, I'm not asking for the world,
Maybe you can give me what I want
Baby, come hold me tight and when I'm drowning save me
Give it to me on a daily

If I'm your girl say my name, boy
Let me know I'm in control
We both grown. So, how we feel we can let it show
I-I-I won't play around
I-I-I, I wanna lay you down
I-I-I, I need you now, I need you now
Oh, oh

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, L-O-V-E-E-E and affection

Boy, lately you've been stingy with your time
Got me wondering, I'm wondering if I'm on your mind
Boy, I just wanna be in your possession
You say I'm the one you want. So, come express it

Don't slip, don't slip
'Cause a nigga might push up on it
Don't really wanna lose this moment
Why window-shop when you own this?
I-I-I don't put it down
I-I-I don't fuck around
I-I-I, I want you now, I want you now, oh, oh, whoa

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, L-O-V-E-E-E and affection

Can you love me for poor? (Let me know.)
I'm searching for my soul (Rorschach)
Whoever turned you cold (Beat this.)
You need to let 'em know

I can work miracles (What's up?)
I work it physical (physical)
And when I love you close
You can feel my heart beating through my clothes

Future

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, L-O-V-E-E-E and affection
