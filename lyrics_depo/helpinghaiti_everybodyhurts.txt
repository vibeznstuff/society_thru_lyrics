When the day is long and the night, the night is yours alone,


When youre sure youve had enough of this life, well hang on


Dont let yourself go, cause everybody cries and everybody hurts


Sometimes.... sometimes everything is wrong.


Now its time to sing along


When your day is night alone,


(hold on, hold on)


If you feel like letting go


If you think youve had too much of this life, well hang on..


Cause everybody hurts..


Take Comfort in your friends
everybody hurts..


Dont throw your hand, oh no


Dont throw your hand.
If you feel like youre alone, no, no, no, you are not alone


If youre on your own in this life, the days and nights are long,


When you think youve had too much of this life to...


...hang on


Everybody hurts, sometimes,


Everybody cries


And everybody hurts... sometimes


And everybody hurts... sometimes, so hold on, hold on


Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, repeat to fade
