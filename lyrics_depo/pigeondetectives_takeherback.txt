He's not sure what he should do
She's 17 he's 22
Is that too much of a difference?
So instead look what he done
He found a girl who's 31
Is that too much of a difference?

She's got everything he wants
She's got everything he needs
Take her back

Take her back
To her place.

She's got a mate who says 'Behave, you're not too bad but twice her age! '
Does that really make any difference?
He's had a few
We've all been there
Just 17, but he don't care
I don't think he knows the difference.

Cause...

She's got everything he wants
She's got everything he needs
Take her back

His mates found out
He feels a fool
They saw her on the bus to school
Should that really make any difference?
What would her dad say if he knew?
She's on her knees he's 22
I don't think he'd like the difference
Does that really make any difference.

Cause...

She's got everything he wants
She's got everything he needs
Take her back
