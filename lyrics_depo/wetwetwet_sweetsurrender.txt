Hey little fella, get your show together
I was listening in before
Now I don't care no more

Look around now (look around now)
It's always that it's gonna get me down
It's only begun

One look is all it took
I remember that sweet surrender
I recall, do you
That sweet surrender

Sweet surrender

My determination
Came creeping across the nation
Sure mistake for anyone
So you can't take home everyone
Cause it's only just begun

One look is all it took
To remember that sweet surrender
I recall, do you
That sweet surrender

I don't know, I don't care
Cause I'm living without you baby
Even when I know what's going on
Yeah it only took, one look, one glance
To set my heart for romance
Do you believe my sweet surrender

My sweet surrender

Hey little fella, now your show's together
I never wanted you to listen before
So why should I walk out the door
Stick around now (stick around now)
And so the story goes on through the night
It's only begun

One look is all it took
I remember that sweet surrender
Do you recall, cause I do
My sweet surrender

I don't know, I don't care
Cause I'm living without you baby
Even when I know what's going on
Yeah all it takes, one look, one glance
To set my heart for romance
One look is all it took
My sweet surrender

That sweet surrender
One look is all it took to remember
(I don't know and I don't care)
