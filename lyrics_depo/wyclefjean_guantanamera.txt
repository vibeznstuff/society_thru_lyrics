Guantanamera
Hey yo I'm standing at the bar with a, Cuban cigar
Guajila, Guantanamera
Hey, yo, I think she's eyeing me from afar
Guan-tana-mera...
Guajila Guan-tana-mera...



Yo, I wrote this in Haiti, overlooking Cuba
I asked her what's her name, she said, 'Guantanamera'
Remind me of an old latin song, my uncle used to play
On his old forty-five when he used to be alive
She went from a young girl, to a grown woman
Like a Virgin, so she sex with no average mahn
Peep the figure, move like a caterpillar
Fly like a butterfly, let your soul feel her glide
Pac Woman better yet Space Invader
If your name was Chun-Li, we'd be playin Street Fighter
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for your kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me



Guantanamera
Hey yo, I'm standin at the bar with a, Cuban cigar
Guajila, Guantanamera
Yo, I think she's eyeing me from afar
Guan-tana-mera...
Guajila Guan-tana-mera...


Soy una mujer, sincera
(I am a sincere woman)
Do you speak English?
De donde crecen las palmas
(From where the palm tree grows)
Can I buy you a drink?
Soy una mujer, sincera
(I am a sincere woman)
Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
De donde creeeeeeecen las palmas
(From where the palm tree grows)
You killin me
Y antes de morir, yo quiero
(And before I die, I want to)
..
cantar mis versos del alma
(sing the verses in my heart)
Te quiero mama, te quiero!!

Guantanamera
Aiyyo I'm standing at the bar with a, Cuban cigar
Guajila, Guantanamera
Hey yo John Forte, she's eyeing me from far
Guan-tana-mera...
Guajila Guan-tana-mera



Yo, she was a rose in Spanish Harlem, mamacita beg your pardon
Make stakes at a faster rate then she fornicates
Pure traits of genius, Goddess of Black Venus
Crab niggaz angry cause they can't get between us
to no sele-xion, smooth complex-ion
The lexicon of Lexington, parents came from Cuba
Part Mexican, pure sweet, dimes fell to her feet
She like Movado, and shook her hips like Delgado
And broke niggaz down from the Grounds to Apollo
and then some, she took her act sent it to dim sum
And waited patiently while the businessmen come
Call late on purpose, got even politicians nervous
And made plans to infiltrate the street secret service
This gentle flower, fertility was her power
Sweet persona, Venus Flytrap primadonna
Que sera que sera she turned dinero to dinera


Guantanamera
Hey yo I'm standing at the bar with a, Cuban cigar
Guajila Guantanamera
Hey yo... I think she's eyein me from afar
Guan-tana-mera...
Guajila Guan-tana-mera...
