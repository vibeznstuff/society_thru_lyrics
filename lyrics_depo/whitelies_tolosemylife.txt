He said to lose my life or lose my love
That's the nightmare I've been running from
So let me hold you in my arms a while
I was always careless as a child
And there's a part of me that still believes
My soul will soar above the trees
But a desperate fear flows through my blood
That our dead loves buried beneath the mud

Let's grow old together
And die at the same time
Let's grow old together
And die at the same time

I said I've got no time, I have to go
And I was more right than now I'll ever know
He said my heart is faint, will minds regret
And left him crying next to the chapel's steps

Let's grow old together
And die at the same time

Let's grow old together
And die at the same time

He said?

Let's grow old together
And die at the same time
Let's grow old together
And die at the same time

He said?

He said to lose my life or lose my love
That's the nightmare I've been running from
So let me hold you in my arms a while
I was careless as a child
There's a part of me that still believes
My soul will soar above the trees
A desperate fear flows through my blood
Our dead loves buried beneath the mud
A desperate fear flows through my blood
Our dead loves buried beneath the mud
