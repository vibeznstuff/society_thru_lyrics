They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love
They say that love's a word, a word we've only heard
But yet begin to know the meaning of

And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
and then some day
they may recall
we were not too young at all

Oh, Oh

And yet we're not too young to know
Oh, This love will last though years may go
and then some day
they may recall
we were not too young at all
