Beep, beep on
Now there goes my phone
And once again
I’m just hoping it’s a text from you
It ain’t right
Read your messages twice, thrice, four times a night it’s true
Everyday I patiently wait
Feeling like a fool but I do anyway
Nothing can feel as sweet and as real
Coz no way I would’ve waited in pain


And maybe it’s true I’m caught up on you
Maybe there’s a chance you’re stuck on me too
Maybe I’m wrong it’s all in my head
Maybe we're afraid of words we both hadn’t said 

I’m always connected online
Turn facebook/myspace all the time 
Hoping you've checked my profile
Just can't help wondering why you play it cool
But sometimes I’m hopelessly falling for you
Every night on the phone and I
In love with you and I know that you like it girl
All joking inside lets see you and I
Come out and say what you’re trying to hide




Like I really want you
I think I need you
Maybe I miss you
I’m thinking of you
Like I really want you
I think I need you
Maybe I miss you
I’m thinking of you
