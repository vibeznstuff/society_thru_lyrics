My dad came into my room holding his hat
I knew he was leaving, 
he sat on my bed told me some facts, son.
I have a duty, calling on me
You and your sister be brave my little soldier
And don't forget all I told ya
Your the mister of the house now remember this
And when you wake up in the morning give ya momma a kiss
Then I had to say goodbye

In the morning woke momma with a kiss on each eyelid,
Even though I'm only a kid 
Certain things can't be hid
Momma grabbed me 
Held me like I was made of gold 
But left her inner stories untold
I said, momma it will be alright 
When daddy comes home, tonight

Whether long range weapon or suicide bomber
Wicked mind is a weapon of mass destruction
Whether you're soar away sun or BBC 1
Misinformation is a weapon of mass destruction
You could a Caucasian or a poor Asian
Racism is a weapon of mass destruction
Whether inflation or globalization
Fear is a weapon of mass destruction

Whether Halliburton or Enron or anyone
Greed is a weapon of mass destruction
We need to find courage, overcome
Inaction is a weapon of mass destruction 
The skin under my chin is exploding again
I'm getting stress from some other children
I'm holding it in.
We taking sides like a politician
And if I get friction, we get to fighting
I defend my dad, he's the best of all men
And whatever he's doing, he's doing the right thing
It's frightening, but it makes me mad
Why do all these people seem to hate my dad
And if that aint enough now I got these spots
I go to sleep every night with my stomach in knots
And what's more, I can hear momma next door
Explore the radio for reports of war
And all we ever seem to do
Is hide the tears
Seem like daddy been gone for years
But he was right
Now I'm geared up for the fight
And he would be proud of me
If my daddy come home tonight
Listen me calmly 

Whether long range weapon or suicide bomber
Wicked mind is a weapon of mass destruction
Whether you're soar away sun or BBC 1
Misinformation is a weapon of mass destruction
You could a Caucasian or a poor Asian
Racism is a weapon of mass destruction
Whether inflation or globalization
Fear is a weapon of mass destruction

Whether Halliburton or Enron or anyone
Greed is a weapon of mass destruction
We need to find courage, overcome
Inaction is a weapon of mass destruction

My story stops here, lets be clear
This scenario is happening everywhere
And you ain't going to nirvana or farvana
You're coming right back here to live out your karma
With even more drama than previously, seriously
Just how many centuries have we been 
waiting for someone else to make us free
And we refuse to see
That people overseas suffer just like we
Bad leadership and ego's unfettered and free
Who feed one the people they're supposed to lead 
I don't need good people to pray and wait 
For the lord to make it all straight
There's only now, do it right. 
Cos I don't want your daddy, leaving home tonight
