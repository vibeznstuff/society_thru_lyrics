Yeah, you'll be all right when love comes around

What you going to do on your own?
Even wonder should you ever go home
Here come those feelings, can't be right
You think nobody's going to miss you tonight

Mistrusted
Heartbroke and busted
So where's the justice?

Going to be all right when love comes around
No hurricane wind blowing could slow you down
Yeah, you'll be all right when love comes around
It's going to come 'round, ooh, baby

You say that you've never known
The kind of love that gets down deep in your soul
You're still reeling from the fight
You wouldn't know it if it hit you tonight

Mistrusted
Heartbroke and busted
So where's the justice?

Going to be all right when love comes around
No hurricane wind blowing could slow you down
Yeah, you'll be all right when love comes around

And I will never know the questions you're asking
I know nothing at all
How can you stand upon the judgement you're passing
When you don't even know the cause?

Mistrusted
Heartbroke and busted
So where's the justice?

Going to be all right when love comes around
No hurricane wind blowing could slow you down
Yeah, you'll be all right when love comes around

Yeah, you'll be all right
Everybody say
Yeah, you'll be all right
Yeah, you'll be all right
