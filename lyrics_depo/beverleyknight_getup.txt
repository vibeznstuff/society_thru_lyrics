You stand tall while people sway
(True to your self)
Leave them fakers on the shelf
(Heed your calling)
Go and do your thing, I make I hear you say...

Get up, get up and hold your ground
You don't care what goes around
Stand up, stand up and hold your ground (stand up)
Hold your ground
Them no bigger than us
No bigger than we
No bigger than you
No bigger than me
Them no bigger than us
No bigger than we
No bigger than you
No bigger than me (hey hey)

(Get up! Get up!)
Yeah
(You gotta gotta!)
(Stand up! Stand up)
Stand up on me
(Get up! Get up!)
Alright
(You gotta gotta!)
(Stand up! Stand up!)
Yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha)
(Ah-ha-ah-ha-ah-ha)
(Ah-ha, ah-ha)
(Ah-ha-ah-ha-ah-ha)
Get up and
Stand up and
Hold it
Get up and
Stand up and
Hold it
Feel it!

(Don't feel no shame)
Let them know you're not the same
(Don't feel no way)
You stand tall while people sway
(True to your self)
Leave them fakers on the shelf
(Heed your calling)
Oh, go and do your thing, I make I hear you s-a-a-a-y...
