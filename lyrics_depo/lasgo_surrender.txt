You say that I can't trust you 
I don't know
Every time I'm near you 
I lose control
I must be out of my mind
To let you in 
Maybe I should try to find my strength within

It's only a matter of time
And I will surrender 
Just give me a little more time
To open my mind
It's only a matter of time
And I will surrender
Surrender to you ..

Fears, I leave them far behind 
To resist you I don't know how
Love sometimes can be unkind
Should I lay my heart on the line now
When temptation comes along 
I can't hide it ,I can't fight it
Feelings inside are getting strong
Do not deny it you've got it

Surrender
Surrender
Surrender
Surrender

It's only a matter of time
And I will surrender
Just give me a little more time
To open my mind
It's only a matter of time
And I will surrender
Surrender to you ..
