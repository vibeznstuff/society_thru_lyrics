Wherever you are
Its 3am and I'm awake
Imagine the light
Upon her blue transparanet face
True coloured glass
It filters down to warm the street
Faded

I'm the one who leads your mind
See my life in your design
True companion at your side

Gracious and good
When all around is turning bad
Restless and rave
When laid upon suburban grass
Your timing is right
Remove the sad persistent thought
Hold the cause

Well I'm the one who reads your mind
See my life in your design
True companion at your side

I'll give you something
When I'm not around
To make you smile
Outside that wasteland
And if only I can make it through
If you think it then it must be true

I'll be wherever you are
Wherever you are
