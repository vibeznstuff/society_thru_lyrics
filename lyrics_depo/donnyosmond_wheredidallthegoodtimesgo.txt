It's time to leave you
'Cause I got nothing more to give
I've got to begin to live
We've been lonely together too long

Oh, it's hard to leave you
But it's very much harder to stay
The good times are gone
But the memories of you linger on

Where did all the good times go?
Where did all the good times go?
Where did all the good times go?
They've gone so far away

It's time tomorrow
I'll be learning to live on my own
I think you when I have known
We've been lonely together too long

Oh, it's hard to leave you
But it's very much harder to stay
The good times are gone
But the memories of you linger on

Where did all the good times go?
Where did all the good times go?
Where did all the good times go?
They've gone so far away

Oh baby, where did all the good times go?
Where did all the good times go?
Where did all the good times go?
They've gone so far away

Where did all the good times go?
Where did all the good times go?
Where did all the good times go?
They've gone so far away
