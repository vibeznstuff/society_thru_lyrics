Take em out, take em out, bring em out dead
Shine em up, shine em up, shine the bald head
One gun, two gun, three gun, four
You're, mine, it's all about crime
Onyx! 


It's time to get live, live, live like a wire
I set a whole choir on fire (UHH!)
Well done, on the grill, shot skills kills
and no frills - they try to diss me? They gettin crispy
Ha, ha hah hah, AND WE DO IT LIKE THIS
In fact,  and jack Jack's
Cause they can burn in hell shit for all that I care
Beware the bald head the dread said is they fear
Stick-up's assassin, traction new reaction
These fuckin niggaz shoulda made the All Madden
Onyx is wreckin shit, slip slide step quick
 Infinite that gets crashed like a rented
The shit they write is black and white; well mines got mad color
Ain't that right, my blood brother?
Word up, raise it up!
We do it with the crew that don't give a fuck

So throw ya gunz in the air, throw ya gunz in the air
Buck buck like you don't care


Uh-oh!!  Heads up, cause we're droppin some shit
On your now shot-skills, Onyx tec-9 for a while
Keep your eyes open in the fight, I'ma swell em
The hardcore style, rowdy n wild, hits I'ma sell em (sell em)
To all competition slide back then listen
I'm kickin all that, shit to the doormat
Claimin this domain, cause mad pains
Blood stains, long range - got gats!
Crazy clips, I sink ships, cuttin faces like a pirate
I've never caught a flood, for the mad shit that I did
Heard, you got the word so observe
I shatter and splatter bodies that blows and bust nerds, OPEN!
I always leave my barrel smokin

Throw ya gunz in the air
And buck buck like you just don't care
Just throw ya gunz in the air
And buck buck like you just don't care
Just throw ya gunz in the air
And buck buck like you just don't care
Just throw ya gunz in the air
And buck buck like you just don't care


Ahhh, I hate your fuckin guts, and I hope that you die
Sticky Fingaz, the name, and my life is a lie
Cause I'm havin a bad day, so stay out of my way
And what the pistol packin people say you better obey
Just in the nick of time, I commit the perfect crime
Rip my heart, from my chest, put it right into a rhyme 9YEAH!
I don't feel pain cause it's all in the mind
And what's - mines is mines and, yours is mine
Don't fuckin blink or I'ma rob yo' ass blind
Onyx, is rippin shit, I got the tech nine
So what the plumber got boy buck buck buck buck
It's like a catastrophe, fuckin with me G
I'm a bald head with a kinfe
I want your money or your life
So, so, so, so?

So throw ya gunz in the air
And buck buck like ya just don't care
Just throw ya gunz in the air
And buck buck like you just don't care
Just throw ya gunz in the air
And buck buck like you just don't care
Just throw ya gunz in the air
