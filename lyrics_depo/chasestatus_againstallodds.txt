I was raised in a city with no heart,
Where there's no car,
Steppin' when it comes to be gettin' that dough fast,
I'm a hustler, I'm a, I'm a hustler
Raised on the battle field,
Born as a sufferer,
Before I had a deal I was still stackin' deals,
Get punked sell food to the customers,
Now I get love crews in the back o' the s class,
Dem can't move like dat y'na,
(I was raised in)
I come from where man were done for hardly nothin'
You can see it in the blues that I'm hardly frontin'
Got kids with guns in the heart of London,
Bulletproof vests like half a hundred,
There's no actors and actresses barely around here,
This matches them straps of Manchester,
Soon as you exit Stansted you might see...


(All the guys are no more getting into trouble)
Who's gettin' into trouble?
(But have always been)
Besides who has been
(When the odds are all against you
How can you win, yeah yeah)
How can you win?
How can you win?
(How can you win?)
How can you win?
How can you win?

I was raised in the city when they was out blazin' a philly,
I was on the 5 bus chasing the titties
At the back of the class undoin' bras with a stiffy,
Tenisha, Testa, Leslie and Richie,
It's a cold cold world,
Gangstas livin' in a po po world,
So I'm in a co co with a go go girl,
Escaping reality that I know so well
But when ya a kid ya don't know no betta,
Boys find trouble tryin' to find that cheddar,
Money breeds envy
Might get set-up
When pockets get empty
N*ggas get jealous
Kill 'em then told 'em
What people, fella?
I think you are stretching that ketchup from the south of da border
And all across the east has got round here
Gotta see it to believe it



Let me tell you something
Look, look

Baby just because I'm a Londoner
Now I love London town but London's foul
London's a merry go round, a cycle of life full of ups 'n downs
Cos up till now we could of never won
With the odds against us a million to one
See that will dismiss it but they can see in the sum
Don't fight says Jordan now you really get a stiffy on

(How can you win, yeah yeah)
How can I win?
How can I win?
(How can you win, yeah yeah)
How can I win?
How can I win?
