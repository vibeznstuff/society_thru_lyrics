We say "No, not in our name."

It's in the things that you say and you don't say
You don't know it cause you're such a fuckin' cliche
The way you define them &amp; us
Those you fear and those you trust
You know a black guy and he's very articulate
You know a Mexican and she's honest and diligent
You don't see color but some people need discipline
A thug is a thug, some people need to learn a lesson

Your justifications, one dead give away
Your qualifications, one dead give away
You'd never endorse the Jim Crowe days
But the malice in your voice is a God damn give away

Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
A bigot with a check list
Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
You don't get a pass when you're talkin' your shit
Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
A bigot with a check list
Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
You don't get a pass, get a pass for your ignorance

Black lives matter and you don't know why
And reverse racism isn't a real thing
No you weren't alive in the time of slavery
But that's no excuse to ignore its legacy
Not afraid of refugees
But don't want a mosque built on your street
Offended by the claim of bigotry
More than the racism in your face

Your justifications, one dead give away
Your qualifications, one dead give away
You'd never endorse the Bull Connor days
But the malice in your voice is a God damn give away

Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
A bigot with a check list
Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
You don't get a pass when you're talkin' your shit
Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
A bigot with a check list
Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
You don't get a pass, get a pass for your ignorance

You fly the flag of the Confederacy
You say to celebrate your history
The South was fighting to save slavery
To preserve and protect white supremacy

Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
A bigot with a check list
Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
You don't get a pass when you're talkin' your shit
Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
A bigot with a check list
Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
You don't get a pass, get a pass for your ignorance

Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
Just 'cause you don't know you're sexist
Just 'cause you don't know you're fascist
You don't get a pass for your ignorance
Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
Just 'cause you don't know you're sexist
Just 'cause you don't know you're fascist
You don't get a pass, get a pass for your ignorance
