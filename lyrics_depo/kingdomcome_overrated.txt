Eyes like a flame
Looking cut and clean
She's got her ways
To twist the magic in my dreams
She had me living in a cloud
Until I saw and found out
She shared her love all over town
Oh, yeah, I've gotta get out

Overrated, uh-huh
Overrated
Oh yes she was
Overrated, uh-huh
Overrated

Took her along
Walking through the park
She did not care
'Bout the beauty of the stars
I kept on digging deep inside
To show her wrong and what's right
Too bad she fell so far from grace
Oh yeah, my time was a waste

Overrated, uh-huh
Overrated
Oh yes she was
Overrated, uh-huh
Overrated

She sure was lacking
Some of that sensitivity
Oh, yeah

Overrated, uh-huh
Overrated
Oh yes she was
Overrated, uh-huh
Overrated
