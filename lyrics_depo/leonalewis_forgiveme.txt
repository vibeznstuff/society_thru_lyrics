There's a first time for everything 
It's definitely one of them nights 
I knew when I looked in his eyes 
That he was gonna be trouble for me 
I never wanted to lie 
I knew that my baby would cry 
If he knew what we were doing 
But if his love don't pass the test 
I gotta get it from somewhere else 
When I'm gone and I need a man 
Hope he understands 
Forgive me baby 

I gotta take a chance tonight 
So I'm doing me, myself and I 
Can wait no more 
Sitting all alone 
Man, I really hope 
Hope you forgive me 
Oh oh 
Hope you forgive me 
Oh oh 
Hope you forgive me 
Oh oh 
I can wait no more 
Man, I really hope 
Hope you forgive me 

Been a long time since I 
Did something good for myself 
But why should I be put through hell? 
He's doing what he wanna do 
I finally found somebody else 
Who really wants to make me feel 
Things that I've been missing so long 
And his love always passed the test 
It's a shame I had to look somewhere else 
When I'm gone and I need a man 
I just hope that he understands 
Forgive me baby 

I gotta take a chance tonight 
So I'm doing me, myself and I 
Can wait no more 
Sitting all alone 
Man, I really hope 
Hope you forgive me 
Oh oh 
Hope you forgive me 
Oh oh 
Hope you forgive me 
Oh oh 
I can wait no more 
Man, I really hope 
Hope you forgive me 

Forgive me but I need to be loved too 
Forgive me but I can't wait around for you 
Forgive me if I found a man 
Who understands just what I need 
Forgive me but I need to be loved too 
Forgive me if I can't wait around for you 
Forgive me if I found a man who understands 
Forgive me baby 

I gotta take a chance tonight 
So I'm doing me, myself and I 
Can wait no more 
Sitting all alone 
Man, I really hope 
Hope you forgive me 
Oh oh 
Hope you forgive me 
Oh oh 
Hope you forgive me 
Oh oh 
I can wait no more 
Man, I really hope 
Hope you forgive me 

I gotta take a chance tonight 
So I'm doing me, myself and I 
Can wait no more 
Sitting all alone 
Man, I really hope 
Hope you forgive me
