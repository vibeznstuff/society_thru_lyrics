A soldier's heart
Reflecting back at me
I keep seeing mutilated faces
Even in my dreams
Distorted images
Flashing rapidly
Psychotically abusing me
Devouring my brain

The eyes of the insane
On a demented campaign

Tortured spirits
Will not let me rest
These thoughts of mutilated faces
Completely possessed
Fragmented images
Flashing rapidly
Psychotically abusing me
Whirling through my head

Shellshocked
Battle fatigue
Overwhelming anxiety
Flashbacks
Panic attacks
Death raising it's ugly face at me!

Got to make it stop
Can't take it any more
They're all dead
Keep haunting me
They just keep coming back for more!

The eyes of the insane
On a demented campaign
Flashbacks
Panic attacks
Death raising it's ugly face at me!

Got to make it stop
Can't take it any more!
Death's face keeps haunting me
And just keeps coming back for more!

Got to make it stop
Can't take it any more!
Death's face keeps haunting me
And just keeps coming back for more!

A soldier
Of misfortune
I owe my pain and suffering
To this hell
These demons
Ripping through my soul
Evil's relentless hostility
Won't let me sleep

Shellshocked
Battle fatigue
Devastating insanity
Flashbacks
Panic attacks
Death's rotting
He's coming for me!!
