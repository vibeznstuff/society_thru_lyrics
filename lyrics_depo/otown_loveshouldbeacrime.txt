Words like love and happiness
Never seem to stand up, Baby
When you put 'em to the test, yeah
You say that you're a poet
That your love's a work of art
But you can't play love by numbers, Babe
Gotta play it all by heart

Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby
It happens all the time
How you play me, play me, play me
Playin' with my mind
Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby
You're makin' me go crazy (Ah ah ah ah...)
And if you all that love, then love should be a crime

Honesty bites the dust
Everytime I hear you sayin'
That love is never lost, yeah
Did you read it in a book?
Did you see it in a magazine?
Do you think that I'm some new expo?
Do you think I'm so naive?

Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby
It happens all the time
How you play me, play me, play me
Playin' with my mind
Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby
You're makin' me go crazy (Ah ah ah ah...)
And if you all that love, then love should be a crime

Love should be a crime...

You and me
Suddenly
We got nothin' to say
But the words get in the way

Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby
It happens all the time
How you play me, play me, play me
Playin' with my mind
Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby
You're makin' me go crazy (Ah ah ah ah...)
And if you call that love, then all it was was a pocket full of nothing but a suicidal cause
And if you call that love then love should be a ... crime
