I remember them days when I used to hang in the club
So addicted to fame they say it's the same as a drug
Not a lame or a scrub no that ain't what it was
Knew this girl is somebody else's, I think I'm in love
She know she bad, but what's new
Maybe the baddest, I want you girl
I gotta have it, but it do girl
You cool girl, play by the rules girl
Cause, we catching feelin's fa sho
You know the game and you know how it go
Been keepin' shit on the low
Girl I'm a g I'm a stick to the code
Too many times I've been down this road
Nobodies hurt if nobody knows
Go head and call yo nigga tell him you ain't comin' home


I got you creepin' got you creepin' yea
You got a man at home, you know he cheatin'
But you won't leave him what's the reason?
You know yo man a scrub, that ain't no real love
You'd rather get even you don't need him no
He got you chasin' waterfalls
That red light special got me gone
Girl tell me why you hollin' on
You don't know, you don't know


Ay, I know I got a lot of hoes
But I ain't never show this side before
Even my mamma knows, so Señorita vámonos
If I never told you, that I wan't you to myself girl
Cause I'm down to show you, that I want you to be my ho




So you creepin', yeayea, you creepin' on the down low
Nobodies supposed to know
So you creepin', yeayea, you creepin' on the down low
