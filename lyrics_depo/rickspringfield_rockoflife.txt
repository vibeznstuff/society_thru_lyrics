(I feel the big beat...)
(Rock Of Life...)

Big beat talk to me 
Waking up blind with the house on fire

Well I pick up my guitar, (I tune up)
I look in the mirror 
It's like a stranger in my hand (the baby is crying) 
There comes a time when the boy must leave (get up) 
And the man has to enter 
For the soul to understand (all of the changes) 
As if it ain't hard enough this life I'm living in 
I was caught with my guard down 
When the world came knocking

I feel the big beat, the Rock Of Life 
Big beat talk to me
Hey!  Whoo!
I feel the back beat, the Rock Of Life
Waking up blind with the house on fire

Is it something in my head (look up) 
Or the time of season 
Or the little boy in my hands (must be a reason) 
Yeah, there's new meaning in my life (a shake-up) 
But there's pain and confusion 
And I'm trying to understand (all of the changes) 
I've been cut so deep but I can't make it bleed 
I was caught with my head in the sand 
When the world came knocking

I feel the big beat, the Rock Of Life 
Big beat talk to me
Hey!  Whoo!
I feel the back beat, the Rock Of Life
Waking up blind with the house on fire

It ain't no perfect life 
This one I'm living in 
And I was caught with my guard down 
When the world came knocking

I feel the big beat, the Rock Of Life 
Big beat talk to me
Hey!  Whoo!
I feel the back beat, the Rock Of Life
Waking up blind with the house on fire
