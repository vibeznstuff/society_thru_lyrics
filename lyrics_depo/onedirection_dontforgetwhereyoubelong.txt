Been a lot of places.
I've been all around the world.
Seen a lot of faces.
Never knowing where I was.

On the horizon.
Mmm, well, I know, I know, I know, I know the sun will be rising
Back home.

Living out of cases,
Packing up and taking off.
Made a lot of changes
But not forgetting who I was.

On the horizon.
Ooh, well, I know, I know, I know, I know the moon will be rising
Back home.

Don't forget where you belong. Home.
Don't forget where you belong. Home.
If you ever feel alone, don't.
You are never on your own.
And the proof is in this song.

I've been away for ages
But I've got everything I need.
I'm flicking through the pages.
I've written in my memory.

I feel like I'm dreaming.
Oh, so I know, I know, I know, I know that I'm never leaving.
No, I won't go.

Don't forget where you belong. Home.
Don't forget where you belong. Home.
If you ever feel alone, don't.
You are never on your own.
And the proof is in this song.

Lights off when they should be on.
Even stars in the sky look wrong.
Short days but the lights are long
When I think of the things I've done
Don't matter how far I've goneâ€”
I'm always free to run home.
Oh.

Don't forget where you belong. Home.
Don't forget where you belong (don't forget it). Home.
If you ever feel alone, don't.
You are never on your own.
Never, never, never.

Don't forget where you belong. Home.
Don't forget where you belong (don't forget it). Home.
If you ever feel alone, don't.
You are never on your own (you are never).
And the proof is in this song.

Home.
Don't forget it.
Home.
If you ever feel alone, don't.
You are never on your own (you are never).
And the proof is in this song.

Never forget it.
This song.
Don't forget it!
No, I'll never forget it.
This song.
You will never...
