It's amazing
We go through changes
When times get crazy
It's up and down
It's hot and cold
These complications
Just keep on coming
There ain't no running
When it comes to life
That's how it goes

Round and round we go
Sometimes it feels like
We're on a roller coaster ride
Baby don't you know
It could eat you up
If you try to keep it all inside

Seems like hard times come easy
We do a lot of hanging on these days
But the heart finds a reason
And love always seems to find a way
Even if it hurts
Even if it hurts us baby

There's gonna be thunder
There's gonna be rain
There's gonna be those times
We both get caught up in the pain
The realization
Keeps sinking in
The way you make it
Is learn to take it on the chin

Round and round we go
It's just a another day
With trouble knocking at your door
Baby don't you know
We can work it out
'Cause we always seem to find a cure

Seems like hard times come easy
We do a lot of hanging on these days
But the heart finds a reason
And love always seems to find a way
Even if it hurts
Even if it hurts you baby
Even if it hurts
Even if it hurts you baby
Yeah, yeah-yeah

Round and round we go
Sometimes it feels like
We're on a roller coaster ride
But baby don't you know
We'll keep holding on
Through the changes that we feel inside

Seems like hard times come easy
We do a lot of hanging on these days
But the heart finds a reason
And love always seems to find a way
