To feel forgiveness, you gotta forgive
Do you see the stars or the darkness begin?
You fight your war, I fought for my life
You pay your dues and I'll pay mine

It's not war, just the end of love
Just like before but it's never enough
Oh it's never enough

You fight your war, I fight for my life
You pay your dues, and I won't pay mine
To feel forgiveness you gotta forgive
It's lost on me, I believe in revenge

It's not war, just the end of love
You've got the looks
But I've got the stars
It's not war, just the end of love
To feel some tenderness
Do you have to give up?
Do you have to give up?
Ooh do you have to give up?

It's not war, just the end of love
(just the end of...)
Just like before, but it's never enough
It's not war just the end of love
You weathered the storm but sheltered the loss
but sheltered the loss
but sheltered the loss
