Should've kissed you there 
I should've held your face 
I should've watched those eyes 
Instead of run in place 
I should've called you out 
I should've said your name 
I should've turned around 
I should've looked again 

But oh, I'm staring at the mess I made 
I 'm staring at the mess I made 
I 'm staring at the mess I made 
As you turn, you take your heart and walk away 

Should've held my ground 
I could've been redeemed 
For every second chance 
That changed its mind on me 
I should've spoken up 
I should've proudly claimed 
That oh my head's to blame 
For all my heart's mistakes 

But oh, I'm staring at the mess I made 
I 'm staring at the mess I made 
I 'm staring at the mess I made 
As you turn, you take your heart and walk away 

And it's you, and it's you 
And it's you, and it's you 
And it's falling down, as you walk away 
And it's on me now, as you go 

But oh, I'm staring at the mess I made 
I 'm staring at the mess I made 
I 'm staring at the mess I made 
As you turn, you take your heart and walk away 

And it's falling down, as you walk away 
And it's on me now, as you go 

But oh, I'm staring at the mess I made 
I 'm staring at the mess I made 
I 'm staring at the mess I made 
As you turn, you take your heart and walk away
