When I came home last night
You wouldn't make love to me
You went fast asleep
YOu wouldn't even talk to me
said I'm so crazy
Coming home intoxicated
I said I just wanna love ya
(I just wanna love you baby)
Guess that's why I'm so elated (C'mon girl)

Give it to me baby (give to me baby)
Give it to me baby (give to me baby)
Make it hot like you've had enough
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
Just give it to me baby
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
I'll make you hot like you had enough

Give it to me
Give me that stuff
that funk
that sweet
that funky stuff
(Give it to me)
give me that stuff
that funk
that sweet
that funky stuff
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give me that stuff
that sweet, funky stuff

Oooooh HOW woo

(Give to me baby)

When I was high as the sky
Out all night just dancing
You say let's go home (c'mon, I'm tired let's go home)
That's the time I start romancin'
You say "how can I love ya?" 
(how can I love you baby)
"When your body keeps on moving"
I say "Wait til I sqeeze you" (oh)
Maybe then you'll start to groovin'
(c'mon girl)

Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
(I betcha) I'll make ya hot like you had enough
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
(Just give it to me babyy)
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
(I betcha) I'll make ya hot like you had enough

Give it to me
Give me that stuff
that funk
that sweet
that funky stuff
(Give it to me)
give me that stuff
that funk
that sweet
that funky stuff
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give me that stuff
that sweet, funky stuff
