Everybody really wants to get to know you
Put your middle finger up and let the haters know
Should be stepping to the rhythm that I showed you
Like I showed you, look what I told you.


Turn the lights down
Bring the house down
Everybody here to party do your thing now
You’re not no newbie, headline your movie
Before the cops come out and people try to sue ya


See the light, in your eyes, makes you shine, boy you got it
Don’t let them bring, bring you down
bring, bring you down cos your bringing it now, oh you’re bringing it now
See the light, in your eyes, makes you shine, boy you got it
Don’t let them bring, bring you down
bring, bring you down cos your bringing it now, oh you’re bringing it now


Certain people want your picture for the papers
All your fans want your posters from the magazines
They wanna pin you up they wanna love and hate ya
You know they’re traitors, They’ll make you famous


Turn the lights down
Bring the house down
Everybody here to party do your thing now
You’re not no newbie, headline your movie
Before the cops come out and people try to sue ya


See the light, in your eyes, makes you shine, boy you got it
Don’t let them bring, bring you down
bring, bring you down cos your bringing it down, oh you’re bringing it down
See the light, in your eyes, makes you shine, boy you got it
Don’t let them bring, bring you down
bring, bring you down cos your bringing it down, oh you’re bringing it down


From the start they had your back
Parraell love your aligning them??
Rising shiners I'm light on them
Now they’re hoping skies turn black
Bring me down but they’re never gonna pin me down, I’m betting my life on that
See me now, never gonna see me now even when I’ve passed and dashed
They’re on, talking like the speed, talking bright lights on me.
So bright I can hardly see, like I come in a movie scene
That's why they smile at my face but behind my back they can run me down, wait
How can I break this down, simple never gonna bring me down!


See the light, in your eyes, makes you shine, boy you got it
Don’t let them bring, bring you down
bring, bring you down cos your bringing it down, oh you’re bringing it down
See the light, in your eyes, makes you shine, boy you got it
Don’t let them bring, bring you down
bring, bring you down cos your bringing it down, oh you’re bringing it down
