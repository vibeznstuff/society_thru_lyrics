Yeah
Talkin' bout a real friend
Set your mind at ease baby
uh
aint nonthin' wrong wit that


I guess we both havent seen some brighter days
Some how the love we shared had slipped away
Still I wanna be the one who keeps you safe and warm
Let me be the one (one)
Although things with me and you didnt quite work out
For you theres this special place deep in my heart
Though I wanna extend mine on conditional love
Let me be the one (yeah hey)


If you need a friend
Let me be the one
Some one that you call (Call)
Wanna be the one
Do it all (all)
(You dont have to phone)
Just let me be the one
(Let me be the one)


Promises made they've all would take affend
Still honey i'm not afraid to call you friend
Take a look and I know you see the possibilties
Let me be the one (one)
To see you smile theres nonthing i won't do
Cause honey i only want whats best for you
You are a shining star just stay the way you are
Let me be the one (one one heohh)
