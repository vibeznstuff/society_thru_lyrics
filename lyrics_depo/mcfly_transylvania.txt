Anne Boleyn she kept a tin,
Which all her hopes and dreams were in,
She plans to run away with him, forever (never to be seen again)
Leaves a note and starts to choke,
Can feel the lump that's in her throat,
It's raining and she leaves her coat in silence.

We're sorry but we disagree
The boy is vermin, can't you see?
We'll drown his sins and misery
And rip him out of history


People marching to the drums,
Everybody's having fun to the sound of love,
Ugly is the world we're on
If I'm right then prove me wrong
I'm stunned (to find a place we belong)

Who is your lover,
I couldn't tell,
When hell freezes over,
That's when I'll tell,
Who is your lover,
I couldn't tell,
When will this stop.


Racing,
Pacing,
In the dark,
She's searching for a lonely heart,
She finds him but his heart has stopped,
She breaks down.

Sorry but your majesty,
Refusing orders from the queen
Results in a monstrosity


Remembers a voice and hears him sing
