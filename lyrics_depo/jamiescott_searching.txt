I play a 6 string for a livin' 
But I ain't about to give in 
'Cos I'm constantly just searchin for that vibe 
I believe in what I'm doin 
Though at times my life feels ruined 
And my confidence needs lifting, woah 

Confidence is a word I hide behind 
Truth is I'm insecure inside 
And thats no lie 
When the world conspires to hold me back in line 
Feel like nothin's goin right, 
Although I try so hard, baby 

Oh this is what you wanna see, 
That they won't take the soul from me,no way 
And thats the reason why 

I play a 6 string for a livin' 
But I ain't about to give in 
'Cos I'm constantly just searchin for that vibe 
I believe in what I'm doin 
Though at times my life feels ruined 
And my confidence needs lifting, woah 

What's the point in tryin to knock me down? 
Don't even hear the words you say right now 
And that's not right 
There's no rhyme or reason to what you say, 
Don't you think its about time I had my day? 
I don't know why, ooh baby 

So open up your eyes and see, 
Cos it won't take the soul from me, no way 
And that's the reason why 

I play a 6 string for a livin' 
But I ain't about to give in 
'Cos I'm constantly just searchin for that vibe 
I believe in what I'm doin 
Though at times my life feels ruined 
And my confidence needs lifting, woah 

I hold my head up to the sky 
And I feel no shame 
I walk the lonely streets at night 
And I feel no pain 

Oh why'd you see 
What its having over me 
And thats the reason why 

I play a 6 string for a livin' 
And I ain't about to give in 
'Cos I'm constantly just searchin for that vibe 
I believe in what I'm doin' 
Though at times my life feels ruined 
And my confidence needs lifting, woah
