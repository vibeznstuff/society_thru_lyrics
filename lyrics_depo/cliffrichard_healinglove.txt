Hey my friend
I know too well
The pressures in this life are real
You gotta come out fighting
When they ring your bell
Stand up for the way you feel

You can't let it get you down
You can't let it make you run away
Got to keep your dreams alive
We can do it, but we'll only make it work together


When it all comes down to the push and shove
We can make it thru, we can rise above
'Cos you know that we've got the power of
Healin' love
Talkin' 'bout healin' love

Now I can see
That you're feeling sad
Some one's chosen your heart to steal
Hey, my friend
You can take my hand
And I'll show your heart a power that's real

It will never let you down
It will always open any door
So pick the pieces off the ground
Because you may have lost the battle but we'll win this war



So wipe away your tears, you can put away your gun
And get ready to receive the strongest medicine
