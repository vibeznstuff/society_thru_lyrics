(Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart)
Love's got a hold on my heart
(Love's got a hold on my heart)

I'm calling out
Won't somebody out there hear my SOS (SOS)
Throw me a life line please, and save me
There's no doubt
Baby, you took me prisoner I confess
When you crossed my defences
And captured my heart

And now it's too late to put up a fight
I thought I was strong but as hard as I try
Can't break away
Darling, there's no way out
Nothing can help me now
Love's got a hold on my heart
(My heart, my heart, heart, heart, heart)
(Love's got a hold of my heart)

There's no escape (there's no escape)
Now I'm like a damsel in distress
Trapped in this fairy tale forever (ooh ooh)
And no mistake
Its tragic but I'll have to face the truth I guess
And live ever more resigned to my fate

Cos now it's too late to put up a fight
I thought I was strong but try as I might
Can't break away
Darling, there's no way out
Nothing can help me now
Love's got a hold on my heart,
Yeah, yeah
Love's got a hold on my heart

Hold on my heart
Hold on my heart
(Love's got a hold on my,
Its got a hold on my heart)
(Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart)
Oh oh
(Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart)
Yeah
Ooh oh

And now its too late to put up a fight
I thought I was strong but try as I might
Can't break away
Darling, there's no way out
Nothing can help me now
Love's got a hold on my heart

Can't break away
Darling, there's no way out
Nothing can help me now
Love's got a hold on my heart (ooh ooh)
Love's got a hold on my heart
