One Mississippi, two Mississippi
Counting down the seconds
Standing in the wreckage of love
On a cold grey Jackson dawn
Oh I just can't watch this, sure can't stop this
I keep waiting, your tail lights are fading
I see your already gone
Half of who I used to be, one Mississippi

Lipstick on the coffee cup
I know I should wash it up
But maybe I'll just wait here for a little while
I run my fingers around the top
Where your lips were I just stop
Cause I, I can almost see your smile

And it's one Mississippi, two Mississippi
Counting down the seconds
Standing in the wreckage of love
On a cold grey Jackson dawn

And I know everybody's got their demons
Everybody's got their reasons
Why they leave when they run
Oh but baby I could have helped you through it
You built a wall and I couldn't get to it
Now I'm waiting for the rain, and the pain to come

And it's one Mississippi, two Mississippi
Counting down the seconds
Standing in the wreckage of love
On a cold grey Jackson dawn
Oh I just can't watch this, sure can't stop this
I keep waiting, your tail lights are fading
I see your already gone
Half of who I used to be, one Mississippi

Oh one Mississippi yeah yeah yeah oh oh oh
