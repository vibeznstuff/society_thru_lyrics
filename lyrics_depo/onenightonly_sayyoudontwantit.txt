Talk all the talk with a poet's style
Tongue like electric, eyes like a child
Eye on your wives and the classic cars
Live like a savior, live like the stars

Talk all the talk with a model's smile
Tongue like electric, eyes like a child
Buy all your highs and the classic cars
Die on the front page, just like the stars

The big screens, the plastic-made dreams
Say you don't want it, say you don't want it
It's our world, the picture-book girls
Say you don't want it, say you don't want it
Don't you ask me if it's love, my dear
Love don't really mean a thing 'round here
The fake scenes the plastic-made dreams
Say you don't want it, say you don?t want it

Pace all the rooms with a jealous style
Tongue like electric, eyes like a child
Paint all your soul with the brand designs
Preach like a savior, heart on the line
Talk all the talk with a model's smile
Tongue like electric, eyes like a child
Buy all your highs and the classic cars
Die on the front page, just like the stars

The big screens, the plastic-made dreams
Say you don't want it, say you don't want it
It's our world, the picture-book girls
Say you don't want it, say you don't want it
Don't you ask me if it's love, my dear
Love don't really mean a thing 'round here
The fake scenes the plastic-made dreams
Say you don't want it, say you don't want it

The big screens, the plastic-made dreams
Say you don't want it, say you don't want it
It's our world, the picture-book girls
Say you don't want it, say you don't want it

The big screens, the plastic-made dreams
Say you don't want it, say you don't want it
It's our world, the picture-book girls
Say you don?t want it, say you don't want it

Don't you ask me if it's love, my dear
Love don't really mean a thing 'round here
The fake scenes the plastic-made dreams
Say you don?t want it, say you don't want it

Say you don't want it, say you don't want it
Say you don't want it, say you don't want it
