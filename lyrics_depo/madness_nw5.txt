Ooh, I watched you grow up
Only to despise
I seen the madness stack up
Through tarpaulin eyes

I have heard you come up
Believing your own lies
Witnessed the blessing rise up
In a, a very strange disguise

Though you have become a burden
One thing remains, that's for certain
I will love you all my life
But without you in my life

Ooh, I watched you climb up
I seen you come alive
From those very humble beginnings
In NW5

Though we face the final curtain
One thing remains, that's for certain
I will love you all my life
But without you in my life

I would give you everything
For just the smile you bring
For just the song to sing
I would give you everything
For just that smile you bring
For just that song to sing, I sing now

Yes, I watched you grow up
Only to despise
Witnessed the blessing rise up
In a, a very strange disguise

Nothing, it seems, lasts forever
People change just like the weather
Some for good and sometimes never
I hope things work out for the better

I would give you everything
For just the smile you bring
For just the song to sing
I would give you everything
For just the smile you bring
For just the song to sing, I sing

Nothing, it seems, lasts forever
People change just like the weather
Some for good and sometimes never
I hope things work out for the better

I would give you everything
For just the smile you bring
For just the song to sing
I would give you everything
For just the smile you bring
For just the song to sing, I sing

I would give you everything
For just the smile you bring
For just the song to sing, I sing now
