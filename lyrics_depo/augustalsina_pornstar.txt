Let me put your mind to rest
I'm nothing like that other guy
Ima put yo ass to bed, just call me a lullaby
Believe it, believe it
Girl I'll be your quarterback, receive it
Go deep, baby work them lips no time to speak
When I lay back, shawty don't know how to act
She ready when the lights go off she climb on top
Her body rocking we don't stop
No handle bars or falling off, cause cause


She ride me like a porn star
She ride me like a porn star
She ride me like a pro she did this shit before
I hold her tight no letting go till she say she can't take no more
I'm speechless
All I say is oooooooh
She ride, she ride
She ride, she ride, she ride
All I say is oooooooh
She ride me like a porn star
She ride me like a porn star
She ride me like a porn star
She ride me like a porn star


She ride it like she never gonna ride this dick again
She thinking like a G and she ain't never giving in
She ride it in the back of my car, on the bar, 
on the stash, on the bed she ain't scared
Cause when I lay back, shawty don't know how to act
She ready when the lights go off she climb on top
Her body rocking we don't stop
No handle bars or falling off, cause cause



Go girl keep riding 
Keep riding girl, keep riding
