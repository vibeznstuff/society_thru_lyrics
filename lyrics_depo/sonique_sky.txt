Look at me
It really was not easy
But I can breathe
And I'm so grateful 'cause I can see
I am free to do exactly what I please
So come with me to a place where we can be

Ooh I wanna touch the sky
I wanna fly so high
Ooh I wanna hold you
I wanna love you tonight
Ooh I wanna touch the sky
I wanna fly so high
Ooh I wanna satisfy
I wanna make you cry

Follow me to a place where we can be
Absolutely free
To be exactly what you want to be
Completely, lose control that's when I need you more
Give me the key, to set your heart and spirit free

Ooh I wanna touch the sky
I wanna fly so high
Ooh I wanna hold you
I wanna love you tonight
Ooh I wanna touch the sky
I gonna fly so high
Ooh I wanna satisfy
I wanna make you cry

I know what I want
And I know I need it right now
Gonna take you on a journey
To a far away place now
Gonna take you on a journey to a far away place now

Ooh I wanna touch the sky
I wanna fly so high
Ooh I wanna hold you
I wanna love you tonight
Ooh I wanna touch the sky
I wanna fly so high
Ooh I wanna satisfy
I wanna make you cry

Ooh like a bird in the sky
Just you and I
I'm gonna fly like a bird in the sky
Just you and I
We're gonna fly like a bird in the sky
Just you and I

I wanna love you now
I wanna take you high
I wanna give you everything
That you desire

I wanna love you now
I wanna take you high
I wanna give you everything

I wanna love you now
I wanna take you high
I wanna give you everything
That you desire
