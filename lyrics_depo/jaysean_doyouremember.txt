I've been thinkin' about you
And how we used to be then. Yeah
Back when
It didn't have to end
We can start again.


There's nothing left to say.
Don't waste another day.
It's just you and me tonight,
Everything will be okay.
If it's alright with you,
Then it's alright with me.
Baby let's take this time,
Let's make new memories.
Do you remember 
All the fun times we had?
Do you remember 
All the fun times we had?
Let's bring it back, oh 
So long since you've been missing
It's good to see you again
How are you, how you doin', and how about we?
Don't let this happen again.




Yo, aye, girl yo,
Bring it back to the time when you and me had just begun,
When I was still you're number one.
While it might seem far-fetched baby girl,
But it can be done.
I got this feeling for ya blazing and it's hot just like the sun,
Know you feel it too my girl just breathe up
And the good vibes run.
Girl take a sip out the champagne,
Take a little trip down my lane,
My girl.
While you're out every night I will feel alright,
Nigga clearly this girl is a my world.
Don't change up now rearrange it girl,
I'm a telling this straight into my world.
How many years say ya want come kiss this,
Girl cause ya miss this,
That's what I heard
That's what I heard
That's what I heard
Word girl
(tonight)
