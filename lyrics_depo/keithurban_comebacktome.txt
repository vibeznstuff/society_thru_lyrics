If there's sand that you ain't wrote your name in
If you're tired of the view from the same window
If there's lips that you wanna be drunk on
Ferris wheels that you need to get stuck on, go...
See everything you think you need to see,
then come back to me

If there's pavement you ain't put your shoes on
If there's dance floors you ain't made a move on yet
And if you're feelin' too safe here beside me
And you wanna do something you might regret
Try the whole world on if you feel the need,
Then come back to me

I wouldn't want you to miss a thing
I wouldn't wake you from any dream you ever have
So go on and go unroll every map
If you gotta leave, you gotta know
I love you enough to let you go
And if there's greener grass
Hey I wanna hold ya, but I don't want to hold you back

If you fly like a bird in the jet stream,
hope the sky is in Hollywood-set-scene blue.
And if you land with a tan and your shades on
Hope the promise the postcard made comes true
But if ain't all that you dreamed it'd be...
Come back to me

I wouldn't want you to miss a thing
I wouldn't wake you from any dream you ever have
So go on and go unroll every map
If you gotta leave, you gotta know
I love you enough to let you go
And if there's greener grass
Hey I wanna hold ya, but I don't want to hold you back

If you find someone else who deserves you
Hope he loves you enough not to hurt you
But if he does you know right where I'll be...
Come back to me
