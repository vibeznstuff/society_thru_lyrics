I see you walking with her
I see you all around
But you don't seem very happy now
You seem very down
I know you feel an obligation
To her emotional state of mind
But this is the time of your life baby
And you should be having a good time

And if you want me I'll be there
To run my fingers through your hair
If you need me it's alright
Come on over baby, and see me tonight (you've got to)
Live your life be free
Live your life be free
Open up your mind and you will see
You should be with me

You know that I'll be waiting
You know my heart is true
I will be your everything
And give everything to you
So is you want me baby, I'm yours
You don't have to knock, kick down my doors
Rules are made to be broken every day
You got one life to live, so hey (why don't you)
Live your life be free
Live your life be free
Open up your heart and you will see
You should be with me, baby
You should be with me

Live your life be free
Live your life be free
And when you free you mind
You will leave your past behind
Live your life be free
Live your life be free
Open up your eyes and you will see
You should be with me, baby
You should be with me
Live your life be free
Live your life be free
Open up your heart and you will see
You should be with me baby
You should be with me
