(I will be gone before you wake
I will be gone before oh yes
I will be gone before you wake
I will be gone)

Yeah, carry on whinging and whining
And get left to regret what you said
I'll be out the door in a sec
Like Usain Bolt, I'm quicker than lightening
I'm tired of irony
And hours on end, the bickering, fighting
I blame my surroundings
A relationship defined in violence
It blossomed, then it bloomed
Now it's rotten and I'm blue
And even though I still love you
I can't go through with the doom and gloom again
That's the truth my friend
I'm not leaving for another lady
I felt I had to depart
'Cause if I didn't I'd kill you, maybe


Oh, everything fades away
The sun don't always glow
You can't go against the grain
You gotta let it go, let it go
Oh, everything fades away
The sun don't always glow, no, no
You gotta let it go, let it go
I just wanna be left alone,
It's time to let it go
I just wanna be left alone
I think it's time you let it go

The sun doesn't always shine
I'm stuck in a solar eclipse
Even though I love you to bits
I'm done with the pain that we both inflict
Upon one another
It don't make me happy to watch you suffer
Run back to your mother
Tell her I turned out the same as the others
I don't know how to handle ya
All you do is make me angrier
'Til I wanna manhandle ya
I'm contemplating whether to kiss ya or strangle ya
But I can't put my hands on ya
Like a burning flame and I'll burn in flames
In hell if I did, so I'm walking away
I can no longer stand with ya


I wanna be in the right bed
I wanna be in the right bed
I wanna be in the right bed
I wanna be in the...



You took me high you took me low
You sold your soul with lies you told
And now it's time to ride alone
The lights will guide me home
The more I gave, the more you take
Now I'll be gone before you wake
'Cause I just can't ignore my faith
Forget the day you saw my face

(I will be gone)
In the blink of an eye
(I will be gone)
With the stars in the sky
(I will be gone)
And you're asking me why
(I will be gone before you)
