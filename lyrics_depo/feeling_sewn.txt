Give me the song and I'll sing it like I mean it
Give me the words and I'll say them like i mean it

Cos you got my heart in a headlock
You stopped the blood and made my head soft
And god knows
You got me sewn

Nah nah nah etc.

Danny boy, don't be afraid, to shake that ass, and misbehave
Danny boy, I now you got time, but what are you waiting for,
Anyway the dust may just blow away, if you wait for a windy day

But you may find the chance has past you by;

I can't do the walk
I can't do the talk
I can't be your friend
Unless I pretend

So give me the song and I'll sing it like I mean it
So give me the words and I'll say them like I mean it

Cos you got my heart in a headlock
You stopped the blood and made my head soft
And god knows
You got me sewn

Nah nah nah etc.

Danny boy, don't be a fool
Take upon to break a rule
Danny boy your looking so low
You looking like the dead grown old
Anyway the blues just may wash away, if you wait for a rainy day
But you may find, the chance has past you by

I can't do the walk
I can't do the talk
I can't be your friend
Unless I pretend

So give me the song and I'll sing it like I mean it
So give me the words and I'll say them like I mean it

Cos you got my heart in a headlock
You stopped the blood and made my head soft
Cos you got my heart in a headlock
You stopped the blood and made my head soft
Made my head soft
Made my head soft
Made my head soft
Made my head soft
Yeah, yeah, yeah
