Last night I needed you so bad
I was alone and feeling sad
But now that I recall
You left me after all
The only girl I've ever had

I never ever made you cry
No, no I didn't even try
You promised you'd be true
You said you loved me too
My only girl told me a lie

And maybe there'll come a day
When I can smile and say
She used to be my girl

But now there's nothing left to say
She only wanted me for play
I learned my lesson fast
But now I know at last
That girl belongs to yesterday

My only girl
My only girl
I learned my lesson fast
But now I know at last
That girl belongs to yesterday
That girl she belongs to yesterday
