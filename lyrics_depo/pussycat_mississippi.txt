Well you can hear the country song from far, 
And someone plays the honky tonky guitar,
Where all the lights will go on one by one, 
People enjoying the sun, 
And the wind takes it  away, 
Where the Mississippi rolls down to the sea,
And lovers found the place they like to be, 
How many times before this song was ending, 
Love and understanding everywhere around. 

Mississippi, I'll remember you, 
Whenever I shall go away, 
I'll be longing for the day, 
When I will be in Greensville again, 
Mississippi you'll be on my  mind, 
Everytime I hear this song, 
Mississippi rolls along until the end of time.

Now the country song forever lost it's soul, 
When the guitar player turns to rock'n'roll, 
And everytime when summer nights are falling, 
I always will be calling, 
Dreams of yesterday.

Mississippi, I'll remember you, 
Whenever I shall go away, 
I'll be longing for the day, 
When I will be in Greensville again, 
Mississippi you'll be on my mind, 
Everytime I hear this song,
Mississippi rolls along until the end of time.

Everytime I hear this song,
Mississippi rolls along until the end of time.
