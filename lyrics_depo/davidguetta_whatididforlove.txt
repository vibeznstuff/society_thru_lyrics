Talking loud, talking crazy
Locked me outside
Prayin' for the rain to come
Bone dry again
Guess it's true what they say
I'm always late
Say you need a little space
That I'm in your way

It hurts, but I remember every scar
And I've learned
But living is the hardest part

I can't believe what I did for love
I can't believe what I did for us
Crash and we burn into flames
Stitch myself up and I'd do it again
I can't believe what I did for love

(What I did for love)
What I did for love
(What I did for love)
What I did for us
(What I did for love)
What I did for love
(What I did for love)
What I did for us

I'm a fool for your games
But I always play
Can't admit it was a waste
There's too much at stake

It hurts,
But I remember every scar
And I've learned
But living is the hardest part

I can't believe what I did for love
I can't believe what I did for us
Crash and we burn into flames
Stitch myself up and I do it again
I can't believe what I did for love

(What I did for love)
What I did for love
(What I did for love)
What I did for us
(What I did for love)
What I did for love
(What I did for love)

I can't believe what I did for love
