Drag myself from my bed
Around twenty past six
Get my kids up, make breakfast
One egg, two toast, three Weetabix

And as I sit down I look up
And you're standing in the doorway, sun at your back
In my old brown dressing gown
Well, no one can love you more than I love you now

But I gotta go, running for the bus
Coat flying and I try not to miss it this time
But the drivers waiting and that's strange
Kids on the top deck, quiet for a change

And there's no rain and no roadworks
In the bus lane and all my hurts run away
And I'm smiling as I'm punching in

The day I died was the best day of my life
The day I died was the best day of my life
Tell my friends and my kids and my wife
Everything will be alright
The day I died was the best day of my life

The secretaries they got a smile for me
And the in tray on my desks almost empty
I get a memo from executive Joe
Saying Rob the gob is getting kicked out
For embezzling funds from the company account

And I'd be lying if I said I wasn't chuffed
'Cause I always hated Rob
And now they'll probably offer me Robs old job

And in the park at lunch
There's no whinos on my favorite bench
None of that drunk chatter, none of that pissy stench
And the scrawny little pigeons with the gammy legs
Decide to dive bomb from someone else's sandwich instead

And there's something about the city today
Like all the colors conspire to overwhelm the gray
And this close to the fire I can feel no cold
But a rainbow halo around my soul

The day I died was the best day of my life
The day I died was the best day of my life
Tell my friends and my kids and my wife
Everything will be alright
The day I died was the best day of my life

So I leave work, get to the high street and I miss my bus
Should I wait for another? No I can't be arsed, I begin to walk
And rush hour crowd seem to part like the red sea
And I'm stopping at the offy

Twenty cigarettes and a six pack to relax me
And as I cross back over the street
I guess I never saw that taxi

The day I died was the best day of my life
The day I died was the best day of my life
Tell my friends and my kids and my wife
Everything will be alright
The day I died was the best day of my life
