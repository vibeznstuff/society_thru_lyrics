As the night comes down
Darkness slowly descends
I am lost and alone again
Now that you've gone

As the shadows fall
There's no place to hide
From the pain I feel inside
Now that you've gone
Every thought of you, every memory
Is a ghost that is hauting me
Now that you've gone

Now that you've gone
How can I go on?
I can't believe, this could happen to me
Now that you've gone
I've got to find a way
I need to know life goes on
Now that you've gone

There's a heavy cloud
Hanging over me
It's part of the legacy
Now that you've gone
Everything I do
Seems to make no sense
And I'm losing all my confidence
Now that you've gone

Now that you've gone
How can I go on
I can't believe, this could happen to me
Now that you've gone
I've got to find a way
I need to know life goes on
Now that you've gone

I'm just a shadow of the man I used to be
Before you turned me inside out
Your love was all that ever meant
a thing to me
It's something I can't live without

No, No
Now that you've gone
Losing my way
Don't let me see
Now that you've gone

Now that you've gone
How can I go on?
I can't believe, this could happen to me
Now that you've gone
I've got to find a way
I can't believe, this could happen to me
Now that you've gone
I've got to find a way
I need to know life goes on
Now that you've gone

Oh, Oh
Now that you've gone
Can't get away
Oh, Baby
Now that you've gone
I've got to find a way
Baby
Now that you've gone
To letting it go
Baby I need to know
Now that you've gone
Cos I need to know
Letting me go
Now that you've gone
No matter baby
