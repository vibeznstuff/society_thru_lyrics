Mom and dad told me
When you were on the way
They wouldn't love me any less
Well I didn't believe them
I thought you'd take my place
I didn't know a best friend is what I'd get

Through the years I'd make mistakes
So you wouldn't have to make 'em
I took chances every day
So you'd know when to take 'em

You can follow my footprints
But you don't have to fill my shoes
It's just a path for you to follow if you so choose
You can take the road less traveled
Yeah, I'd probably do that too
But if you're lost and feeling broken through and through
You can follow the footprints I left for you

I know it wasn't easy
Learning how to share
But now we get to share the memories
And all the times we argued
Swore we'd never speak again
Know deep down that I loved you even then

Through the years I'd make mistakes
So you wouldn't have to make 'em
I took chances every day
So you'd know when to take 'em

You can follow my footprints
But you don't have to fill my shoes
It's just a path for you to follow if you so choose
You can take the road less traveled
Yeah, I'd probably do that too
But if you're lost and feeling broken through and through
You can follow the footprints I left for you

And if one day you run right past me
Chasing down your dreams
I hope that I can look ahead
And you'd turn and say to me

You can follow my footprints
But you don't have to fill my shoes
It's just a path for you to follow if you so choose
You can take the road less traveled
Yeah, I'd probably do that too
But if you're lost and feeling broken, down and bruised
You can follow the footprints
I left for you
You can follow my footprints
I left for you
