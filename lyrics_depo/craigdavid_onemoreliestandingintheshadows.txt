Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartache to come
(can't you see me)
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartache to come


Promise me, I wouldn't cry
When the time came girl to say goodbye
I always knew that one day we would part
I always knew that you'd break my heart
But that was a chance I had to take
And even though I knew that it would cause me pain
Just one look and I lost my way
And if you'd ask I'd do the same again


Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartache to come
(can't you see me)
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartache to come
(can't you see me)


Some things in life are too good to resist
Opportunities that shouldn't be missed
From the first time that I laid my eyes on you
I knew right then I couldn't stop even if I wanted to
Cause somehow you got under my skin
My heart was locked but nothing stopped you breaking in
And even now I know that we're through
Over and over I just wanna kiss you


Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartache to come
(can't you see me)
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartache to come
(can't you see me)


I'm just a man with a hole in my life
No stars are dancing in my sky tonight
Baby I need you to make this thing right
I can't be alone no one more lie


Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartache to come
(can't you see me)
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartache to come
