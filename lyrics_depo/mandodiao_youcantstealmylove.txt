I was walking down the street 
with my chains chains chains 
tied up to my feet 
I leaned instead of jiggie 
with the sidewalk 
Now this street tells the same old boring tale 
that has failed in so many ways of life 
To trust its stories 
you've got to be dull as them 

And all the love I've got in here 
You've just killed you peasants 
didn't even care 
The love I had in store you raped for more 
And all the dreams I had in here 
you've just stolen 
You peasants didn't even care 
But the dreams I had for her you cannot touch, 
my golden hand 
'Cause it's guarded by your promises 
yeah, yeah, yeah!!! 

I met her in a crowded room 
where the bookshelves help you and knowledge takes your hand 
I watched her beauty from an armchair 
I said "Hey girl have you seen that film 
with those kids in New York in the eighties 
Oh, you have - Well, can I watch it with you anyway" 

And all the love I've got in here 
You've just killed you peasants 
didn't even care 
The love I had in store you raped for more 
And all the dreams I had in here 
you've just stolen 
You peasants didn't even care 
But the dreams I had for her you cannot touch, 
my golden hand 
'Cause it's guarded by your promises 
yeah, yeah yeah, yeah!!! 

Congratulation Mr. Major 
you savior, 
betrayer, 
you stinking master of trusts 
How does it feel to ride all those horses 
You cannot touch our hearts 
when we're in bloom 
I assume that we'll win over the heads again 
We conceal non, 
you'll feel none, 
that's what I promise 

And all the love we've got in store, 
you can't kill You peasants! 
We won it all 
And the love I have for her 
you cannot touch, 
my golden hand, 
'Cause it's guarded by your filthy promises 

And all the love I've got in here 
You've just killed you peasants 
didn't even care 
The love I had in store you raped for more 
And all the dreams I had in here 
you've just stolen 
You peasants didn't even care 
But the dreams I had for her you cannot touch, 
my golden hand 
'Cause it's guarded by your promises 
yeah, yeah, yeah!!! 

Honey I love you, like the summer falls
And the winter crawls you're above and beyond me 
Honey I love you, like the summer falls
And the winter crawls you're above and beyond me 

Honey I love you, like the summer falls
And the winter crawls you're above and beyond me
