Love is a road
Forever winding
Where it leads us I don't know
In it together
For better or worse
Searchin' for our pot of gold

Time leaves a trail of broken hearts
So many arrows just keep missing
Their mark - but baby that ain't us

Nothin' else matters if you're in it for love
Together we can only go higher
We can reach any rainbow that we're
Dreamin' of
Nothin' else matters at all
When you're in it for love

We'll share in the laughter
We'll share in the tears
In the promises we keep
Life can be crazy

Love can be cruel
But it's always been a two way street
You try to give it all you have to give
So many people don't know how to forgive
But baby that ain't us

Nothin' else matters if you're in it for love
Together we can only go higher
We can reach any rainbow that we're
Dreamin' of
Nothin' else matters at all
When you're in it for love
