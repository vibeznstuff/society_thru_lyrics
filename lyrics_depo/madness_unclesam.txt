Here they come again
Hop scotching up to my door
One by one again
Knockety knock knocking upon my floor

Swinging on my gate
They gain entry by the yard
Pulling at my hair they scream
Paint your thoughts upon my card

But not tonight I've got studies to examine
Tomorrow I'll be watching all the Queen's men
A talent contest on Monday with my Uncle Sam
Who now takes up all my time he gives me things to do
'cause he's a wonderful man

But I'm sailing across the sea
To see my Uncle Sam
I'm sailing across the sea
To be with my Uncle Sam
To be with my Uncle Sam

Silly little sniggers from the women liberators
But I'll stand and hold my post
Polished buttons and erect I'll raise the flag
I'll show those women who's the most

But not tonight I've got studies to examine
Tomorrow I'll be watching all the Queen's men
A talent contest on Monday with my Uncle Sam
Who now takes up all of my time,
Gives me things to do he's a wonderful man

But I'm sailing across the sea to see my Uncle Sam
I'm sailing across the sea to be with my Uncle Sam
Sailing across the sea to see my Uncle Sam
I'm sailing across the sea to be with my Uncle Sam

But not tonight I've got studies to examine
Tomorrow ha ha ha
Tomorrow I'll be watching all the Queen's men
A talent contest on Monday with my Uncle Sam
Who now takes up all of my time,
He gives me things to do he's a wonderful man

Sailing across the sea to see my Uncle Sam
I'm sailing across the sea to be with my Uncle Sam
