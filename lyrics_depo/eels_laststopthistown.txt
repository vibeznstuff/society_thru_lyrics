You're dead but the world keeps spinning
Take a spin through the world you left
It's getting dark a little too early
Are you missing the dearly bereft?

Taking flight and you could be
Here tomorrow
Taking flight, well, you could get
Here tonight

I'm gonna fly on down for the 
Last stop to this town
What?
I'm gonna fly on down then fly away
Well, alright

Get down

Taking a spin through the neighborhood
The neighbors scream
Whatchya talkin' bout?
'cause they don't know how to
Let you in
And i can't let you out

What if i was not your only friend
In this world
Can you take me where you're going
If you're never coming back

I'm gonna fly on down for the 
Last stop to this town
I'm gonna fly on down 
Then fly away on my way

Get down

Why don't we take a ride 
Away up high
Through the neighborhood
Up over the billboards and the factories
And smoke

I'm gonna fly on down for the 
Last stop to this town
Yeah
I'm gonna fly on down
Then fly away on my way
Fly away

Get down
