Come on, come on,
I'm right, I'm wrong and when I'm wrong I say.
We always had the good and bad
And that will never change.
This is the closest, I've ever been
Oh yeah.

We give, we take
We mend, we break
And so the cycle goes,
We're doing well, we've been through hell,
And only heaven knows,
How far we get to,
Thank God I met you though,
And if you don't know.

Just put your hand on my heart,
Put your hand on my heart,
And I don't have to say it,
And I don't have to think it,
Just put your hand on my heart
Just put your hand on my heart.
You'd know.

Come on, come on
'Cause you're the one that I want for myself
The strength you give I wanna live,
Inside our little shell.
Nothing comes close to,
Nothing's supposed to yeah.

You have your doubts the same way I do,
When your wrapped safe in my love that's the truth.

Just put your hand on my heart,
Put your hand on my heart,
And I don't have to say it,
And I don't have to think it,
Just put your hand on my heart
Just put your hand on my heart.
You'd know.

When you don't feel that you're strong enough to make it,
When life treats you hard and don't think you can take it,
When you don't know where you stand you're close to breaking,
Just put your hand on my heart,
Put your hand on my heart

Just put your hand on my heart,
Put your hand on my heart,
And I don't have to say it,
And I don't have to think it,
Just put your hand on my heart
Just put your hand on my heart.
You'd know.

Just put your hand on my heart,
Put your hand on my heart,
And I don't have to say it,
And I don't have to think it,
Just put your hand on my heart
Just put your hand on my heart.
You'd know.
