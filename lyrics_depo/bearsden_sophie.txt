You were kind and welcoming
On the slopes of La Bartolina
You can take all of your love out on me
Sophie

You always loved Charlie best
You never knew how each night I wept
But I'll feast upon the crumbs he's left
Sophie

And I can't forgive myself
Oh, I can't forgive myself

You would hide yourself in a shrug
As your hair starting falling out
When you took off your dressing gown
Sophie

Your mother was dressed in black
With a lock of your hair in her hands
And I knew there was no turning back
Sophie

And I can't forgive myself
No, I can't forgive myself
I can't forgive myself
No, I can't forgive myself
Sophie
Sophie

Didn't know when I started running
I was running for my life
Didn't know when I started running
I'd be running my whole life
Didn't know when I started running
I was running for my life
Didn't know when I started running
I'd be running my whole life
I didn't know when I started running
I was running for my life
I didn't know when I started running
I'd be running my whole life
