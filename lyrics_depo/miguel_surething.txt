Love you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover


You could bet that
Never gotta sweat that

If you be the cash
I'll be the rubber band
You be the match
Imma be your fuse
Boom!
Painter, baby, you
Could be the muse
I'm the reporter, baby
You could be the news
'Cause you're the cigarette
And I'm the smoker
We raise a bet...
'Cause you're the joker
Chipped off
You are the chalk
And I could be the blackboard
And you can be the talk
And I could be the walk

Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire, baby
Even when it's do or die
We can do it, baby, simple and plain

'Cause this love is a sure thing

You could bet that
Never got to sweat that 

You could be the lover
I'll be the fighter babe
If I'm the blunt
You could be the lighter babe
Fire it up!
Writer, baby
You could be the quote
If I'm the lyric, baby
You could be the note
Record that!
Saint, I'm a sinner
Prize, I'm a winner
And it's you
What can I do to deserve that
Paper, baby
I'll be the pen
Say that I'm the one
'Cause you are a ten
Real and not pretend!

Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire, baby
Even when it's do or die
We can do it babe simple and plain
'Cause this love is a sure thing


Rock with me, baby
Let me hold you in my arms
Talk with me, baby

This love
Between you and I
As simple as pie, baby
Such a sure thing
Oh is it a sure thing 

Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire, baby
Even when it's do or die
We can do it, baby, simple and plain
This love is a sure thing
Love you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover
