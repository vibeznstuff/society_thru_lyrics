Sitting in today, watching traffic buzzing by, and faces nosing in
A victim of regret, it glitters and it fades away, like silver turning grey
Washed it all away, waiting for this dream to end, before it sucks me in

I'm climbing high, up above the streets and rows of neon lights
I'm holding out my hand but I'm alone
Wish I could show you
Wish you could see through my eyes
Tomorrow shines through
But I'm missing yesterday

Crashing on the ground, the silence seems to suffocate, and bury me again
Waiting for a taste, of happiness to lift me free, and carry me away

I'm climbing high, up above the streets and rows of neon lights
I know it's just a dream but I'm alive
Wish I could show you
Wish you could see through my eyes
Tomorrow shines through
But I'm missing yesterday
I'm still missing yesterday
I'll wait, I'll wait for you tonight.

Lost another week, feeling like a leper in, a world of vanity
It's killing me today, addiction pulls you down, you know
And she's the drug I need

Wish I could show you
Wish you could see through my eyes
Tomorrow shines through
But I'm missing yesterday
Wish I could show you
Wish you could see through my eyes
Tomorrow shines through
But I'm missing yesterday.
