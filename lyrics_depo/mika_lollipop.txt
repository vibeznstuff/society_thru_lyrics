What's the big idea?
Yo, Mika!
I said sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, loves gonna get you down
I said sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, loves gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Loves gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Loves gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Loves gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Loves gonna get you down.

I went walking with my momma one day
When she warned me what people say
Live your life until love is found
'Cause loves gonna get you down.
Take a look at the girl next door
She's a player and a downright bore
Jesus loves her but she wants more
Oh, bad girls get you down.

Sing it!
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, loves gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, loves gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Oh, loves gonna get you down.
Say love, say love
Oh, loves gonna get you down.

Mama told me what I should know
Too much candy gonna rot your soul
If she loves you let her go
'Cause love only gets you down.
Take a look at a boy like me
Never stood on my own two feet
Now I'm blue as I can be
Oh, love only got me down.

Sing it!
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, loves gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, loves gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Oh loves gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Oh loves gonna get you down.

I was walking with my momma one day
When she warned me what people say
Live your life until love is found
Or loves gonna get you down.

Sing it!
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Loves gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, loves gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Oh, loves gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Oh, loves gonna get you down.

Mama told me what I should know
Too much candy gonna rot your soul
If she loves you let her go
'Cause love only gets you down.

Waa-oh waa-oh waa-oh lollipop
Waa-oh waa-oh waa-oh lollipop
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
oh loves gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
oh loves gonna get you down
