Damn
The Doctors's just
Finished telling me
There's No Time

Losing you could be the
End of me and that
I should do the things
That I wanna do, how could I

Without you 
Without you
ooh, ooh

Cause you're the only 
One I let in
Tell me how to stop 
This feeling

Spreading
I'm hoping somehow
That you know
Ooh, ohh

Let's just get back together
We should have never broke up
They're telling me
That my heart wont beat again

We should've stayed together
Cause when you left me it stopped
They're telling me 
My heart wont beat again

Won't beat again
It's killing me
Hey, hey, hey

If I died 
Yeah would you come
To my funeral
Would you cry

Would you feel some regret
That we didn't try
Or would you fall apart
The same as I, I, I, I

Oh and would it always 
Haunt you baby?
That you missed your chance
To save me

Cause you know it's not
To late
Hey, hey, hey

Let's just get back together
We should have never broke up
They're telling me
That my heart wont beat again

We should've stayed together
Cause when you left me it stopped
They're telling me 
My heart wont beat again

Won't beat again
Won't beat again

Hey I need you 
Back in my arms
I need love CPR

Cause it's gettin 
So cold ooh,
I need you back again
Or else I'll never mend

And girl if go
I go, I go, I go

Let's just get back together
We should have never broke up
They're telling me
That my heart wont beat again

We should've stayed together
Cause when you left me it stopped
They're telling me 
My heart wont beat again

Won't beat again
Won't beat again
It's killing me
