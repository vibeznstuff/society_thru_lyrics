Someday I'm coming back, and it won't be long
Before you call me and tell me to come home
Someday I'm coming back, and it won't be long
Before I'm home, home and in your arms

What did I do my darling? That made you send me running
Told you to cast me down and throw me out
What can I tell you honey, if I don't know what I've done
All I can hope is that you ask me to come back home

Someday I'm coming back, and it won't be long
Before you call me and tell me to come home
Someday I'm coming back, and it won't be long
Before I'm home, home and in your arms

Even in stormy weather, we always stick together
You always kept me near, we're so sincere
So why so sudden the change of heart
Why do I feel like I've done wrong?
When all that I want is that you ask me to come back home

Someday I'm coming back, and it won't be long
Before you call me and tell me to come home
Someday I'm coming back, and it won't be long
Before I'm home, home and in your arms

Someday, someway (I never wanted anyone so much)
Someday, someway

What did I do my darling? That made you send me running
Told you to cast me down and throw me out
What can I tell you honey, if I don't know what I've done
All I can hope is that you ask me to come back home

So why so sudden the change of heart
Why do I feel like I've done wrong?
When all that I want is that you ask me to come back home

Someday I'm coming back, and it won't be long
Before you call me and tell me to come home
Someday I'm coming back, and it won't be long
Before I'm home, home and in your arms
