Let me down slow and easy 
Cause there ain't nothin' I can do 
I hope and pray my faith won't leave me 
When it comes down to me and you 

Try a little tenderness 
I die a little 
For a long lost sweet caress 

You lyin' next to me 
Fulfilled some destiny 
I wanna cry 
But I breathe a sigh 

Just a little bit of letting go 
I don't want you to know 
I wanna cry 
But I breathe a sigh 

Overflow of emotion 
And a hurt that'll never heal 
If you close the door forever 
The fate of pain is sealed 

Try a little tenderness 
I die a little 
For a long lost sweet caress 



 

I more than long for your affection 
I tell you know that ain't so 
Not even gentle persuasion 
Is ever gonna let me go 
Won't you let me breathe
