This old heart of mine been broke a thousand times.
Each time you break away, feel you're gone to stay.
Lonely nights that come, memories that go,
bringing you back again, hurting me more and more.
Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside,
'cause each day that passes by
you got me never knowing if I'm coming or going
but I love you, yes I do.
I love you; this old heart weeps for you.

I try hard to hide my hurt inside.
This old heart of mine always keeps me crying.
The way you treat me leaves me incomplete.
You're here for the day, gone for the week.
But if I want you a hundred times,
a hundred times I have you back.
I'm yours whenever you want me;
I wanna shout about it, tell the world about it
'cause I love you; this old heart weeps for you.
I love you, yes, I do.

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside,
'cause each day that passes by
you got me never knowing if I'm coming or going
but I love you, yes I do.
This old heart weeps for you.
I love you; this old heart weeps for you.
I love you; yes I do.
I love you; this old heart weeps for you.
