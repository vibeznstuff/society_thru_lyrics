Why, the lights on
You said, said you were out
You did gone
Yeah you left, but now
I'm on your lawn, I could tell that
There was something wrong
What's goin' on?
Saw a silhouette, oh no no,
I smell a cigarette â€“ you don't smoke
Well, well, I guess you're home
You dead gone
Now you gon' get it out

Get get get get it get it

Now you flip the switch
You gon' wish you never did this
I'ma flip the script
Put you, put you on my hit list
Who you think this is
You know I'm about my business
What you think this is
You know I'm about my business

You don't know me
Boy you can't run away
Oh please, gon' find you anyway
I'ma lick ya lick ya down
Lick ya lick ya down down
Lick ya lick ya down
Lick ya lick ya down down


Now I'm your ex
I'ma put you on blast on the internet
No regrets, no doubt, I'm over it
But before I'm out I'ma make you sweat
(Mek-mek yuh sweat, sweat)

Now you flip the switch
You gon' wish you never did this
I'ma flip the script
Put you, put you on my hit list
Who you think this is
You know I'm about my business
What you think this is
You know I'm about my business

You don't know me
Boy you can't run away
Oh please, gon' find you anyway
I'ma lick ya lick ya down
Lick ya lick ya down down
Lick ya lick ya down
Lick ya lick ya down down


Girl now I know I did you wrong
Now I know I did you wrong
Played you like a fool
Please don't hold a grudge this long
When you gon' be cool
They all know I want you back
Feeling like a fool
When can we be cool?
Cause I'm feeling like a fool


Cha Dread, Cha Dread
Cha Dread, Cha Dread

You don't know me
Boy you can't run away
Oh please, gon' find you anyway
I'ma lick ya lick ya down
Lick ya lick ya down down
Lick ya lick ya down
Lick ya lick ya down down
