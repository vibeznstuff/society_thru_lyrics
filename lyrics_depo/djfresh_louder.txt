I can't control this feeling
something's happening inside me
our senses come alive
the chemistry is building
it's something that we're feeling
there's nowhere you can hide

It's gonna get louder

We're gonna get stronger

We're gonna feel better

You can't tame this energy inside

I gotta reach higher

I wanna burn like a fire

Gotta move faster

You can't tame this energy inside

perpetual emotion
it's just a ripple in the ocean
a shadow in the night
changes we're making for the better
we're going through together
there's nowhere you can hide

it's more than a feeling
we're building a dream that we've always had clear in our sights
watch it ignite as we open our eye
it's the one way we know to survive
we're powerfully changing the world
we're reclaiming our unity
they can't divide
they push us around
but we're tearing it down
and we're having the time of our life

It's gonna get louder

We're gonna get stronger

We're gonna feel better

You can't tame this energy inside

I gotta reach higher

I wanna burn like a fire

Gotta move faster

You can't tame this energy inside

faster 

louder

stronger

better

faster

louder

better

you can't tame this energy inside
