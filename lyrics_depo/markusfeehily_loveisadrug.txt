I'm lying in the gutter looking up at the stars
I can't keep running it's catching up on me now
It makes me wonder if I'mma ever get out
Yeah I'm so thrown that there's no saving me now

And I feel such a fool, depending on you
And I wanna scream 'somebody let me out!'

It's like I'm dying in a dream, and I'm tryna wake up
Crawling on my knees and I cannot get up
Wish I woulda known when enough was enough
Need something for the pain, but the killer is us
And it keeps on pulling me when I wanna get out
Ya keep on kicking me while you're holding me down
Yeah your love is a drug (Yeah, yeah)
Your love is a drug (Yeah, yeah)

I'm lying in your bed looking up at the stars
Ya got no mercy yeah and you're holding my heart
I try to erase you but you make it so hard
Yeah I would try anything just to tear us apart

And I feel such a fool, depending on you
And I wanna scream 'somebody let me out!'

It's like I'm dying in a dream, and I'm tryna wake up
Crawling on my knees and I cannot get up
Wish I woulda known when enough was enough
Need something for the pain, but the killer is us
And it keeps on pulling me when I wanna get out
Ya keep on kicking me while you're holding me down
Yeah your love is a drug (Yeah, yeah)
Your love is a drug (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Your love can't beat the feeling, Your love I really need it
Your love, your love, your love, your love

It's like I'm dying in a dream, and I'm tryna wake up
Crawling on my knees and I cannot get up
Wish I woulda known when enough was enough
Need something for the pain, but the killer is us
And it keeps on pulling me when I wanna get out
Ya keep on kicking me while you're holding me down
Yeah your love is a drug (Yeah, yeah)
Your love is a drug (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah your love is a drug (Yeah, yeah)
Your love is a drug (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
