Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely,
I have nobody for my own.
I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely.
I have nobody for my own.
I'm so lonely.

Yo, this one here goes out to all my players out there, man, ya know,
That got that one good girl who's always been there, man, like took all the bullshit.
Then one day she can't take it no more and decide to leave.

I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side.
Coulda sworn I was dreaming, for her I was feening.
So I had to take a little ride.
Back tracking over these few years,
Tryna figure out what I do to make it go bad.
'Cause ever since my girl left me my whole life came crashing and...

I'm so lonely (so lonely),
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely),
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own, girl).
I'm so lonely (so lonely),
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely),
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own, girl).

Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right outta my life.
After all I put you through
You still stuck around and stayed by my side.
What really hurt me is I broke your heart.
Baby, you were a good girl and I had no right.
I really wanna make things right
'Cause without you in my life, girl,...

I'm so lonely (so lonely),
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely),
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own, girl).
I'm so lonely (so lonely),
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely),
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own, baby).

Been all about the world,
Ain't never met a girl
That can take the things that you been through.
Never thought the day would come
Where you would get up and run,
And I would be out chasing you.

'Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be,
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely.

So lonely (so lonely),
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely),
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own).
I'm so lonely (so lonely),
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely).
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own, girl).

Never thought that I'd be alone (be alone).
I didn't think you'd be gone this long (gone so long).
I just want you to call my phone.
So, stop playing, girl, and come on home (come on home).
Baby girl, I didn't mean to shout (no).
I want me and you to work it out (work it out).
I never wished I'd ever hurt my baby (hurt my baby).
And it's driving me crazy 'cause...

I'm so lonely (so lonely),
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely),
I have nobody (have nobody)
For my own (for my own).
I'm so lonely (so lonely),
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely),
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own, girl).

Lonely, so lonely,
So lonely (so lonely),
Mr. Lonely, so lonely,
So lonely, so lonely (so lonely),
So lonely, so lonely (so lonely),
Mr. Lonely.
