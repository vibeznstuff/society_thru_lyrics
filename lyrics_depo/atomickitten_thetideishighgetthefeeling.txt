The tide is high
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one

I'm not the kinda girl
Who gives up just like that *Oh no*

It's not the things you do
That tease and hurt me bad
But it's the way you do the things
You do to me
I'm not the kinda girl
Who gives up just like that
*Oh no*

The tide is high
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your #1
The tide is high
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your #1

#1
#1

Every girl wants
You to be her man
But I'll wait right here
'Til it's my turn
I'm not the kinda girl
Who gives up just like that
Oh no

The tide is high
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your #1
The tide is high
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your #1

#1
#1

Everytime that I get
the feeling
You give me something
to believe in
Everytime that I got
you near me
I know the way that
I want it to be
But you know that
I'm gonna take
my chance now
I'm gonna make
 it happen somehow
And you know I can
take the pressure
A moment's pain for
a lifetime pleasure

Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait right here
'Til it's my turn
I'm not the kinda girl

Oh no

The tide is high
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your #1
The tide is high
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your #1
