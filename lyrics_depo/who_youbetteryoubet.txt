You better you better you bet.

I call you on the telephone my voice too rough with cigarettes.
I sometimes thing I should just go home but I'm dealing with a memory
that never forgets
I love to hear you say my name especially when you say yes
I got your body right now on my mind and I drunk myself b-lind to the
sound of old T-Rex
To the sound of old T-Rex - who's next?



When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you say you better
You better you better you bet
You better bet your life
Or love will cut you like a knife

I want those feeble minded axes overthrown
I'm not into your passport picture I just like your nose
You welcome me with open arms and open legs
I know only fools have needs but this one never begs

I don't really mind how much you love me
A little is really alright
When you say come over and spend the night
Tonight



I lay on the bed with you
We could make some book of records
Your dog keeps licking my nose
And chewing up all those letters
Saying "you better"
You better bet your life

You better love me, all the time now
You better shove me back into line now
You better love me, all the time now
You better shove me back into line now.

I showed up late one night with a neon light for a visa
But knowing I'm so eager to fight can't make letting me in any easier
I know tha~t I been wearing crazy clothes and I look pretty crappy
Sometime
But my body feels so good and I still sing a razor line everytime.

And when it comes to all night living
I know what I'm giving
I've got it all down to a tee
And it's free.
