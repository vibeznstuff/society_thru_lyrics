Superstar tradesman
Stand at the bar
Get a trade son
You will go far
You have a house in the ferry
And a new guitar that's never been played before
And it never will
Never been played before
And it never will

The weather is sunny
You're locked inside
The weather is sunny
Oh yes
Ive tried and ive tried
To keep me sane to keep me sane
To keep me sane to keep me sane

I don't want money I want a thing called happiness
I don't want cash you know
I'd quite like memories
To keep us on track
Lets never look back
To keep us on track
Lets never look back

What would you do
If I asked you
What would you do
If I asked you
To sail away to see some sights
Sail away with me to see some sights
