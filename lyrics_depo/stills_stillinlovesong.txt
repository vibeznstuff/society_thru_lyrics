We were lovers, we were kissers
We were holders of hands; we were make-believers just losing time
You said you'd rather live in T.V. land and then say that you can but you don't
That's heartless and I will not cry

But I'm still in love
And I'm still in love... 

You're dreams of acting on screen. What do they mean?
You'll be dancing senseless in your bedroom and
You find yourself out of a job and before too long
You'll be selling lemonade to the overpaid

And I'm still in love... 

I remember it was summer; I was out of my head but you would
You're selfish and a waste of space

But I'm still in love
And I'm still in love...
