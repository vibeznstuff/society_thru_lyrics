This beat is smokin' like a joint
You oughta puff it 'cause we're gonna rough it up
Like you never ever had it done to ya before
Makin' the baseline run right through
Beware because we're comin' out to you
Live is what you receivin', your butt is ready
So we are achievin' the motive  to dance
Forgettin' the boys, leavin' out the romance
Posin' with your posse in a Buffalo Stance
Releasin' the juice that makes you feel dizzy
Now what you're waitin' for to get busy
Now is the chance, the chance that you're takin'
While listenin' to the music we're makin'
Over and on and on and on
Rockin' to the beat till the break of dawn
You gonna like it, boy, you gonna bite it
I'm on the M-I-C so don't fight it

Doo-doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo,  
Doo-doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo  doo
Well, what's goin' on, yeah
Doo-doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo doo,  
Doo-doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
What you're waitin' for

You've got to move that body, baby,  
Move that body, baby
Move that body next to me
You've got to move that body, baby,  
Move that body, baby
Move that body next to me,  
Next to me 'cause I want it

Hey baby, are you crazy
Never let the music make you feel lazy
Get on the dance floor, feelin' that backbeat
You never had it so good, you never had it so sweet
Raise your hands up in the air
Shake your derriere like you just don't care
Rockin', rollin', doin' it steady
I do believe y'all are ready to move that body
Move that body, baby
Move that body, baby
Move that body next to me
You've got to move that body, baby,  
Move that body, baby
Move that body next to me,  
Next to me 'cause I want it

Well, what's goin' on

You've got to move that body, baby,  
Move that body, baby
Move that body next to me
You've got to move that body, baby,  
Move that body, baby
Move that body next to me,  
Next to me 'cause I want it

Push your butt in, stick your butt out
Push your butt in, shake it all out
You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around
That's what it's all about, this one's for you
All the people in the party crew
Now get on up and do what you gotta do
'Cause it's the music we're makin'
Get on up 'cause it's here for the takin'
You want it and we got it
So let's get this party started
On the floor, ask for more
Doin' it all night and you know you just might
Take a bite and then another
You're jammin' so hard, word to the mother
Rockin', rollin', doin' it steady
I do believe y'all are ready to move something, yeah
I do believe y'all are ready to move something
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Doo-doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo,  
Doo-doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo  doo
