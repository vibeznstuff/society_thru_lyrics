Together we made it
We made it even though we had our backs
Up against the wall


See a nigga survived the worst
But my life is glorious (uh!)
But I know that I leaped every hurdle
And I'm so victorious (uh!)
Take a look I'm a symbol of greatness
Now call a nigga Morpheus (yeah)
As force securin' the win, but they
Believe I'm so notorious (yeah)
You know that I've been 'bout my bread
Even though we rappin' now (yes)
We used to live on the strip even though
A nigga higher level trappin' now (oh!)
Superseded everyone of my little struggles and (uh!)
So your head never ever been an option (trust)
A nigga paper long like rush hour traffic
And I'm about to take the hood shoppin' (get it!)


Together we made it (you see we did it niggas)
We made it even though we had our backs
Up against the wall (come on)
Forever we waited (ah hah)
And they told us we were never gonna
Get it But we took it on the road
(To the riches)
on the road
(To the ghetto)
on the road
(In the projects, to this bangin' instrumental)
on the road
(Rise with me)
on the road
(Come and get it)
on the road


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
When it all got started we were steadily
Just getting rejected
And it seemed like nothin' we could do
would ever get us respected
At best we were stressed at the worst
They probably said we're pathetic
Had all the pieces to that puzzle
Just the way to connect it
I was fighting through every rhyme
Tightening up every line
Never restin' the question if I
Was out of my mind
It finally came time to do it and let it die
So we put the chips on the table and
Told them to let it ride, sing it (yeah)


Together we made it (you see we did it niggas)
We made it even though we had our backs
Up against the wall (come on)
Forever we waited (ah hah)
And they told us we were never gonna
Get it But we took it on the road
(To the riches)
on the road
(To the ghetto)
on the road
(In the projects, to this bangin' instrumental)
on the road
(Rise with me)
on the road
(Come and get it)
on the road

Yeah, yeah, yeah, look

In case you misunderstand exactly what I'm buildin'
This shit that I can leave for
My children's (children's) children's (children)
Now on the wake up I smile, to see how far I've come (yeah)
Fighting for sales when I'm stripped
To negate the hustle from (yeah)
From nights in jail on a bench using my muscles son (yeah)
To countin' money like Dre and Jimmy and Russel was (yeah nigga)
But now I live when I dream, you see we finally did it (oh!)
Let's make a toast to the hustle
Regardless how you get it, sing it


Together we made it (you see we did it niggas)
We made it even though we had our backs
Up against the wall (come on)
Forever we waited (ah hah)
And they told us we were never gonna
Get it But we took it on the road
(To the riches)
on the road
(To the ghetto)
on the road
(In the projects, to this bangin' instrumental)
on the road
(Rise with me)
on the road
(Come and get it)
