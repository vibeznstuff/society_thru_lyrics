THERE'S A PALE MOON IN THE SKY
THE KIND YOU MAKE YOUR WISHES ON
LIKE THE LIGHT IN YOUR EYES
THE ONE I BUILD MY DREAMS UPON
IT'S NOT HERE ANY LONGER
SOMETHING HAPPENED SOMEWHERE AND WE BOTH KNOW WHY
BUT ME I'M GETTING STRONGER
WE MUST STOP PRETENDING
I CAN'T LIVE THIS LIE

I DON'T CARE WHO'S WRONG OR RIGHT
I DON'T REALLY WANNA FIGHT NO MORE
TOO MUCH TALKING BABE
LET'S SLEEP ON IT TONIGHT
I DON'T REALLY WANNA FIGHT NO MORE
THIS IS TIME FOR LETTING GO

I HEAR A WHISPER IN THE AIR
THAT SIMPLY DOESN'T BOTHER ME
BOY, CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I DON'T CARE
OR ARE YOU LOOKING RIGHT THROUGH ME
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT LATELY (SEEMS TO ME THAT LATELY)
YOU LOOK AT ME THE WRONG WAY AND I START TO CRY
COULD IT BE THAT MAYBE (COULD IT BE THAT MAYBE)
THIS CRAZY SITUATION IS THE REASON WHY

I DON'T CARE WHO'S WRONG OR RIGHT
I DON'T REALLY WANNA FIGHT NO MORE
TOO MUCH TALKING BABE
DON'T CARE NOW WHO'S TO BLAME
I DON'T REALLY WANNA FIGHT NO MORE
THIS IS TIME FOR LETTING GO

HANGING ON TO THE PAST
IT ONLY STANDS IN OUR WAY
WE HAVE TO GROW FOR OUR LOVE TO LAST
BUT WE JUST GREW APART

OH DON'T WANNA HURT NO MORE
BUT BABY DON'T YOU KNOW
NO, I DON'T WANNA HURT NO MORE...
TIRED OF ALL THESE GAMES
THIS TIME I'M WALKING BABE
