Thought I could leave you cause I felt my heart numbing
It hits so deep, I closed my eyes and I just took off running
I turned around and saw the look on your face
So I stayed, stayed

But I don't need you and you should know that, baby
It'd take a miracle for you to really try and change me
And I felt sorry for the look on your face
So I stayed, stayed

So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed

You wanna leave her, don't wanna hurt nobody
I don't believe a single word you say or that you're sorry
Why can't I say "No" to the look on your face?
I just stay, stay

So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed

You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay, yeah
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay

You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay, yeah
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay, yeah

But will you? Will you? Will you?

So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed

I stay, I stay
Oh why, do I stay?
So I stayed, stayed
