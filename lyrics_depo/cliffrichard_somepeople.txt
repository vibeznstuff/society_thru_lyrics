Some people they tease one another
Take pride in themselves
keeping the other one down
Well I'm not like that at all 

Some people they hurt one another
They love to see
Hurt in the other one's eyes
Well I'm not like that at all 

Some people are born for each other
They love to walk
Holding the other one's hand
They always understand
Some people cry
Some people know why 

Some people they use one another
So aimlessly
Not like lovers do
Well I'm not like that at all 

Some people they long for each other
The love to talk
Holding the other one's hand
They always understand
Some people cry
Some people know why 

With a word unspoken
With a voice unheard
When a thought is broken
By a tender word
When a heart is moved
When a hears is thrown
The silence tells you
You're not alone
