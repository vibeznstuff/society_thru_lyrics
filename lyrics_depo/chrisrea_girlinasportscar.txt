When I was a boy I had a dream
It never came true but somehow it seems
When I drift away and I knowing so
There's a certain time and a place I go

Every heart's got it's moment
Written on it's soul
Just a minute in it's lifetime
Of a happiness untold

For the smallest grain of sand in time
Your own shadow sets you free
And you turn to your reflection
And your heart cries out, is this really me?
It's the girl in the sports car 1961
And she's sitting in her Lusso
In the early morning sun

For the smallest grain of sand in time
Your own shadow sets you free
And you turn to your reflection
And your heart cries out is this really me?
It's the girl in the sports car 1961
And she's sitting in her Lusso
In the early morning sun
That girl in the sports car
That girl in the sports car
Girl in the sports car
That girl in the sports car
Girl in the sports car
That girl in the sports car
