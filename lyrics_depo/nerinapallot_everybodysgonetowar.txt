I've got a friend, he's a pure-bred killing machine
He says he's waited his whole damn life for this
I knew him well when he was seventeen
Now he's a man he'll be dead by Christmas

And so, everybody's going to war
But we don't know what we're fighting for
Don't tell me it's a worthy cause
No cause could be so worthy

If love is a drug, I guess we're all sober
If hope is a song, I guess it's all over
How to have faith, when faith is a crime?
I don't want to die
I'f God's on our side, then God is a joker
Asleep on the job, his children fall over
Running out through the door and straight to the sky
I don't want to die

For every man who wants to rule the world
There'll be a man who just wants to be free
What do we learn but what should not be learned?
Too late to find a cure for this disease

And so, everybody's going to war
But we don't know what we're fighting for
Don't tell me it's a worthy cause
No cause could be so worthy

If love is a drug, I guess we're all sober
If hope is a song, I guess it's all over
How to have faith, when faith is a crime?
I don't want to die
If God's on our side, then God is a joker
Asleep on the job, his children fall over
Running out through the door and straight to the sky
I don't want to die
I-I-I-I don't want to die
I-I don't want to die
