We strolled the lane together, laughed at the rain together
Sang love's refrain together and we'd both pretend it would never end
But one day we cried together, cast love aside together

You're gone from me but in my memory
We always will be together

Oh darlin', the memory of all the happy moments
We shared together will always remain in my heart
The picnics at the park, the boat rides on the lake

The way we danced all night, the warmth of your kiss
The way you held me tight are all part of a tender love
I'll never, never forget

You're gone from me but in my memory
Darlin', wherever you are
We'll always be together
