Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Oh shall I stay, would it be a sin
Oh if I can't help falling in love with you

Oh like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling so it goes some things are meant to be

Take my hand, take my whole life too
Oh for I can't help falling in love with you

Oh like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling so it goes some things are meant to be

Oh oo-ooh take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you
Oh oo-ooh for I, I can't help falling in love with you
