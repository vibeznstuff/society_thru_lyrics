When I first saw your face
Knew that I could not hesitate
You said, "Baby don't go too fast
If we do then it may not last"

Time went on and I waited for you
I didn't know what else I could do
(What else should I do)
I thought that we'd always be together
You said, "Hold on, it just gets better"

And I believed you
I kept holding on
You think that I can never leave you
You think I'm not that strong
You're wrong


Love won't wait (Love won't wait)
Forever and a day (Love won't wait)
Love must live in the here and now
Don't ask me how I know

So here I am with my heart on my sleeve
You said, "Baby put your trust in me"
But I have come to the end of the line
And you've wasted up all of my precious time

Wanted to be something special to you
Everybody's somebody's fool
(Won't be a fool)
No, you've got me all wrong
(You've got me all wrong)
You don't know what you have
Till it's gone

And I believed you
I kept holding on
You think that I can never leave you
You think I'm not that strong
You're wrong



Love takes time (Love takes time)
But you've been takin' too long
(Take too long)
Time never waited for anyone
Don't wait too long
Or I'll be gone
Don't Wait too long
I'll be gone
I'll be gone

(Or there) There wasn't anything
That I wouldn't do
(And you) You led me on
You even said, "I love you"
(I love you, baby)
How can we go on
When it's tearin' us apart
(How can we love)
Are you going to break my heart?
'Cause I believed you



Love takes time (Love takes time)
But you've been takin' too long
(Take too long)
Time never waited for anyone
Don't wait too long
Or I'll be gone
Don't Wait too long
I'll be gone
I'll be gone

Love takes time
Don't let this love just pass by us
It's not too late, you must choose
Love is so hard to find
And so easy to lose
