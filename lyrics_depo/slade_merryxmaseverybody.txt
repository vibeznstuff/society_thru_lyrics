Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
It's the time that every Santa has a ball
Does he ride a red-nosed reindeer?
Does it ton-up on his sleigh?
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?


So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
Are you sure you've got the room to spare inside?
Does your granny always tell you
That the old songs are the best?
Then she's up and rock 'n' rolling with the rest


So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

What will your daddy do
When he sees your momma kissing Santa Clause?
Aaah ah aaah aahh

Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
Do you ride on down the hillside
In a buggy you have made?
When you land upon your head
Then you've been "Slade" (slayed)


So here it is. Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
(It's Christmas!)
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
