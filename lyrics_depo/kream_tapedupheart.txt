There is no place I can hide
Cause wherever I go it's you I find
I got a can of bright blue pills
Supposed to get rid of them heavy feels, yeah

I bet that she's beautiful and there is no doubt
She's all that you wanted, the queen of the crowd
I bet your friends love her, cause she's always so fun, yeah
And the worst thing of all is I used to be that one

Now it's only just me and my sheets
Got your hands on me on repeat
All I wanna do is go to sleep
With my taped up heart and my open bottle
Me and my sheets
You should know that we're done with your shit
All I wanna do is go to sleep
With my taped up heart and my open bottle

Hold up

Now it's only just me and my sheets
Got your hands on me on repeat
All I wanna do is go to sleep
With my taped up heart and my open bottle
Me and my sheets
You should know that we're done with your shit
All I wanna do is go to sleep
With my taped up heart and my open bottle

When I fall, I fall deeper, yeah, I'm still falling
Can't get rid of the feeling, the feeling haunt me
So I fall, I fall deeper, deeper, deeper
So I fall, I fall deeper, deeper, deeper

Now it's only just me and my sheets
Got your hands on me on repeat
All I wanna do is go to sleep
With my taped up heart and my open bottle
Me and my sheets
You should know that we're done with your shit
All I wanna do is go to sleep
With my taped up heart and my open bottle

Hold up

Now it's only just me and my sheets
Got your hands on me on repeat
All I wanna do is go to sleep
With my taped up heart and my open bottle
Me and my sheets
You should know that we're done with your shit
All I wanna do is go to sleep
With my taped up heart and my open bottle
