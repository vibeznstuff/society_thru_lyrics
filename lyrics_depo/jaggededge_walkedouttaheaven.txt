I'm rolling down a lonely highway asking god to please forgive me for messing up the blessing he gave to me, I see,
Everything clearer now the nights is black as, black as its ever been
Without my girl, I'm gonna lose it, I pray that he would just shed his grace on me, I need just to be back with my baby


Feels like I just walked right out of heaven
Feels like I have damn near thrown my life away, hey yea yea
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do, get back right wit you
Feels like I just walked right out of heaven
Feels like I have damn near thrown my life away, hey yea yea
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do, Feels like I just walk right out of heaven


See my mama told me that's if its meant to be she'll come back and she'll forgive me and the best thing I can do it to just
Let her, let her go I know, I don't wanna do it
But if I continue to push she'll just pull away and I know that in my heart its a reality I didn't treat her like she wanted
To be treated, and I hope that shes not gone for good no no




Hey girl waiting for you all the time, suppose to move on with my life, and girl I tried and I tried
I feel like I can't walk, I feel like I can't talk girl I don't know what to do get back right with you I feel like I just
Walked outta heaven


If u ever loved somebody, and if you ever had somebody, but you know that you hurt that somebody, let me here you say yea
