Never thought that I would grow so old of seeing the gold
Still I never want it to go
I would hold it up to my cold heart
Feel the way it used to start up

Take me back, take, take
Take me back to the way that I was before
Hungry for what was to come
Now I'm longing for the way I was

You say you will, say you will save me
You say you will, say you will save me
You say you will, say you will save me
You say you will, say you will, oh-oh

Take me back
Give it up, give it up to me
Cause I can't go on
If your love isn't strong
See I wanna know
Give me, give me all your love
If you can't hold on
Then baby, baby don't save me now
(If your love isn't strong)
Baby, don't save me now
No, no

All my life I wasn't trying to get on a highway
I was wondering which way to go
Spending all of my damn time
Leaving all the weight behind you

Take me back, take take
Take me back to the song how it used to go oh-oh
Screaming for what was to come
Now I'm dreaming 'bout the way I was

You say you will, say you will save me
You say you will, say you will save me
You say you will, say you will save me
You say you will, say you will, oh-oh

Take me back
Give it up, give it up to me
Cause I can't go on
If your love isn't strong
See I wanna know
Give me, give me all your love
If you can't hold on
Then baby, baby don't save me now
(If your love isn't strong)
Baby, don't save me now
No, no

And if I have to beg for your love
(Again, and again and again)
Tell me, tell me
Oh, will it ever be enough?
(Again, and again and again)
Tell me, tell me
And if I have to beg for your love
(Again, and again and again)
Tell me, tell me
Oh, will it ever be enough?
(Again, and again and again)

So, baby don't save me
No, baby don't save me
Baby, don't save me now
(Again, and again and again)
(If your love isn't strong)
Baby, don't save me now
(Again, and again and again)
(If your love isn't strong)
Baby, don't save me now
(Again, and again and again)
(If your love isn't strong)
Baby, don't save me now
(Again, and again and again)
(If your love isn't strong)
Don't save me
(Again, and again and again)
Don't save me
(Again, and again and again)
