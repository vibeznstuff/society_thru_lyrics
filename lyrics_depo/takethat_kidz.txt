Kings and Queens and Presidents
Ministers of Governments
Welcome to the future of your world

Through talking heads that took liberties
The monkeys learnt to build machines
They think they'll get to heaven through the universe

They say nothing
Deny everything
And make counter accusations
My friends, my dear, my love, my God

There'll be trouble when the kidz come out (come out)
There will be lots for them to talk about (about)
There'll be trouble when the kidz come out
When the kidz come out, when the kidz come out
When the kidz come out

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
What you looking at
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You want a bit of that
Hey, hey, hey, hey
There will be trouble when the kidz come out
When the kidz come out 
Hey

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all?
The Good, the Bad, the Ugly or the Beautiful

Because it's up hill and against the wind
With no-one there to let us in
Leave your thoughts and save yourself you fool

The daggers of science
Evolving into violence
We're not sure where the fallout blows
But we all know Â·

There'll be trouble when the kidz come out (come out)
There will be lots for them to talk about (about)
There'll be trouble when the kidz come out
When the kidz come out, when the kidz come out
When the kidz come out

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
What you looking at
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You want a bit of that
Hey, hey, hey, hey
There will be trouble when the kidz come out
When the kidz come out 
Hey

Out on the streets tonight
They're making peace tonight
They're making peace

La, la, la, la... 

There'll be trouble when the kidz come out
There will be lots for them to talk about
There'll be trouble when the kidz come out
When the kidz come out, when the kidz come out

There'll be trouble when the kidz come out
