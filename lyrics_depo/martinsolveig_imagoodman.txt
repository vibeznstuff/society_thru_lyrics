(Oh yeah, Martin Solveig is the man you listen to.
Because when you're not listening to Martin Solveig
Let me tell you something, you are listening to nothing! Ah ah ho ho)

I see you brother, what's going on?
Did I do you wrong? Tell me what's going on.

I'm a good man, I'm a good man, I'm a good man, I'm a good man.

You don't know the way I feel, I'm on the bad side.
I do my best, I don't wanna fight, I do it with all my might.

I'm a good man, I'm a good man, I'm a good man, I'm a good man.

Oh! What's up with you?
I realise that some of you don't show enough respect.
Oh! What's up with you? I'm a good man, yeah! 



Do you really think? Do you really think I'd change?
By some dirty monster that I spend all my days, looking in the mirror.

I'm a good man, I'm a good man, I'm a good man
Yes I am, I'm a good man.

Come on! What's up with you? Have you changed your point of view?
Famous not a fade in me, I'm just a guy I used to be. Oh! 

Can you hear me? Can you feel me?
But now I'm a good man, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Don't put me down, don't put me down, don't put me down.
Famous not a fade in me, I'm just a guy I used to be.

But I'm a good man, the kind of man you need
I'm a kind of man you want, I'm a kind of man you need, oh yeah.

Thank you!
