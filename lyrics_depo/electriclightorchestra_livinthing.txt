Sailin' away on the crest of a wave
It's like magic
Rollin' and ridin' and slippin' &amp; slidin'
It's magic


And you, and your sweet desire,
You took me, higher and higher
It's a livin' thing,
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose.

Making believe this is what you've conceived
From your worst day,
Moving in line when you look back in time
To your first day



Takin' a dive 'cos you can't halt the slide
Floating downstream,
So let her go don't start spoiling the show
It's a bad dream
