Oh my goodness, I can't hide it
You just smiled when you walked by me
Oh my goodness
Warning signs that no one showed me
Lost control, but please don't hold me back
Gonna go for it, I hope you're ready for it
Oh

Cause I don't know if I can stop now
I'm going too fast, heart first
My head just can't slow me down
And I don't care if you don't break my fall
You got me dreaming of a life
That anybody else would die for

I'm rolling downhill, no brakes
Can't go back now, it's too late, oh
It's too late to look away, and unfeel what I feel for you
Look away, and unsee what I see in you
I'm gonna go for it, I hope you're ready

Cause I don't know if I can stop now
I'm going too fast, heart first
My head just can't slow me down
And I don't care if you don't break my fall
You got me dreaming of a life
That anybody else would die for
Oh baby, anybody else would die for

First sight I believed in first sight,
No second thoughts in my mind, just felt right
Oh my goodness, oh oh

Cause I don't know if I can stop now
I'm going too fast, heart first
My head just can't slow me down
And I don't care if you don't break my fall
You got me dreaming of a life
That anybody else would die for
You got me dreaming of a life
That anybody else would die for
Anybody else would die for
