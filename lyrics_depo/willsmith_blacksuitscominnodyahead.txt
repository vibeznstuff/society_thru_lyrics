Come-come on
Come on, come-come on-on
(MIB)
{The black suits comin'}
{The black suits comin'}
I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm comin'

I am the man in black
I'm back breakin' the back of the random attacker
So can the flack, yo'
I'm dangerous, I've been trained to bust
When a stranger fuss, tryin' to endanger us
Praise me, y'all, don't nothin' phaze me, y'all
When they see me they gage be all crazy y'all
They say I'm a myth, trust me if somebody rip
Out of the depths of your imagination appears Will Smith
Black suit, the black shades, the black shoes
Black tie with the black attitude
New style, black Raybans, I'm stunnin', man
New hotness, pitch black, 600, man
Don't you understand, what you thought I wouldn't come again
Leave you hangin' without bringin' you the fun again
Tanglin' with the alien scum again
Mind your manners or the black suits runnin' in

Nod ya head {The black suits comin'}
Let me see you nod ya head like this {The black suits comin'}
Let me see you (Nod ya head) like this {The black suits comin'}
Let me see you bop ya head, nod ya head, come on

(Nod ya head) {The black suits comin'}
Let me see you (Nod ya head) like this {The black suits comin'}
Let me see you nod ya head like this {The black suits comin'}
(Nod ya head...head...head...)

Check it, yo'
There's this chick right
Serleena makin' me sick, right
Earth is worthless to her, she be trippin' like
Threatenin' me and my mens, tryin' to get the light
Thinkin' she's superwomen, the black kryptonite
Finishin' whatever you start, son
The best looking crime fighter since myself in part one
Better act right, play nice and sing along
'Cause Kay is back and he hyped, what, bring it on

Uh, wanna brawl with me, tryin' to brawl with me
Uh-uh, what-what
Yo' {Black suits comin'}
What-what
Let me see ya just, come on

Just come on and nod ya head like this {The black suits comin'}
Let me see you nod ya head {The black suits comin'}
Let me see you nod ya head like this {The black suits comin'}
Let me see you (Nod ya head, MIB)

Let me see you nod ya head {The black suits comin'}
Let me see you (Nod ya head), come on, come on
Let me see you (Nod ya head) like this {The black suits comin'}
Let me see you (Nod ya head...head...head...)

Check it, check it
Yo', case closed, erase my foes
Chase the wave out of black suits, shades, and clothes
We above the law, feds can't touch me y'all
Highly ranked, black blank I.D. cards
So disregard what you think you saw
Put that phone down now, who you think you callin', huh
One little flash then, goodnight dear
Just open your eyes, honey, look right here, thank you
Mission completed, I mean it, we won't be defeated
You seen it, we did it, even with weapons depleted
Galaxy defenders, don't act like you don't remember
Takin' contenders and provn' they only pretenders
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
The men in black is back to protect the world
When the enemy is near, the elite is here
So have no fear

Just let me see you nod ya head {The black suits comin'}
Come on nod ya head like this {The black suits comin'}
Let me see you (Nod ya head) like this {The black suits comin'}
Let me see you (Nod ya head, MIB)

(Nod ya head) Woo (MIB)
(Nod ya head) Uh {The black suits comin'}
(Nod ya head) Yo' (MIB)
Yo', yo' (Nod ya head...head...head...)

If you wanna rock then say (Hey, oh)
Tell me if you wanna rock then say (Hey, oh)
If you wanna rock then say (Hey, oh)
Come on, if you wanna rock then say (Hey, oh)

Yo', if you wanna rock then say (Hey, oh)
Tell me if you wanna rock then say (Hey, oh)
If you wanna rock then say (Hey, oh)

(Nod ya head...head...head...)
