I saw two shadow men on the Vallance Road
Said they'd pay me for your address
Oh I was so bold

I said you see these two cold fingers
These crooked fingers I show
Yous a way to mean no

Well they didn't like that much I can tell you
Said "sunshine I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes"
They chased me up two flights of stairs
Caught me in the lift how I sighed and said
Hello, 'cause you're impossible

But it's just like he's in another world
He doesn't see the danger on show
Wind up like Joseph bloody in a hole

And it's just like she's in another world
And how they suit each other oh no
But they never get close
It's impossible

Saw the same two men on the Cally road
Said now they'd double their offer
I was so bold

To say you see these two cold fingers
These crooked fingers I show
Oh yous a way to mean no

But it's just like he's in another world
He doesn't see the danger on show
He'll end up like Joseph bloody in a hole

It's just like she's in another world
How they suit each other oh no
But you never get close
It's unstoppable

But it's just like we're all in another world
How we suit each other oh no
But we never get close
Thats close enough now...
