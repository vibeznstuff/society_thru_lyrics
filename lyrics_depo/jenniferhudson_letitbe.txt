When I find myself in times of trouble, mother Mary comes to me,
speaking words of wisdom, let it be. Let it be.
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me,
speaking words of wisdom, let it be. Let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be. Let it be.

And when the broken hearted people are living in the world agree,
there will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is still a chance that they may see,
there will be an answer, let it be. Let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be. Let it be.

And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light, that shines on me,
shine until the morning, let it be. Let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music, mother Mary, she comes to me,
she said, let it be, let it be, let it be....

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
I said let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be. Let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be. Let it be.
Let it be.
