Guard your dreams at night
Lock your heart up tight
It could happen to you
Don't count stars
Or you may stumble
Someone drops a sigh
And down you tumble
Keep an eye on spring

Run when churchbells ring

It could happen to you
All I did was wonder
How your arms would be
And it happened to me

All I ever did was wonder
How your arms would be
And it happened to me
