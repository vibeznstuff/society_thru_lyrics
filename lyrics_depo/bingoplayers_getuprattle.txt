This house party is crazy, my crew is hela wavy 
Yo, flip the cut, then say what's up, 
then slide out with your lady 
No ifs or buts about it, my style is technotronic 
Got grips and models so spin the bottle, 
girl I'm just getting started 

 
Get up, get up, get up 
Pump the volume, feel the base 
Get up, get up, get up 
Turn me on and let me do my thang 
Get up, get up, get up 
We in the house and we here to stay 
Get up, get up, get up! 

We be raging round the clock, 
feel that base around the block 
Fill that red cup to the top, birthday shots 
Doesn't matter, who you are, look around, we in the stars 
Round the world, we party all, 
We go all night strong until we drop 

 
Get up, get up, get up 
Pump the volume, feel the base 
Get up, get up, get up 
Turn me on and let me do my thang 
Get up, get up, get up 
We in the house and we here to stay 
Get up, get up, get up! 

Put your hands, put your, put your hands up 
Put your hands, put your, put your hands up 
Put your hands, put your, put your hands up 
Get up! 

We ain't going home, it's 6 in the morn' 
This house is bumping, friction on 
We ain't going home, even when the lights come on 
This house is bumping, base still go strong 
Get up!
