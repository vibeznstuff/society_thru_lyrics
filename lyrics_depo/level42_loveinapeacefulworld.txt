You came from out of nowhere
Yesterday
Well you blew my cool but that's ok!
I guess I couldn't run forever
Anyway
I knew I'd have to face the truth someday 

Strange after all these years
After all my tears
To find you there in front of me
When I lost you in the crowd
I was so full of doubt
But that's not the way it's meant to be 

Ego and pride
The great divide
I was but I'm not crazy now
Don't multiply
The tears we cry
I want love in a peaceful world 

I grew up with a small town
Mentality
Yeah, it's a universal frame of mind
I was trying to make the changes
But I couldn't see (oh, why are we so blind)
Couldn't see above the bottom line 

Searching for common ground
Used to bring me down
I had better ways to spend my days
Then I lost you in the crowd
I was so full of doubt
But that's not the way I feel today 

Ego and pride
The great divide
I was but I'm not faking now
Don't multiply
The tears we cry
I want love in a peaceful world
Can't be denied
Or justified
Hold me and stop me shaking now
Don't multiply
The tears we cry
I want love in a peaceful world 

Hey you
You gotta break out
You gotta follow through
You gotta try to find a way
Dream on
But don't lose the feelings
When there's nothing to hold on to
You gotta learn to feel your way 

Strange (strange) after all these years
After all my fears
To remember things we used to say
(strange) when I lost you in the crowd
I was so full of doubt
But that's not the way I feel today 

Ego and pride
The great divide
I was but I'm not crazy now
Don't multiply
The tears we cry
I want love in a peaceful world
Can't be denied
Or justified
Hold me and stop me shaking now
Don't multiply
The tears we cry
I want love in a peaceful world
Ego and pride
The great divide
I was but I'm not faking now
Don't multiply
The tears we cry
I want love in a peaceful world
Can't be denied
Or justified
Hold me and stop me shaking now
Don't multiply
The tears we cry
I want love in a peaceful world 

Transmit and receive
You gotta feel to believe
Wear my heart on my sleeve
I'll never lie or flatter to deceive you
Transmit and receive
You gotta feel to believe it
Wear my heart on my sleeve
Now that I found you - never gonna leave you 

Transmit and receive
I'll never lie or flatter to deceive you
You gotta believe
Now that I found you - never gonna leave you 

Oo-oo-ooh ...
