I was out on the highway
I was out on my feet
I was tired and hungry
I was late for the meet.

I had a red sky behind me
I had the bad guys on my tail
I had a hundred different reasons
To keep me falling awake
I had a red sky behind me
With the stars coming into view
And the thought that kept me going
Was soon I'm gonna make it with you

I had the desert on both sides now
I had the lights in my eyes
Of the town I remember
Up ahead in the cold black sky

I had a red sky behind me
I had the bad guys on my tail
I had a hundred different reasons
To keep me falling awake
I had a red sky behind me
With the stars coming into view
And the thought that kept me going
Was soon I'm gonna make it with you

Well I remember that old saying 'bout how good tomorrow will be
But will I be lucky to see with a red sky's lucky for me

In my dreams there is a picture of me in a big gold frame
And the poeple that I've never seen are pointing at my name

I had a red sky behind me
I had the bad guys on my tail
I had a hundred different reasons
To keep me falling awake
I had a red sky behind me
With the stars coming into view
And the thought that kept me going
Was soon I'm gonna make it with you

I had a red sky behind me
With the stars coming into view
And the thought that kept me going
Was soon I'm gonna make it with you
