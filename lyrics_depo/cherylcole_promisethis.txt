Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Démèler l'aile

In the beginning there was nothing so empty in the space between
And you came in turned the lights on and created what it's came to be
Before I pluck your wings cover me please spread your wings cover me and

Promise this if I die before I wake oh
Promise this take a time to say your grace
On your knees you pray for me
Promise this be the last to kiss my lips

Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Déployer l'aile

Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Démèler l'aile

Though I'm walking through the shadows you are with me and you comfort me
Lay me down now time for sleeping but before that would you restore me
Before I pluck your wings cover me please spread your wings cover me and

Promise this if I die before I wake oh
Promise this take a time to say your grace
On your knees you pray for me
Promise this be the last to kiss my lips

Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Déployer l'aile

Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Démèler l'aile

By a thread we're hanging on
In the hope you don't let go
If you ever leave me
No, I wanna go with you

Promise this if I die before I wake oh
Promise this take a time to say your grace
On your knees you pray for me
Promise this be the last to kiss my lips

Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Déployer l'aile

Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Déployer l'aile

Alouette, déployer les ailes
Alouette, plumerai les ailes
