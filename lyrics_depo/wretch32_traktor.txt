The mirror cant look me in my eyes no way
I float like a ribbon in the sky no plane
Ay yo, smooth or rugged Imma usain run it
Cah I duz it in my own lane
And Imma flash for the picture
She'll come back no hasta la vista
Computer love, I mac with my finger
Baby Im a man not your Mr I Missed Ya


My lifestyles terribly wild
But you'll never catch me on a Jeremy Kyle Show
Explosive, terrorist style
Dont think Imma blow I'll get you therapy now woah


I missed school and I havent got a job yet
My girls pissed, my daughters on the way
I went clubbing till my world was revolving
Pretty women and alcohol here
I ride this motherfuckin beat like a tractor
I ride this motherfuckin beat like a train
Choo choo go hard go faster
Stack pees every day
I ride this motherfuckin beat like a tractor
I ride this motherfuckin beat like a plane
Zoom zoom down the rabbit hole
More women more alcohol here


Im living my life coz dats what I do best
Girls on my bank wanna show me interest
Ay look pounds or pennies I dont scrounge of any
Im fly I am not an insect
And Im the life of the party
Came with Ken but I left with his Barbie
Babe is with me she can ride in the car seat
And shes an angel Im Charlie ah please


My lifestyles terribly wild
But you'll never catch me on a Jeremy Kyle Show
Explosive, terrorist style
Dont think Imma blow I'll get you therapy now woah


I missed school and I havent got a job yet
My girls pissed, my daughters on the way
I went clubbing till my world was revolving
Pretty women and alcohol here
I ride this motherfuckin beat like a tractor
I ride this motherfuckin beat like a train
Choo choo go hard go faster
Stack pees every day
I ride this motherfuckin beat like a tractor
I ride this motherfuckin beat like a plane
Zoom zoom down the rabbit hole
More women more alcohol here


Dont say my name when Im at the bar
(so gone)
Coz Im in the zone and Im trying my hardest not to fall
(so gone)
And Im so gone
(so gone)
Im so gone
(so gone)
Jus leave me alone
Alone


My lifestyles terribly wild
But you'll never catch me on a Jeremy Kyle Show
Explosive, terrorist style
Dont think Imma blow I'll get you therapy now woah


I missed school and I havent got a job yet
My girls pissed, my daughters on the way
I went clubbing till my world was revolving
Pretty women and alcohol here
I ride this motherfuckin beat like a tractor
I ride this motherfuckin beat like a train
Choo choo go hard go faster
Stack pees every day
I ride this motherfuckin beat like a tractor
I ride this motherfuckin beat like a plane
