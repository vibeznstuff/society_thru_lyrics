Top down there's a road on the backstreet 
Shot gun with a twin in the backseat 
No one with them two, it's just me 
Pull up to the club like a pimpsy 
Shouts out to the players in the VIP 
Hey DJ, yeah you remember me 
It's the nigga with same proof from outta suit 
And we be, we be 

Poppin' bottles, making noise 
On the tables, on the bars 
And at every bar 
Tell them girls to freak them boys 
I feel the patron jello shots 
I'm throwing one hundred dollar rain drops 
I live it up, yo, and they not, they not 
Cause today
