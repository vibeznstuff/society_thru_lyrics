Oh look at me so ordinary, no mystery, with no great capabilities,
But I could make out as if I had it but you know,
God I'm so obvious and I should let it go, oh I don't know.

I'm no teenage icon,
I'm no Frankie Avalon,
I'm nobody's hero.

Reserved and shy, your average guy,
No piercing stare, just out of shape with messy hair,
But I always figured I was somebody in wait,
And now I'm guessing that my moment must be late cause I'm here, oh

I'm no teenage icon,
I'm no Frankie Avalon,
I'm nobody's hero.

I'm not magnetic or mythical,
I'm suburban and typical,
But I got it, I got it
I'm overrun with it all.

Seductive charm a way with words so effortless
Not leather clad or dangerous,
But I always did it like a real rebel would,
I had a photo where John Lennon may have stood, or so I'm told.

I'm no teenage icon,
I'm no Frankie Avalon,
I'm nobody's hero.
