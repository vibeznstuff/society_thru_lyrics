Looking for a girl that was here but now she's gone,
Felt so good even though she didn't move on,
She knows what I want but she's bad for me,
She gets what she wants when she's touching me,
I shoulda known better but she took my self control,

You can take my heart like a criminal,
Won't you make me believe I'm the only one?
So grab me by the neck and don't you ever let go,
Mess me up so good until I'm begging for more,
You tear me apart like an animal...
Like an animal, animal,

I know I'm getting close from the trail of broken hearts,
Hope she coming back to finish what she started,
I never see the claws until she's touching me,
She's holding me so tight it's getting hard to breath,
I'll never win the game but it feels too good to care,

You can take my heart like a criminal,
(Like a criminal, like a criminal)
Won't you make me believe I'm the only one?
(I'm the only one, I'm the only one)
So grab me by the neck and don't you ever let go,
Mess me up so good until I'm begging for more,
You tear me apart like an animal...
Like an animal, animal,

Take me to the dark and don't you ever let go,
I like it when you treat me like an animal,
Take me to the dark and don't you ever let go,
I like it when you treat me like an animal,
Take me to the dark and don't you ever let go,
I like it when you treat me like an animal,
Take me to the dark and don't you ever let go,
I like it when you treat me like an animal,

(You can take my heart like a criminal)
So grab me by the neck and don't you ever let go,
Mess me up so good until I'm begging for more,
You tear me apart like an animal...
Like an animal, animal.
