Fuck her I'on care...
My new lady says she leaving me
Ah fuck her, I'on care
Plus I got another over there
She been wanting to be with me
Got her in her underwear
Gave her what she want, now she needin me
I got more of that coming over soon
Lingerie all up in my room
I'm a make this toast to that one girl I love
I still smell her perfume


Pour one up, no pour another
Pour one up, no pour another
Pour one up, no pour another
Numbing up


Since you've been away, love's been M.I.A.
Done looking for love, cause she took away her
Now I'm M.I.A., M.I.A., on love, on love
Done looking for love, cause she took away her love


Fuck her I'on care...
My new lady says she leaving me
Ah fuck her I don't care
Told me that she lovin me, yeah
I just give them the scenery, they won't ever compare
To the ones still got it
I call her up but she won't answer
And she knows what I'm looking for
And she knows what I'm looking for


Pour one up, no pour another
Pour one up, no pour another
Pour one up, Now pour me up some cause I'm Numbing uppppp


Since you've been away, Love's been M.I.A.
Done looking for love, cause she took away her
Now I'm MIA, MIA, on love, on love
Done looking for love, cause she took away her love


I be a rolling stone, missus, still tryna deal with ya
Loving too much will leave you blue and I ain't pledge Sigma
I'm a real nigga, giving feelings just ain't me
The more attention you give em, the more options they seek
Talk is cheap, knew I should've kept the receipt
She said she loyal, but all bitches gon' talk in the streets
That's how I play it, how I play it, all it is is game
As I hit another paper plane I'm M.I.A.
