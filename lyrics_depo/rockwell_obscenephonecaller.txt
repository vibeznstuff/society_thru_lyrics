I came home knocked out after work

That's when my telephone goes berserk.
How can I unwind or get some rest
Receiving sick phone calls from a lonely pest.
Find someone else to bother
Mister or Miss Obscene Phone Caller.
Why do you get off breathing on that phone

Obscene Phone Caller leave me alone.
Why did you have to pick me out of all the people in the directory

I don't know what's going thru' your mind

But these nackoff phone calls are a waste of time.
I must have my number changed
Or trace these calls from whence they came

If Alexander Bell were alive today
Would he want the telephone to be used this way?
Find someone else to bother
Mister or Miss Obscene phone Caller...
Obscene phone Caller
find someone else to bother.
Obscene phone Caller
you dirty little nasty twit
