I wend back to the doctor to get another shrink
I sit and tell him about my weekend,
but he never can change what he thinks
Can you see the real me, doctor-doctor
Can you see the real me, doctor, ooh, doctor

I went back to my mother, I said I'm crazy ma help me
She said I know how it feels son
Cause it runs in the family
Come on tell me can you see the real me mother mother
Can you see the real me mother whoa mother

Can you see can you see
Can you see the real me
Can you see, can you see the real me
The real me, the real me, the real me

The cracks between the pavement stones
Like rivers of flowing rain
Strange people who know me
From behind every window pane
The girl I used to love
Lives in the yellow house
Yesterday she passed me by she don't want to know me now

Can you see the real me, can ya, can ya
Can you see the real me whoa ya

I ended up with the Preacher full of lies and hate
I seemed to scare him a little ha ha
So he showed me to the golden gate

Whoa can you see the real me, Preacher
Preacher, can you see the real me Preacher whoa ya

Can you see, can you see, can you see, whoa ya
Can you see the real me doctor, doctor
Can you see the real me mama
Can you see the real me me me me
