Life felt so right
I was drowned in your light
With the world so in tune
'Til you made me out for a fool

Left with nothing to do
Can't forget about you
With my heart in my heart
Pack my bags, leave my memories with you

You gave me nothing but misery
I found so much more
You used me oh so helplessly
I don't want your sympathy

Why me?
Why me?
Why me when I was the one who could set your heart free?

Why me?
Why me?
Why me?
You took all the love I gave up selfishly
Why me?

Trapped in your space
Never thought I could face
Going one step beyond
When I knew deep inside I was strong

Now I know what it takes
Can't repeat the mistakes
When new love comes along
It'll give me what I'll call my own

You gave me nothing but misery
I found so much more
You used me oh so helplessly
I don't want your sympathy

Why me?
Why me?
Why me when I was the one who could set your heart free?
