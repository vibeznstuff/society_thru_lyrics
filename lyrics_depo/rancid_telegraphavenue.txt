I was there in the rain
Man, even if them skies were blue
You can find me on the corner of Durant
And Telegraph Avenue

When I was only 17
I knew what I had to do
So I grabbed my left handed guitar
And I headed out to Telegraph Avenue

Na na na na na, na na na na na na, na na
Na na na na na, na na na na na na, na na
Oh yeah

Mario Savio gave a speech
It was him against The Machine
For that he spent 3 months in jail
But he said he'd do it again

Governor Reagan had enough
So the National Guard they pushed on through
Tear gas and riot police
On Telegraph Avenue

Na na na na na, na na na na na na, na na
Na na na na na, na na na na na na, na na
Oh yeah

The ones who stand for freedom of speech
Well this one goes out to you
Well I can still hear your voice
On Telegraph Avenue

Na na na na na, na na na na na na, na na
Na na na na na, na na na na na na, na na
Oh yeah
