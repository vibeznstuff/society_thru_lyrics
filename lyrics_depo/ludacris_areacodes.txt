Now you thought I was just 7-7-0

It's the abominabol "O" man
Globe-trot international post man
Neighbor-dick dope man
7-1-8s, 2-0-2's
I send small cities and states I-O-U's
9-0-1, matter fact 3-0-5
I'll jump off the d-4, we can meet outside
So control your hormones and keep your drawers on
'Til I close the door and I'm jumping your bone
3-1-2, 3-1-3, 2-1-5, 8-0-3
Read your hor-o-scope and eat some hor-derves
Ten I pump one these hoes is self serve

Now everyday is a hol-i-day
So stop the violence and put the 4-4 away, keeps you to hold today
5-0-4, 9-7-2

You checkin up the scene, I'm checkin a ho tonight
With perpendicular vehicular homicide
3-1-4, 2-0-1
Too much green, too much fun
I bang cock in Bangkok
Can't stop, I turn and hit the same spot
Think not, I'm the thrilla in Manilla, 
Schlong in Hong Kong
Pimp em like vision, magic Don Juan
Man after Henny with a coke and a smile
I just pick up the muthafuckin phone and dial
I got my condoms in a big-ass-sack
I'm slaggin this dick like a New Jack, biatch


Is it cuz they like my gangsta walk?
Is it cuz they like my gangsta talk?
Is it cuz they like my handsome face?
Is it cuz they like my gangsta ways?
Whatever it is, they love it
And they just won't let me be
I handle my biz, don't rush me
Just relax and let me be free
Whenever I call, come running
2-1-2 or 2-1-3
You know that I ball, stop frontin
'For I call on something to free
