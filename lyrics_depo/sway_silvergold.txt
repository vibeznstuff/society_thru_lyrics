Ohhh
Yeah
Akon
And

Konvict

That girl ain't no joke
I love the way she roll
Especially when she working going up and down that pole
Cause she's a professional and she'll stick you up without a weapon, oh she's so cold
If you don't know she'll rob you for your silver and gold (gold, gold, gold, gold)
She will take it and go (go, go, go, go)
For your silver and gold (gold, gold,)
She will take it and go (go, go, go, go)
If you don't know...

Just hoped off a plane
Name just popped up again
UK just got hot again
Konvict Muzik, top for the game
I'm in tha club and I'm watching the dame
Who's in love cause she's watching the watching the chain
And where there is drop over range
One thing is for sure
It's the top of the range
Clubs about to close
Follow me to my crib, come without your clothes
Most girls are happy with a rose
She rather have bottles of rose hennessy and mo
She's out for the dough
She'll bounce for anyone with an account full of 0s
Got bounced from anyone when her account gets low
Cause money money money makes the girls get low

Yeah I wanna beat, got the whole club feeling like rio on the beach
She got them pretty Louis V upon her feet
And she loves me cause I'm a CEO of my team
And she could tell where you came,
Running with Akon but I ain't T-Pain
Get a little change, but I exchange pounds
Make it thunder in the club, who da hell needs rain
Baby love glamour she ain't never been played
She loves London but she ain't never been Spain
She's always tellin me how much she loves my accent
But she's thinkin to herself, what the hell is he saying
Yeah she's out for the dough
She'll bounce for anyone with an account full of 0s
Got bounced from anyone when her account gets low
Cause money money money makes the girls get low

Beggin for mercy...
