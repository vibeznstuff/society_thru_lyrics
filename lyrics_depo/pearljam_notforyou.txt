restless soul, enjoy your youth
like muhammad hits the truth
can't escape from the common rule
if you hate something, don't you do it too...too...
small my table, a sits just two
got so crowded, i can't make room
oh, where did they come from? stormed my room!
and you dare say it belongs to you...to you...
this is not for you
this is not for you
this is not for you
oh, not for you...ah, you...
...scream...my friends...don't call me...
...friends, no they don't scream...
...my friends don't call...my friends don't...
all that's sacred comes from youth
dedication, naive and true
with no power, nothing to do
i still remember, why don't you...don't you...
this is not for you
this is not for you
this is not for you
oh, never was for you...fuck you...
this is not for you...
oh, this is not for you...yeah, you...
this is not for you...
oh, not for you...
oh, you...
