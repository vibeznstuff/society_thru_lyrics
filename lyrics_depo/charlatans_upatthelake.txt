I don't see no wheat fields from my window today
I don't feel no sunshine when I'm up at the lake
And I've seen this once before
And I'll say it once again
All I want is the truth
'Cause I sold my soul to you

I know I've got a handful, and I'm done fit to burst
I know one fine lady who will always come first
And I've seen you to the stars
And I'll say it through the stem
My little leprechaun
My little leprechaun

Ohh

I do believe the pain is deep
It kills my heartbeat, and it dulls society
I do believe the pain is real
It kills my heartbeat, and it dulls society

Whoo

I don't feel no pleasure when there's only a pain
I like a hit of bugle with a toot of champagne
And you see me on fire
And you see me borderline
There is a world

I do believe the pain is deep
It kills my heartbeat, and it dulls society
I do believe the pain is real
It kills my heartbeat, and it dulls society

Oh

I do believe the pain is deep
It kills my heartbeat, and it dulls society
I do believe the pain is real
It kills my heartbeat, and it dulls society
