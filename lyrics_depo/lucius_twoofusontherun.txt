There are two of us on the run
Going so fast, every doubt we had is coming undone
And falling behind with everything we left there
We held on for far too long

And now we pass so many people on the road
They could come along, I wish they'd been told
They may call it a shot in the dark
From what we know, it's not unheard of

And we'll one day tell our story
Of how we made something of ourselves now

Our favorite parts are what we'll keep
Ornamental parts of love and parts of memories
So everything else has room to grow
'Cause in better light, everything changes

So we can one day tell our story
Of how we made something of ourselves now

There's no race, there's only a runner
Just keep one foot in front of the other
There's no race there's only a runner
1, 2, 3 even when you get tired
Just keep one foot in front of the other
There's no race, no ending in sight
No second too short, no window too tight

Just turn off the lights when you leave
'Cause we've got everything we're gonna need
We're on the run, we're on the run, we're on the run child
We gotta run, we gotta run, we gotta run child

One day tell our story
Of how we made something of ourselves now

One day tell our story
Of how we made something
We made something of ourselves
