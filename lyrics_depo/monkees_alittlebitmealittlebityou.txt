Walk out, girl, don'tcha walk out
We've got things to say
Talk out, let's have it talked out
And things will be okay

Girl, I don't want to fight
I'm a little bit wrong, and you're a little bit right
I said girl, you know that it's true
It's a little bit me, and it's a little bit you, too

Don't know just what I said wrong
But girl, I apologize
Don't go, here's where you belong
So wipe the tears from your eyes

Girl, I don't want to fight
I'm a little bit wrong, and you're a little bit right
I said girl, you know that it's true
It's a little bit me, and it's a little bit you, too

Oh girl, I don't want to fight
I'm a little bit wrong, and you're a little bit right
I said girl, you know that it's true
It's a little bit me, and it's a little bit you, too

It's a little bit me, it's a little bit you
Girl, I'm gone, no no no no no
Girl I'm gone, no no no no no
Hey, girl
