Wooo, here we go The table's set baby 
Wooo, ahh here we go 
My oven is hot

Come on get some, in Martika's kitchen baby
You bring the noise and I'll bring the smile
It's been so long since you've been down in the kitchen baby 
My desire's running longer than a country mile 

So true, you can make all my wishes 
So real, you can make all my dreams
And if you're good baby, 
I'll even let you break the dishes 
Come on get some, get some, get some 
In Martika's kitchen baby
Ooh we're talkin' about the kitchen

Don't you just love spring time in the city 
Ba-Ba-Boom box 
kick-kick-kickin' out the latest jams 
Boys dancin for all the girls lookin so pretty
Love is in the air Inhibitions be damned 

So true, you can make all my wishes 
So real, you can make all my dreams
And if you're good baby, 
I'll even let you break the dishes 
Come on get some, get some, get some 
In Martika's kitchen baby
Ooh we're talkin' about the kitchen

The table is set 
The oven is hot 
Baby when we get started 
We won't e-e-ever stop
Come on, get some 
Get, get, get some  
You can make all my wishes
Come on baby let me hear you say you're with it
Come on sweetie if you're good
I'll let you get it
I don't care, I've got the chair
If you think your butt'll fit it
You turn me all the way up, I admit it 

Come on get some In Martika's kitchen baby
You bring the noise and I'll bring the smile
It's been so long since you've been down to the kitchen baby
My desire's ru-ah-ah-ning longer than a country mile
So T-R-U-E true

The table is set The oven is hot
Baby when we get started we wo-o-on't ever stop

Come on get some in Martika's kitchen baby
You bring the noise and I'll bring the smile
So true, you can make all my wishes
So real, you can make all my dreams

And if you're good baby, 
I'll even let you break the dishes
I'll even let you break the dishes
Come on get some, get some, get some
In Martika's kitchen baby

You can make all my wishes
The kitchen baby 
You can make all my dreams
The kitchen baby
I'll even let you break the dishes
Martika's kitchen baby 
Get some, get some, get some
