(Hello!?)

And there's the rub, we can talk for a while
But I have sweet nothings to say 
You don't want me anyway, you don't want me anyway 
So why, why should I stay? 

So goodbye to you and your life 
Your new best friends, your confidence 
And I'll be here when you get home 

Sitting halfway, away from nowhere 
Praying for our lips to touch 
Holding myself for a second 
Just to catch you smile on this line 

So goodbye to you and your life (two months, eight weeks) 
Your new best friends, your confidence (turn my hours into days) 
And I'll be here when you get home (when you get home) 

So goodbye to you and your life (two months, eight weeks) 
Your new best friends, your confidence (turn my hours into days) 
And I'll be here when you get home, when you get home 



Is it just like you said it would be (it's never easy), 
I can't feel this way about you anymore 
Is it just like you said it would be (it's never easy),
I can't feel the same 

I can't feel this way, 
I can't feel the same about you anymore (it's never easy)
About you anymore (it's never easy)
No, I can't feel this way
I can't feel the same about you anymore (it's never easy)
About you anymore (it's never easy)
About you anymore
