If I thought it would help, I would immolate myself
In full view of the camera crews, my counterclaim
But as we all know, the only tale that would be told
Would be that it was me, not them, who was insane

But who the fuck do I think I am fooling?
As if I know the first thing of sacrifice or selflessness
I'm the cop just out of frame, who at the first sight of the flames
Throws himself prostrate to the ground in reverence

An act so pure we yearn to feel the burn

Who the fuck do I think I am fooling?
As if I know the first thing of sacrifice or selflessness
They say that Quang Duc's heart survived the flames unscarred
A righteous calling card, left upon the palace gates
For the invertebrates, their grip on power pried apart
By just one frail human being. No weapon, no war machine
