She was a jezebel, this Brixtonqueen
Livin' the life like a back street dream
Tellin' me lies when the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear

Spinnin' me 'round like a wheel on fire
Walkin' on tightrope, my love's high wire
Fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escapin' me

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
When I'm lying in the midnight hour
Holding you just like a dream (dream)
Love is never what it seems

When we touch
And you're holding me the way you do
Girl, you make my dreams come true
You make my dreams come true

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you (huh)
And show you the way I feel (huh huh huh)

She was a Geminion the cusp of Mars
She holds me back or she too far
Windin' me up just to let her down
So emotional, gagged and bound

There's more to this than meets the eye
A devil woman locked inside
With the full moon rising, I was scared
I think I was possessed

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you (huh huh huh huh huh huh)
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
Every time your body's next to mine
Something deep inside of me
Wants to love you endlessly

When we touch
Girl, you don't know how it makes me feel
I just can't believe it's real
I can't believe it's real

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

She got an attitude I can't explain
You never know if you're in frame
Tying me up with elastic words
I'm on the countdown till I get heard

Her blood was hot, she burned so bright
A neon sign there in the night
It's hard to say if I went too far
My heart still bears a scar

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you (huh huh huh huh)

(I just wanna be close to you)
She was a jezebel, this Brixton queen
Livin' the life like a back street dream
Tellin' me lies when the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear

(I just wanna be close to you)
Spinnin' me 'round like a wheel on fire
Walkin' on tightrope, my love's high wire
Fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escapin' me

I wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you (I just wanna be close to you, baby)
And show you the way I feel

I wanna be close to you (baby)
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel
