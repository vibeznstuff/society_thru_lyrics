When I walk around
People stare me down
Don't make a sound
I stand my ground
I fight back (fight back!)
Yeah it's like that (and it's like that!)

You can stare me down
If you dare me now
I will show you clowns
How we ground and pound
'Cause I fight back (fight back!)
And it's like that ('cause it's like that!)

Look who fired the shot
I just fired the shot
We fired the shot
Look who fired the shot


Yeah, it's like that (it's like that!)
It's like that!

Bho bho bho bho!!

To protect and serve
A full time reserve
Pull to the curb
Workin' up the nerve
To fight back
'Cause it's like that (yeah it's like that!)

I will grow my herb
You better spread the word
No matter what you heard
This whole thing's absurd
Let's fight back (fight back!)
'Cause it's like that (yeah it's like that, come on!)

Look who fired the shot
I just fired the shot
We fired the shot
Look who fired the shot


And it's like that
And it's like that
And it's like that
Fire

Look who fired the shot
I just fired the shot
We fired the shot
Look who fired the shot


Bho bho bho bho!!
