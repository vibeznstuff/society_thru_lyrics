Sugar, sugar, baby, oh oh oh yeah

Me and Mrs. Jones
We've got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong to let it go now

We meet ev'ry day at the same cafe
Six-thirty and I know she'll be there
Holding hands, making all kinds of plans
While the jukebox plays our favorite song

Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones
Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
We've got a thing going on, yeah
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong to let it cool down

We gotta be extra careful
That we don't build our hopes up too high, yeah
'Cause she's got her own, her own obligations
And so, so, so do I

Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones
Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
We've got a thing going on, yeah
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong to let it go now

Well, it's time for us to be leaving
It hurts so much, it hurts so much inside, yeah
Now she'll go her way and I'll go mine
Tomorrow we'll meet the same place, the same time

Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones
Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
Yeah, we've got a thing going on

We've got a thing going on
We've got a thing going on
We've got a thing going on

We've got a thing going on
We've got a thing going on
We've got a thing going on
