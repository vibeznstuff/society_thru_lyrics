Come on now!

Sit down girl! I think I love ya!
And all I want you to do, is repeat after me
Say A, say B, say C, oh I think she's got it

ABC is easy it's like counting up to three
Sing a simple melody, that's how easy love can be


Simple melody, simple melody, sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be


That's how easy love can be

Come on now!

ABC is easy it's like counting up to three
Sing a simple melody, that's how easy love can be


Simple melody, simple melody, sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be


That's how easy love can be


123, baby, ooh ooh
ABC, baby, nah nah
Do re mi, baby, ow


Simple melody, simple melody, sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be


That's how easy love can be
