Oh, sitting on a crowded train
I feel good, I feel good, I feel good oh yeah
Wishing all the time away
Till that day, that day

I give you my hand
Now come rescue me
For better or worse, I do

Oh Jesse hold on
Just hold on, and on, and on, and on
Oh Jesse be strong
Just hold on, and on, and on, and on

Every little thing I do
It's for you, I'll be true, yes I do oh yeah
Never mind the stormy weather
We'll blow the clouds away

I give you my hand
Now come rescue me
For better or worse, I do

Oh Jesse hold on
Just hold on, and on, and on, and on
Oh Jesse be strong
Just hold on, and on, and on, and on

Oh Jesse hold on
I feel good, I feel good, I feel good, oh yeah
Oh Jesse be strong
It's for you I'll be true yes I do

Stop waiting, all the waiting is gone
Stop waiting, all the waiting is gone
And on, and on, and on
It's gone and on, and on, and on

Yes it's gone and on, and on, and on
Yes it's gone and on, and on, and on
Yes it's gone

Oh Jesse hold on
Just hold on, and on, and on, and on
(You gotta hold on)
Oh Jesse be strong
Just hold on, and on, and on, and on
Oh Jesse be strong
Just hold on, and on, and on, and on
(You gotta hold on)

Oh Jesse be strong
Just hold on
