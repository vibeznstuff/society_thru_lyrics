Heats the message that you send
One look at you, I'm burning up inside
You know that I'd give up anything
I can't get enough when you get next to me

Oh you, hey, some kinda woman
You some kinda woman

You cut a notch every time a heart is breaking
One time and then you, oh, never let 'em off
Once you've fixed your sightsv
Oh, I want you, I want to tie you to me

Oh, don't hesitate, you got the touch to set me free

I'm like a kid standing outside your door
You make me feel like never before
I feel the heat rising up in my soul
I'm burning out of control

Oh, break down this heat 'cause what you're doing just makes me weak
The way you stand there in your clothes, giving me a look like Edward G.
And then you start to shake the place
And then you lock on tight to the groove
Oh, I want to get it on, looking for the chance to make a move

Look into my heart for what you want
Saying that you will and then you won't
Look into my heart for what you want
Saying that you do and then you don't
