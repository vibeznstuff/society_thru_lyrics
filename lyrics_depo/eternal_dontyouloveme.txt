Child goes to the store for a loaf of bread
(Don't you love me, don't you love me no more)
Bullets flying all around his head
(Don't you love me, don't you love me no more)
Said he's hurting, gone and lost his job
(Don't you love me, don't you love me no more)
To feed his family got to steal and rob
(Don't you love me, don't you love me no more) 

All he wants to know is do you love me
(Do you love me, don't you love me no more)
All he needs to know is do you love me
(Do you love me, don't you love me no more) 

Why does granny have to walk the streets?
(Don't you love me, don't you love me no more)
Trying to find a sheltered place to sleep
(Don't you love me, don't you love me no more) 

See the cops arrest another child
(Don't you love me, don't you love me no more)
Mother, mother crying I dont know where he is
(Don't you love me, don't you love me no more) 

It's a shame, is that all we have to say
It's all the same, if we just turn and walk away
When somebody needs you, their arms trying to reach you
I'm begging please have a heart 

Don't you love me, don't you love me no more
Don't you love me
Don't you love me 

All he wants to know is do you love me
Don't you love me, don't you love me no more
All he wants to know is do you love me
Do you love me, don't you love me no more
All she wants to know is do you love me
Do you love me, don't you love me no more
All she wanst to know is do you love me
Do you love me, don't you love me no more
