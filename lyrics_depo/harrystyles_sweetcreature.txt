Sweet creature
Had another talk about where it's going wrong
But we're still young
We don't know where we're going but we know where we belong

And ohhhh, we started
Two hearts in one home
It's hard when we argue
We're both stubborn, I know

But oh
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home

Sweet creature
Running through the garden, oh, where nothing bothered us
But we're still young
I always think about you and how we don't speak enough

And ohhhh, we started
Two hearts in one home
I know it's hard, we argue
We're both stubborn, I know

But oh
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home

And ohhh, when we started
Just two hearts in one home
It gets harder when we argue
We're both stubborn, I know

But oh
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home
You bring me home
