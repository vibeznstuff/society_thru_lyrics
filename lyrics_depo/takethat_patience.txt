Just have a little patience
I'm still hurting from a love I lost
I'm feeling your frustration
Any minute all the pain will stop.

Just hold me close inside your arms tonight
Don't be too hard on my emotions.


'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb, has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try and have a little patience.

I really wanna start over again
I know you wanna be my salvation
The one that I can always depend.

I'll try to be strong
Believe me I'm trying to move on
It's complicated but understand me.



'Cause the scars run so deep
It's been hard but I have to believe
Just have a little patience 



Have a little patience
My heart is numb, has no feeling
So while Iâ€™m still healing
Just try and have a little patience
