I am so sick and tired of this world
All these women with their dreams shattered
From some man's sweaty, desperate touch
God damn it, I've had enough
When did you come to think refusal was sexy?
Can't you see the tears in her eyes?
How did you ever think you had the right to
Put your entitled hands up her thighs?

You are the problem here
You are the problem here
No one made you do anything
You are the problem here
You are the problem here
No one made you do anything

And I
And I hope you fucking suffer

Do you really expect anyone to feel sorry
That you ruined your own life?
You did it when you thought you had the right to
Put your entitled hands up her thighs
And we don't need to be diminished
To sisters or daughter or mothers
I am a human being, that is how you relate to me

You are the problem here
You are the problem here
No one made you do anything
That's not how liquor works
You are the problem here
You are the problem here
No one made you do anything

And I
And I
And I
And I
And I
And I hope you fucking suffer
