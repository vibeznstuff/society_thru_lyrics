We've got to run
If you're holding on the seams will come undone
And you'll only get part of me
We don't want to catch a break while we're playing it safe
You'll only get part of me

But I'm always looking forward for an open door
I found an outlet for all my feelings
They're trying to cut the cord

I'm thinking we've got to run
If you're holding on the seams will come undone
And you'll only get part of me
We don't want to catch a break while we're playing it safe
You'll only get part of me

But there's always a place for you here in my wild heart
I dream of you on a highway under a thousand stars
We can have it all
Just like we're dreaming
We can have it all
I can make it on my own

We've got to run
If you're holding on the seams will come undone
And you'll only get part of me
We don't want to catch a break while we're playing it safe
You'll only get part of me

And you can have it all
Just like we're dreaming
