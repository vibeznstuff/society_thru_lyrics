Stare case lying face up
Stare cat on a mat
Looking down

Slide down the banister
Take the escalator
Slide down the banister
Or try the elevator

I was standing on the landing
Now I'm standing in the hall
Looking up

Won't someone assist me
Solve this mystery
Somebody assist me
Arrange the symmetry

Muffled footsteps on the carpet
Spiral steps start spinning
Around me

Which floor which ceiling
You're off balance
Which floor which ceiling
It's all upside down

Stare case lying face up
Stare cat on a mat
Looking down...
