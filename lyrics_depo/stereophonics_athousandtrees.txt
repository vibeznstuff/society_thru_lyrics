Standing at the bus stop with my shopping in my hands
And I'm overhearing elder ladies
As the rumours start to fly
You can hear them in the school yard
In the scrap yard
In the chip shop
In the phone box
In the pool hall
At the shoe store
Every corner turn around
It started with a school girl
Who was running
Running home to her Mam and Dad
Told them she was playing, in the change room of the local foorball side
They said tell us again, she told them again, tell us the truth, they find it hard to believe
'Cause he taught our I was steve, he even trained me, taught our John who's a father of three

Only takes one tree, to make 1000 matches
Only takes one match, to burn A thousand trees
A thousand trees

You see it in the classroom
In the swimming pool
Where the match stick men are made
At the scout's hall
At the football
Where the wise we trust are paid
They all honour his name
He did a lot for the game
Got his name knocked up above the sports ground gates
But they're ripping them down, stamping the ground
Picture gathers dust behind the bar in the lounge

Only takes one tree, to make a thousand matches
Only takes one match, to burn a thousand trees
A thousand trees

Wake up, and smell the rain
Shake up, he's back to stay
He hasn't been on a holiday
His growing seeds don't believe
Why he's been away
From the school yard
Changing room
Playing field
Bathroom
Phone box
Office blocks
Corners turn around
They keep doubting the flame, tossing the blame
Got his name knocked up above the sports ground gates
And they're ripping them down, stamping the ground
Picture gathers dust in the bar

Only takes one tree, to make a thousand matches
Only takes one match, to burn A thousand trees
A thousand trees
A thousand trees
A thousand trees
