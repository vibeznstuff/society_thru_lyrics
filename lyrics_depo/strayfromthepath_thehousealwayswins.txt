We came, we saw, he died
We came, we saw, he died
We came, we saw, he died
We came, we saw, he died
We came, we saw, he died
We came, we saw...

Break, motherfucker
Yo they're making you an offer that you can't refuse
Yeah break, motherfucker
Yeah you bet against the house and you're gonna lose
Break, mother fucker
We're all fucked no matter who we choose
Yeah break, motherfucker
Yeah you bet against the house and you're gonna lose

Bare witness
Yo business is business
A two faced coin either side there's no difference
Who can you buy to tell a lie? This shit is viscous
The deck is rigged don't call em out they keep a hit list
Two sides polarized, social suicide
Homegrown invasion to enslave the nation
But you decide
Burn the ballots sweep em under the rug
Who's your leader? Trick question
None of the above


They are not our friends. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people

Break, motherfucker
Yo they're making you an offer that you can't refuse
Yeah break, motherfucker
Yeah you bet against the house and you're gonna lose
Break, mother fucker
We're all fucked no matter who we choose
Yeah break, motherfucker
Yeah you bet against the house and you're gonna lose

Here we go again
The cycle repeats, four years of defeat
Wrong way down a one way street
The fix is in, the price will make your head spin
Their calling the shots, and you're not
Politicians hitting the jack pot
The debates begun
Gays, gods and guns
Everyone hates everyone
I'm done
Burn the ballots sweep em under the rug
Who's your leader? Trick question
None of the above

You wanna keep 'em silent
You try to keep 'em silent
You wanna keep 'em silent
But the people wanna riot
You try to keep 'em silent
But we wanna fucking riot
We wanna fucking riot
We wanna fucking riot
You wanna keep 'em silent
The people wanna riot
You try to keep 'em silent
We wanna fucking riot

Break, motherfucker
Yo they're making you an offer that you can't refuse
Yeah break, motherfucker
Yeah you bet against the house and you're gonna lose
Break, mother fucker
We're all fucked no matter who we choose
Yeah break, motherfucker
Yeah you bet against the house and you're gonna lose
