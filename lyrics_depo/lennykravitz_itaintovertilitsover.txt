Here we are still together 
We are one 
So much time wasted 
Playing games with love 

So many tears I've cried 
So much pain inside 
But baby It ain't over 'til it's over 
So many years we've tried 
To keep our love alive 
But baby it ain't over 'til it's over 

How many times 
Did we give up 
But we always worked things out 
And all my doubts and fears 
Kept me wondering, yeah 
If I'd always, always be in love 

So many tears I've cried 
So much pain inside 
But baby It ain't over 'til it's over 
So many years we've tried 
And kept our love alive 
'Cause baby it ain't over 'til it's over 

So many tears I've cried 
So much pain inside 
Baby It ain't over 'til it's over 
So many years we've tried 
And kept our love alive 
'Cause baby it ain't over 'til it's over 

So many tears I've cried 
So much pain inside 
Baby It ain't over 'til it's over 
So many years we've tried 
And kept our love alive 
'Cause baby it ain't over 'til it's over 
Over, over, over. 

So many tears I've cried 
So much pain inside 
But baby It ain't over 'til it's over 
So many years we've tried 
To kept our love alive 
'Cause baby it ain't over 'til it's over 
Over, over, over 

So many tears I've cried 
So much pain inside 
Baby It ain't over 'til it's over
