I know you know I've been damaged, savaged
You know I know that it's sordid, it's horrid

But you are not the only one I love
You think you're someone sent from up above
Well I kiss your hands, your feet, your hair

Well if I'm a man, then I'm your fan
You're the best thing that I'm ever gonna have
So take my hand and carry on and on, and on, and on

Ain't no mistaking this is taking and raping
I'm sick and tired from
Dreams awaking I'm faking

But you are not the only one I love
You think I'm someone sent from up above
I kiss your hands, your feet, your hair

Well if I'm a man, then I'm your fan
You're the best thing that I'm ever gonna have
So take my hand and carry on and on, and on, and on...

I know you know I've been damaged
You know I know that is sordid

But you are not the only one I love
You think you're someone sent from up above
Well I kiss your hands, your feet, your hair

Well if I'm a man, then I'm your fan
You're the best thing that I'm ever gonna have
So take my hand and carry on and on, and on, and on...
