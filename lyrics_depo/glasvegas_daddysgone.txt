How you are my hero
How you're never here though
Remember times when you put me on your shoulders
How I wish it was forever you would hold us
Right now I'm too young to know
How in the future it will affect me when you go
You could have had it all
You, me, and mum y`know
Anything was possible

I wont be the lonely one
Sitting on my own and sad
A fifty year old
Reminiscing what i had

I wont be the lonely one
Sitting on my own and sad

Forget your dad, he's gone
Forget your dad, he's gone

All I wanted was a kick-a-bout in the park
For you to race me home when it was nearly getting dark
How I could've been yours, and you'd be mine
It could've been me and you until the end of time
Do what you want, when you want
Be as fucking insincere as you can
What kind of way is that to treat your wife
To see your son on Saturdays
What way is that to live your life?

I wont be the lonely one
Sitting on my own and sad
A fifty year old
Reminiscing what I had

I wont be the lonely one
Sitting on my own and sad

Forget your dad, he's gone
