Hmm, he-he
Oh, hey
Doesn't matter (It doesn't matter)
Doesn't matter at all

Doesn't matter what your friends are telling you 
Doesn't matter what my family's saying too 
It just matters that I'm in love with you 
It only matters that you love me too 

It doesn't matter if they won't accept you 
I'm accepting of you and the things you do 
Just as long as it's you 
Nobody but you, baby, baby

My love for you, unconditional love too 
Gotta get up, get up 
Get up, get up, get up and show you that it¡­

Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing 
Cause I'm in love with the inner being 
And it doesn't really matter what they believe 
What matters to me is you're in love with me 

Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing 
Cause I'm in love with the inner being 
And it doesn't really matter what they believe 
What matters to me is you're nutty-nutty-nutty for me 

(You're so kind) 
Just what I asked for, you're so loving and kind 
(And you're mine)
And I can't believe you're mine

Doesn't matter if you're feeling insecure 
Doesn't matter if you're feeling so unsure 
Cause I'll take away the doubt within your heart 
And show that my love will never hurt or harm 

Doesn't matter what the pain we go through 
Doesn't matter if the money's gone too 
Just as long as I'm with you 
Nobody but you, baby, baby

You're love for me, unconditional I see 
Gotta get up, get up 
Get up, get up, get up and show you that it¡­

Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing 
Cause I'm in love with the inner being 
And it doesn't really matter what they believe 
What matters to me is you're in love with me 

Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing 
Cause I'm in love with the inner being 
And it doesn't really matter what they believe 
What matters to me is you're nutty-nutty-nutty for me 

(You're so kind) 
Just what I asked for, you're so loving and kind 
(And you're mine)
And I can't believe you're mine

Doesn't matter what they say 
Cause you know I'm gonna love you anyway 
Doesn't matter what they do 
Cause my love will always be with you 

My love for you unconditional love too 
Gotta get up, get up 
Get up, get up, get up and show you that
My love is true, and it's just for you, uh 

Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing 
Cause I'm in love with the inner being 
And it doesn't really matter what they believe 
What matters to me is you're in love with me 

Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing 
Cause I'm in love with the inner being 
And it doesn't really matter what they believe 
What matters to me is you're nutty-nutty-nutty for me

Nutty-nutty-nutty my love for you 
I can't believe my dreams come true 
I've finally found somebody whose heart is true 
And best of all you love me to
And nutty-nutty-nutty my love for you 
I can't believe my dreams come true 
I've finally found somebody whose heart is true 
And best of all you're nutty-nutty-nutty for me 

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
