I saw stars on the pavement
California dreams
Looked up through the bright lights
No stars that I see

You said, "It’s all yours if you take it there."
I said, "I can’t do it alone, I swear."
You said, "It’s all yours,
It’s all yours when you smile."

It’s only you
Who loves me like you do
Trying to keep it cool
But I can’t keep cool about it
Acting like a fool
Wanna scream it from the roof
I’m trying to keep it cool
But I can’t keep cool about it (about it)

Before you, love, I was lost
Drifting at sea
You were the beacon I’d followed home
You were the one who rescued me

You said, "It’s all yours if you take it there."
I said, "I can’t do it alone, I swear."
You said, "It’s all yours,
It’s all yours when you smile."

It’s only you
Loves me like you do
Trying to keep it cool
But I can’t keep cool about it
Acting like a fool
Wanna scream it from the roof
I’m trying to keep it cool
But I can’t keep cool about it (about it)

You said, "Oh, whoa.
I won’t lose you, no, whoa."

It’s only you
Loves me like you do
Trying to keep it cool
But I can’t keep cool about it
Acting like a fool
Wanna scream it from the roof
I’m trying to keep it cool
But I can’t keep cool about it (about it)
