Another lonely Monday morning and I don't want to face the world outside
No control
You got someone there to make you smile
But I cry alone
Givin' those secret feeling

You never cooperate, share your love with me
I try in vain to seize your heart
Please don't keep me waiting for that sign
Give me one good reason why you say goodnight and mean goodbye
Please let me

Let me wake up in your arms
Let me go down in your dreams
There is so much we can do before tomorrow and what tomorrow means
I want to get close to you
Every single word I swear is true
On bended knees, I beg you
Let me wake up in your arms

It's gotta be now or never that heaven in your eyes
You touch me hand and I just die
If you got no one there to see you through, I'm standing by
I give you my secret feelings

Another lonely Monday morning and I don't want to face the truth inside
'cause you're not mine
Maybe I've been reachin' far too high
I may be somebody you don't know
But I won't let you forget me, let me

Let me wake up in your arms
Let me go down in your dreams
There is so much we can do before tomorrow and what tomorrow means
Baby I want to get close to you
Every single word I swear is true
On bended knees I beg you
Let me wake up in your arms

I won't let you forget me
Let me, let me, let me

Let me wake up in your arms
Let me go down in your dreams
There is so much we can do before tomorrow and what tomorrow means
Baby I want to get close to you
Every single word I swear is true
On bended knees, I beg you
Let me wake up in your arms

Nobody wants to sleep alone
