Well, I've run through rainbows
And castles of candy 
I've cried a river of tears
From the pain 

I try to dance with
What life has to hand me 
My partner's been pleasure
My partner's been pain 

There are days
When I swear I could
Fly like an eagle 
And dark desperate hours
That nobody sees 

My arms stretched triumphant
On top of the mountain 
My head in my hands
Down on my knees 

Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze 
Sometimes love's blind
And sometimes it sees 
Sometimes it's roses
And sometimes it's weeds 
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze 

I've reached in darkness
And come out with treasure 
I've laid down with love
And I woke up with lies 

What's it all worth
Only the heart can measure 
It's not what's in the mirror
But what's left inside 

Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze 
Sometimes love's blind
And sometimes it sees 
Sometimes it's roses
And sometimes it's weeds 
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze 

You gotta take it as it comes 
Sometimes it don't come easy 

I've run through rainbows
And castles of candy 
And I've cried a river of tears
From the pain 

I tried to dance with
What life had to hand me 
And if I could
I'd do it all over again 

Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze 
Sometimes love's blind
And sometimes it sees 
Sometimes it's roses
And sometimes it's weeds 
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze

Sometimes the picture
Just ain't what it seems 
You get what you want
But it's not what you need 
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze 

Well it's a breeze
It's a breeze, it's a breeze
