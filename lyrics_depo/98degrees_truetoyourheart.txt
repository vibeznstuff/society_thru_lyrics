Baby, I knew at once
That you were meant for me
Deep in my soul I know
That I'm your destiny
Though you're unsure
Why fight the tide
Don't think so much
Let your heart decide

Baby, I see your future
And it's tied to mine
I look in your eyes
And see you searching for a sign
But you'll never fall
'Til you let go
Don't be scared
Of what you don't know


True to your heart
You must be true to your heart
That's when the heavens will part
And baby, shower you with my love
Open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies
And when you're true to your heart
I know it's gonna lead you straight to me

Someone you know is on your side
Can set you free
I can do that for you
If you believe in me
Why second guess
What feels so right
Just trust your heart
And you'll see the light




You know it's true
Your heart knows what's good for you
Let your heart show you the way
It'll see you through

Girl, your heart is driving me
To where you are
Well, you can take both hands off the wheel
And still get far
Be swept away
Enjoy the ride
You won't get lost
With your heart to guide you




When things are getting crazy
And you don't know where to start
Keep on believing, baby
Just be true to your heart
When all the world around you
It seems to fall apart
Keep on believing, baby
Just be true to your heart
