Oh hold me

Body would I love 2 share oh

But then I wake up

Steal a star down from the sky
Write a song 4 birds 2 sing

Just 1 thing
Hold my body tight
All night
Never let me go
Hold my body tight
All night

Need someone 2 take me home
Talk until the morning light
Don't wanna do ya

Steal a star down from the sky
Write a song 4 birds 2 sing
All I ask of u yeah

Hold my body tight
All night

So come and put them arms around me
Hold me real close
Like an aura
Surround meI need 2 feel ya body
The warmth of ya skin
I need 2 know the beauty
The secret within
And while another would be penetrating
I'll still be stimulating
Contemplating on a vision vibrating
Waiting with the key
2 set your feelings free
Watcha gonna do 4 me
'CosI'd do anything 4 u
Steal a star down from the sky
Write a song 4 birds 2 sing
All I ask of u yeah
Just 1 thing baby
