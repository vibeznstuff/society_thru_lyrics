I'll always think of you
Inside of my private thoughts
I can imagine you
Touching my private parts
With just the thought of you
I can't help but touch my self
That's why I want you so bad
Just one night of
Moonlights, with you there beside me
All night, doin' it again and again
You know I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Oooh I get so high
When I'm around you baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise
You're makin me high

Can't get my mind off you
I think I might be obsessed
The very thought of you
Makes me want to get uhdressed
I wanna be with you
In spite of that my heart says
I guess I want you to bad
All i want is
Moonlights, with you there inside me
All night, doin it again and again
You know i want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Oooh I get so high
When I'm around you baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise
You're makin me high
Baby, baby, baby, baby

I want to feel your heart and soul iside of me
Let's make a deal you roll, I lick
And we can go flying into ecstasy
Oh Darlin' you and me
Light my fire
Blow my flame
Take me, take me, take me away
