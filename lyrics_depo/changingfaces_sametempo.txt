Gotta take our time, take our time 
Gotta take our time, take our time 

Can't comprehend it baby 
Why I feel this way 
I think about you boy 
Till the point it's buggin' me 
It brought about this 
Kinda unexpected energy 
I never knew 
I had inside of me 

I need you to understand 
I intend to make you my man 
You just gotta realize 
This is not a game, it's how I feel inside 

So we better 

Take our time 
Baby cause it's only right 
We just need to take it slow 
So that we can both flow, on the same tempo 

Take our time 
Baby cause it's only right 
We just need to take it slow 
So that we can both flow, on the same tempo 

No matter how I try 
I just can't deny (whoop whoop) 
The way you make me feel 
Wit' ya sex appeal (whoop whoop) 
You got what I want 
Everything I like (whoop whoop) 
You take all of me 
With no sympathy (whooooo) 

I want you to understand 
I intend to make you my man 
You just gotta realize 
This is not a game, it's how I feel inside

Whatever you want baby 
Whatever you need baby (whoop whoop) 
I'll make you slow down 
No matter what I'll be around baby (whooo) 
You can trust me 
Satisfaction guaranteed (whoop whoop) 
Anytime and anyplace 
I'm into you and only you (whoooo)
