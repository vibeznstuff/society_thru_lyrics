I used to hear the voices through the thin walls
Tension building up and I'd feel so small
Some nights I'd hide under the pillows 'cause I didn't know what else to do
Started singing just to get some attention
A melody to cut through the addiction
And every song I made turned into wishes
Some of them came true

Everyone rises, everyone falls
Everyone spends some nights alone
Rich or for poor
I'm always yours
You never left me on my own

Tell me who, who would I be without you?
No matter how much we lose
Every time I bet my life on you

We were never rich not even thousands
Mom was on her knees cleaning houses
I used to go to work with her some days
And dream and dance in the big hallways

Everyone's scared, everyone's scarred
Everyone spends some nights alone
But every high, every low
You never left me on my own

Tell me who, who would I be without you?
No matter how much we lose
Every time I bet my life on you

Tell me who, who would I be without you?
Nothing I'd rather do
Every night I bet my life on you
Who would I be without you?

Went on the road to make my daddy proud
But I lost him and so I sang to the crowd
My only hope is that he's looking down thinking
"Oh my God, my daughter's doing it now"

Tell me who, who would I be without you?
No matter how much we lose
Every time I bet my life on you

Tell me who, who would I be without you?
Nothing I'd rather do
Every night I bet my life on you
Who would I be without you?
