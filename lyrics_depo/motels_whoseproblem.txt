Going together so well
Watching the distance dissolve
Anticipating the matter will never be heard
I know you wanted perfection
But I lost my nerve

So, whose problem am I?
Whose problem am I?
Whose problem am I?
If I'm not yours
You didn't have to help me
You could have very well left me
Out on the floor

Knowing that time always tells
I find that you're not so sure of myself
I think you're wondering maybe you made a mistake
Now, nobody's perfect
Now, why don't you give me a break?

'Cause whose problem am I?
Whose problem am I?
Whose problem am I?
If I'm not yours
You didn't have to adopt me
You could have very well left me
Outside your door

So, whose problem am I?
Whose problem am I?
Whose problem am I?
If I'm not yours
You didn't have to help me
You could have left me
Just like before

I think of the places I visit
I think of the face I have lost
Think of it, I'd be a bargain
At half the cost
And except for the sanity
Nothing much has been lost

So, whose problem am I?
Whose problem am I?
Whose problem am I?
If I'm not yours
You didn't have to adopt me
You could have very well left me
Outside your door
