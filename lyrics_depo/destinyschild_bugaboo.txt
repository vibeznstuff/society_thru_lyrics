You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
tell MCI to cut the phone calls
break my lease so i can move
cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo
i wanna put your number on the call block
have AOL make my emails stop
cause you a bug a boo
you buggin what? you buggin who? you buggin me!
and dont you see it aint cool


its not hot that you be callin me
stressin me pagin my beeper
you're just non-stop and its not hot
that you be leavin me messages every 10 minutes and then you stop by
when i first met you, you were cool
but it was game you had me fooled
cause 20 minutes after i gave you my number
you already had my mailbox full 


so what you bought a pair of shoes
what now i guess you think i owe you
you dont have to call as much as you do
i'd give em back to be through with you
and so what my momma likes you
what now i guess you think i will too
even if the pope he said he likes you too
i dont really care cause you're a bug a boo 




its not hot that when in blockin your phone number
you call me from over your best friends house
and its not hot that i cant even go out with my girlfriends
without you trackin me down
you need to chill out with that mess
cause you cant keep havin me stressed
cause everytime my phone rings it seems to be you
and im prayin that it is someone else 





when you call me on the phone you're buggin me
when you follow me around you're buggin me
everything you do be buggin me
you buggin me, you buggin me
when you show up at my door you're buggin me
when you open up your mouth you're buggin me
everytime i see your face you're buggin me
you're buggin me your buggin me
