When you're walkin' down the street
And the man tries to get your business
And the people that you meet
Want to open you up like Christmas
You gotta wrap your fuzzy with a big red bow
Ain't no sum bitch gonna treat me like a ho
I'm a classy honey kissy huggy lovey dovey ghetto princess

Cause you're filthy Oooh, and I'm gorgeous 
You're disgusting Oooh, and you're nasty
And you can grab me oooh, cause you're nasty

When you're runnin' from a trick
And you trip on a hit of acid
You gotta work for the man
But your biggest moneymakers' flaccid
You gotta keep your shit together
With your feet on the ground
There ain't no one gonna listen
If you haven't made a sound
You're an acid junkie college flunky dirty puppy daddy bastard

Cause you're filthy Oooh, and I'm gorgeous 
You're disgusting Oooh, and you're nasty
And you can grab me oooh, cause you're nasty

Cause you're filthy, oooh, and I'm gorgeous
Cause you're filthy, oooh, and I'm gorgeous
You're disgusting, oooh, and you're nasty
And you can grab me, oooh, cause you're nasty
