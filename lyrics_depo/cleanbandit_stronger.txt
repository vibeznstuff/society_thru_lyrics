People tell me to be cautious
People tell me not to lose my self control
People tell me to be flawless
People tell me not to let myself evolve

And I think I don't really get it
I think it's all just a peculiar game
And soon I'll wake up and I'll forget it
And everyone will know me by a different name

I wanted to be stronger
I wanted to be everything for you
If I could be stronger would you believe
That I could love you like you want me to?

Love me like you want me to
Like you want me to
Love me like you want me to
Like you want me to

I held my breath every time
I tried to keep myself dry
But did I ask too much?
If I could do it again
Would you believe what I said
That I still want that rush

And I think I don't really get it
I think it's all just a peculiar game
And soon I'll wake up and I'll forget it
And everyone will know me by a different name

I wanted to be stronger
I wanted to be everything for you
If I could be stronger would you believe
That I could love you like you want me to?

I want to be strong for you
(Love me like you want me to, like you want me to)
I want to be strong for you
(Love me like you want me to)
I want to be strong for you
And I can, yes I can
If only you could promise that you will try too
I'll be there, I'll be there

I want to be strong for you
If only you could promise that you will try too
I'll be there, I'll be there

I wanted to be stronger
I wanted to be everything for you
If I could be stronger would you believe
That I could love you like you want me to?

I wanted to be stronger
I wanted to be everything for you
If I could be stronger would you believe
That I could love you like you want me to?

Love me like you want me to
Like you want me to
Love me like you want me to
Like you want me to
