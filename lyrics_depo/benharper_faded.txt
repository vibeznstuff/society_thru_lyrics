You so easily amuse
like a pantomime
such a silent crime

You so easily abuse
lack of confidence
it's your best offense

You so easily confuse
you can't deny it
still you try to hide it

Faded
so faded
like a memory gone
there's no recollection
Faded
so faded
like a forgotten dream
further than it seems

You so hastily defy 
when you think you need it
you find a way to bleed it

You so hastily deny
pleading innocence
it's your best defense

You so hastily reply
the moment that you said it
already regret it

Faded
so faded
like a memory gone
there's no recollection
Faded
so faded
like a forgotten dream
further than it seems
