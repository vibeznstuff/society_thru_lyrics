If want something done, gotta do it yourself

Yeah, I think this is gonna be another one of those funky ones
Heart &amp; soul, da da dance

If I was you, and you were me, you'd wanna be winnin'
If you want somethin' bad, yo, you gotta wanna give your all
'Cause I believe so much in we and no we're not kiddin'
If you feel the same as me, yo, you gotta want to take the ball

Now I found out that nothin' is given
Don't know where the cards may fall
All I know is that we've gotta get it
We've gotta make it on our own

Well I guess we're gonna have to take control
(All on our own)
If it's up to us, we've got to take it home
(All on our own)

Now can't you see that all we need to be a go getter
Gotta make your own decisions, you gotta go for what you know
It comes a time in our lives, you wanna be bigger
Gotta keep keep on pushing, you gotta learn to take control, yeah

Now I found out that nothin' is given
Don't know where the cards may fall
All I know is that we've gotta get it
We've gotta make it on our own

Well I guess we're gonna have to take control
(All on our own)
If it's up to us, we've got to take it home
(All on our own)

Gotta, gotta, take it home, gotta, gotta, gotta take it home

Heart &amp; soul, da da dance

Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
They're called the Ghost busters and they're in control
Had 'em throwin' a party for a bunch of children
While all of the while the slime was under the building

So they packed up their group, got a grip, came equipped
Grabbed they Proton packs off their back and they split
Found about Vigo, the master of evil
Try to battle my boys? That's not legal

(Oh-we-oh)
They're in control
(Oh-we-oh)
Ya ya ya know it
(All on our own)

I said, they're in control
(Oh-we-oh)
Ya ya ya know it
(Oh-we-oh)
Ya ya ya know it
(All on our own)

Well I guess we're gonna have to take control
(All on our own)
We got, we got, we got
We got, we got, we got

If it's up to us, we've got to take it home
(All on our own)
Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
They're the Ghost busters and they're in control

Well I guess we're gonna have to take control
(All on our own)
Gotta, gotta, take it home
Gotta, gotta take it home

If it's up to us, we've got to take it home
(All on our own)
Gotta, gotta, take it home
Gotta, gotta, gotta take it home

Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
They're called the Ghost busters and they're in control
Had 'em throwin' a party for a bunch of children
While all of the while the slime was under the building

So they packed up their group, got a grip, came equipped
Grabbed they Proton packs off their back and they split
Found about Vigo, the master of evil
Try to battle my boys? That's not legal
