Even now in heaven there were angels carrying savage weapons

An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
Run, run, run
But you sure can't hide

Does our ruin benefit to earth?
Does it help the grass to grow?
The sun to shine?
Is this darkness in you too?
Have you'd passed through this night?

Run, run, run
But you sure can't hide

Where you're going you're not coming back from

Run, run, run
But you sure can't hide

An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
Run, run, run
But you sure can't hide

This great evil
Where's it come from?
Had still the end of the world?
Who's doing this?
Who's killing us?
Mocking us with the sight of what we might have known

Run, run, run

An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
Run, run, run
But you sure can't hide

Are you righteous?
Kind?
Does your confidence lie in this?
Are you loved by all? 
Do you imagine your suffering will be any less
because you loved goodness and truth?

An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
Run, run, run
But you sure can't hide

What are you to me?
