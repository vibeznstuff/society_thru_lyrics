Laid back 
Laid back 
Laid back, we'll give you laid back 
Laid back 
Laid back 
Laid back, I'll give you laid back 

Over and over and over and over and over 
Like a monkey with a miniature cymbal 
The joy of repetition really is in you 
Under and under and under and under and under 
The smell of repetition really is on you 
And when I feel this way I really am with you 

Laid back 
Laid back 
Laid back, I'll give you laid back 

Over and over and over and over and over 
Like a monkey with a miniature cymbal 
The joy of repetition really is in you 
Under and under and under and under and under 
The smell of repetition really is on you 
And when you look this way I really am with you 

Started thinking about what I to have to do (tell you) 
I got to thinking that I mean just what you do (tell you) 
Started thinking about what I to have to do (tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you)
