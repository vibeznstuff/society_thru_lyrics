For all you know we're broken pieces 
I'm finding it hard to live with someone that won't last
For all you know, you're still my weakness 
I'm finding it hard to fake a smile that I once had

Hold on, I've got a feeling like this is almost over
Hold on, I've got a feeling like we're almost done
We don't need this anymore
We don't need this anymore

We're both waiting for the moment 
When one or the other cuts the light and locks the door 
But in this limbo where we're frozen 
We're not going anywhere, we're not who we were before

Hold on, I've got a feeling like this is almost over
Hold on, I've got a feeling like we're almost done
We don't need this anymore
We don't need this anymore
We don't need this anymore
We don't need this anymore

I've given everything 
I've given everything 
I've given everything 
And it's over
I've given everything 
I've given everything 
I've given everything 
And it's gone

Hold on, I've got a feeling like this is almost over
Hold on, I've got a feeling like we're almost done
We don't need this anymore
We don't need this anymore
We don't need this anymore
We don't need this anymore

Hold on, I've got a feeling like this is almost over
