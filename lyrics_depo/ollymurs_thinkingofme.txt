Winter time in London are you making plans
Are you still rocking converse with your old Raybans
If you’re sitting in the places that we used to be
Or if you’re somewhere listening to Bob Marley
Then I know that you’re somewhere thinking of me

Do you still pick up the seashells on that pebble beach
Remember when that crab came up and pinched your feet
When that old guy gave us all those drinks for free
Do you still get knocked down by that Bacardi breeze

Then I know that you’re somewhere thinking of me
(Oh yes you are)
Then I know that you’re somewhere thinking of me
(oh uh yeh yeah)

No point regretting that it didn’t last
No point regretting that it went so fast
Time that we had was like sand in our hand

But when I look behind
I’m so glad that you were mine

I remember taking you home on that 86
Standing in your doorway where we used to kiss
Then your Dad came out and chased me down the street
If you remember just how scared I used to be

Then I know that you’re somewhere thinking of me

I know wherever you go
that you’ll be thinking about me now
I know wherever you go
that you’ll be thinking about me

Bumped into Irene down in waterloo
She told me that you got yourself somebody new
She said you musta like him cos he’s oh so nice
But I remember that you like a pinch of spice

Well I
I know wherever you go
that you’ll be thinking about me now
I know wherever you go
that you’ll be thinking about me now
I know wherever you go
that you’ll be thinking about me now
