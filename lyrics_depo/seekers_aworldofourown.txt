Close the doors, light the lights.
We're stayin' home tonight,
Far away from the bustle and the bright city lights.
Let them all fade away.
Just leave us alone. 
And we'll live in a world of our own.

We'll build a world of our own 
That no one else can share.
All our sorrows we'll leave far behind us there.
And I know you will find
There'll be peace of mind
When we live in a world of our own.

Oh my love, oh my love,
I cried for you so much.
Lonely nights without sleeping while I longed for your touch.
Now your lips can erase
The heartache I've known.
Come with me to a world of our own.

We'll build a world of our own
That no one else can share.
All our sorrows we'll leave far behind us there.
And I know you will find 
There'll be peace of mind
When we live in a world of our own.

We'll build a world of our own 
That no one else can share.
All our sorrows we'll leave far behind us there.
And I know you will find 
There'll be peace of mind
When we live in a world of our own.

And I know you will find 
There'll be peace of mind
When we live in a world of our own!
