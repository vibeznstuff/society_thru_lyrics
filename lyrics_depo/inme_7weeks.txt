Go

So your still the same, there's nothing left in me
Do you really think that we could save this?
Now get off your feet and really do something
Do you really think it matters anyway?

You said that we were fine, your lying all this time
Your the thorn that's in my side
7 weeks go by, it's so hard to say goodbye
Take your thorn

Take your pills so you can feel more of this and more of me
Don't slam that door in my face
Do you really it matters?
Do you really think it matters anyway?

You said that we were fine, your lying all this time
Your the thorn that's in my side
7 weeks go by, it's so hard to say goodbye
Take your thorn out of my side

My side, my side
Take your thorn out of my side
My side, my side
Take your thorn out of my side

You said that we were fine, your lying all this time
Your the thorn that's in my side
7 weeks go by, it's so hard to say goodbye
Take your thorn out of my side
