Well I been breaking it down for you baby,
Been running around, I can't see no love for me,
Somebody rescue me

I'm the king of the town Mr crazy,
Creating a sound, but still no love for me,
Somebody rescue me,
Just rescue me,
Rescue me,
Rescue me

They call me S... K... E.PTA,
Before I start I just wanna say,
Boy Better Know all day,
I got bumble bee's tryin to figure out how I got this buzz,
All I want is a kiss and a hug but somebody told specsavers I still can't see no love,
Days, month, years, blood, sweat, tears,
I walk the street of london facing my fears,
And everydays like truth or dare,
So spin that bottle,
Cus if it lands on me, I'm a stay true to my word,
I don't want anymore respect than I deserve

Well I been breaking it down for you baby,
Been running around I can't see no love for me,
Somebody rescue me

I'm the king of the town Mr crazy
Creating the sound, there's still no love for me,
Somebody rescue me,
Just rescue me,
Rescue me,
Rescue me

Trust, no ceiling, no doors, I walk all over the beat,
No floors I tell a hater I love you loads,
Tell a supporter I love you more,
And they say I've changed, I say I'm making a change,
I left the road, made a brand new lane,
Still I get no thank you, no round of applause,
So I keep on driving, I'm upset but I keep on smiling,
And when I get knocked down I get back on my two feet and I keep on fighting,
I sacrifice all privacy so I can live my dream what a irony,
Cus now my reality is far from the place I would like to be,

Well I been breaking it down for you baby,
Been running around I can't see no love for me
Somebody rescue me

I'm the king of the town Mr crazy
Creating the sound
There's still no love for me
Somebody rescue me
Just rescue me
