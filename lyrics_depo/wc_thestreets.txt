Yea..
Turn the music up a little bit...
 Dah-dah-daaah
Uh, yea

Lah-dah-daaah
A little bit louder.. right there

Dah-dah-daaah
 In the name of the streets

Click click bu ya! Dub kicked the frame in (uh huh)
Nigga let the games begin, as I standin'
Tossed the tall can on a campus off the limital
scanners takin' penitentiary chances
Sick wit it, off the ric wit it
Blue beenie knitted; freshly acquitted
Grind-grimey, the big body and the big body
Wit lyrics and 'draulics hotter than the Majave
Sellin', brubble bellin', career felon
Escalade 3-braid beer wearin'
Fuck it, I thug for free and thug to eat
Niggas call me "Home of Cake" cause I love the cheese
Gangstas, hustlas, pimps, if ya follow me
Let me see ya put them hands up like a robbery
I solemnly swear to stay down and slang the seed
I spit in the name of the streets


I'm gonna roll (I'm gonna roll)
I'm gon' stay fly (I'm gonna stay fly)
I'm gonna bust (I'm gonna bust)
Hold my hood up high (throw my hood up high)
In the name of the streets
I'm gonna roll (I'm gonna roll)
I'm gon' rich ride (I'm goin' rich ride)
I'm gonna ball (I'm gonna ball)
Hold my hood up high
In the name of the streets

This is for them geniuz
Da best is my East niazz
Both sides street niazz
This is for them DJ's coast to coast movin' this
Spin-ni-nin them turntables that bomp the Ruvian
Smashous, best trap us for cash and dump a blunt at ya's
Outta the mix-classes, this is for them riders, ridin' for the mims
Ghetto ass niazz on them big shiny rims (uh huh)
Thrashin', you're back at ya, bring a debassa'
Got dropping on your drastic, another hood classic
Dump the "Ghetto Heisman" singing "more cabbage"
A street niazz livin' on seek and kill status
Unlock the racked Def Jam cock it back
Recess is over, I want my spot back
Who's the next? I preceded to blow coming at 'em
I'm in a mink coat and Spacey gat 'em
You're lookin' at 'em




I told a woman I don't love her but she wants to go
I told another that I want her but she wants to hoe
I ain't a hater I'm a player so I fucked 'em both
In the name of the streets

 Dah-dah-daaah
Yea...

Lah-dah-daaah
Dub-C...

Dah-dah-daaah
The "Ghetto Heisman"...
 In the name of the streets
Swangin' through a hood near you
 Dah-dah-daaah

Lah-dah-daaah

Dah-dah-daaah
 In the name of the streets
