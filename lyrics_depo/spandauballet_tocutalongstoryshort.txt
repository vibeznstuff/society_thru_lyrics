Soldier is turning 
See him through white light
Running from strangers
See you in the valley 

War upon war
Heat upon heat
To cut a long story short 
I lost my mind

Sitting on a park bench
Years away from fighting
To cut a long story short 
I lost my mind

Standing in the dark
Oh I was waiting for man to come
I am beautiful and clean
And so very very young

To be standing in the street
To be taken by someone

Questions questions
Give me no answers
That's all they ever give me
Questions questions

Oh look at the strange boy
He finds it hard existing
To cut a long story short 
I lost my mind

To cut a long story short
I lost my...
Mi-i-i-i-ind!
