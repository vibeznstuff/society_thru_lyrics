Ooh, na na ay
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na ay
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na ay
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na ay
You don't know me

Oh yeah, time is money so don't fuck with mine
See I'm out with my girls, I'm a have a good time
Step back with your chit-chat, killin' my vibe

See, I can't get too much of a good thing
S'why me a dressed up in the finest things
Well, please hold your tongue, oh, don't say a damn thing

Mmmmmmmm
See your iPhone camera flashin'
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin'
"You here for long?" Oh no, I'm just passin'
"Do you wanna drink?" No, thanks for askin'

Ooh, na na ay
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na ay
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na ay
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na ay
You don't know me, fuck yeah
Ooh, na na ay
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na ay
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na ay
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na ay
You don't know me, fuck yeah

I mean, we could throw shapes together
But it doesn't mean you're in my circle, yeah
Cruise through life and I'm feelin' on track
If you can't keep up, then you better fall back
'Cause money look better when I see it all stacked up

See, I can't get too much of a good thing
S'why me a dressed up in the finest things
Well, please hold your tongue, oh, don't say a damn thing

Mmmmmmmm
See your iPhone camera flashin'
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin'
"You here for long?" Oh no, I'm just passin'
"Do you wanna drink?" No, thanks for askin'

Ooh, na na ay
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na ay
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na ay
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na ay
You don't know me, fuck yeah
Ooh, na na ay
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na ay
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na ay
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na ay
You don't know me, fuck yeah

Do it just slow down
Won't get what you want, what you want, what you want, want
Tell you what you don't know
I get what I want, what I want, what I want, want

Mmmmmmmm
See your iPhone camera flashin'
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin'
