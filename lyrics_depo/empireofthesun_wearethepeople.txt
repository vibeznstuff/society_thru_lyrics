We can remember swimming in December
Heading for the city lights in 1975
We share in each other
Nearer than farther
The scent of a lemon drips from your eyes

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

We lived an adventure
Love in the Summer
Followed the sun till night
Reminiscing other times of life
For each every other
The feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven, got lost in your eyes

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

Can you remember and humanise?
It was still where we'd energised
Lie in the sand and visualise
Like it's '75 again

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

I know everything about you
You know everything about me
We know everything about us

I know everything about you
You know everything about me
We know everything about us

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?


I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?
