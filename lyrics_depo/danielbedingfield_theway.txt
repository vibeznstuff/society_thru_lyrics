To love somebody like you
Would take the rest of my life
This is my revelation
I feel my heart falling off
And give my conscience a knife
This is my reservation

This is the way of the moon
Waxing and wane
Fro-ing and to
This is the way of the Sun
At the end of the day
Night always. comes.
This is the way of my youth
Risking it all
Pursuing the truth
This is the way of the world
My love is changing

I really meant what I said
All of it wasn't a lie
You were the one I wanted
But in the new light of day
Affection started to die
Our house of love was haunted

This is the way of the rains
Evaporate up and falling again
This is the way of her smile
It burns in her eyes but lasts for a while
This is the way of the Earth
The cycle of life
Of dying and birth
This is the way of my heart
My love is changing

Season changes
My life changes
Memory changes
My love changes
System changes
My world changes
Jesus, Jesus never changes

This is the way of the rains
Evaporate up and falling again
This is the way of her smile
It bums in her eyes but lasts for a while
This is the way of the Earth
The cycle of life
Of dying and birth
This is the way of my heart
My love is changing
