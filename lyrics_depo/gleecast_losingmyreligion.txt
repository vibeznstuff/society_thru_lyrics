Life is bigger
It's bigger than you &amp; you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
I've said enough

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think, I thought, I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I've said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think, I thought, I saw you try

That was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think, I thought, I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Try Cry Why Try
That was just a dream
Just a dream
Just a dream
