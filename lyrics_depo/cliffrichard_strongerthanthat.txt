Well I heard you weren't staying
Heard you weren't staying around
That someone has gotten to you
Something 'bout a new kid in town

Well stranger things have happened
Stranger things have happened in love
But the more I think about
The more I see that you are a victim of

Well don't believe everything they say
They're only jealous of you
How people talk when they
Don't know the truth
Don't ever let them get to you

My love is stronger than that
My love is poetry in motion
My love is deeper than that
My love is deeper than the ocean

Well if anyone should harm you
Anyone should get in your way
And you need someone to talk to
Please call me right away

Let them all listen
Listen to the new kid in town
It's the same old story
The story's been around and around

So don't believe everything they say
They're only jealous of you
How people talk when they
Don't know the truth
Don't ever let them tell you what to do

My love is stronger than that
My love is poetry in motion
My love is deeper than that
My love is deeper than the ocean

So don't believe everything they say
They're only jealous of you
How people talk when they
Don't know the truth
Don't ever let them tell you what to do

My love is stronger than that
My love is poetry in motion
My love is deeper than that
My love is deeper than the ocean

My love is stronger than that
My love is poetry in motion
My love is deeper than that
My love is deeper than the ocean
