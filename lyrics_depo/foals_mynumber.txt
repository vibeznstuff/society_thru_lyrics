You don’t have my number, we don’t need each other now
We don’t need the city, the creed or the culture now

'Cause I feel, I feel alive, I feel, I feel alive
I feel the streets are all pulling me down

So people of the city I don’t need your counsel now
And I don’t need your good advice, you don’t have my lover’s touch

You don’t have my number, we don’t need each other now
The creed or the culture, we can move beyond it now

Now the wolf is knocking at my door, bang-banging, ask for more
Stand here, we stand tall, we could move beyond these walls

I don’t need your counsel, I don't need these city streets
I don’t need that good advice 'cause we can move beyond it now

You don’t have my number, we don’t need each other now
The creed or the culture, you don’t have my lover’s touch

'Cause I feel, I feel alive, I feel, I feel alive
I feel the streets are all far from there

Do you even hear me? Do you even know my name?
Can you see the ocean now? You don’t have my lover’s touch
You don’t have my number, you don’t have my number
People, can you hear me? Are you even listening now?

'Cause you don’t have my number, we don’t need each other now
You can't steal my thunder 'cause you don’t have my lover’s touch
You don’t have my number and I don’t need no one else
And I don’t need these city streets, the creed or the culture now
