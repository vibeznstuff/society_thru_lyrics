I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me,
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be.
Open my eyes (yeah).
It was only just a dream.
So I travelled back down that road.
Will she come back? No one knows.
I realize (yeah) it was only just a dream.

I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement.
Number one spot and now she find her a replacement.
I swear now I can't take it, knowing somebody's got my baby.
And now you ain't around, baby, I can't think.
I should've put it down, should've got the ring.
'Cause I can still feel it in the air,
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair.

My lover, my life, my shawty, my wife.
She left me, I'm tied.
'Cause I knew that it just ain't right.

I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me,
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be.
Open my eyes (yeah).
It was only just a dream.
So I travelled back down that road.
Will she come back? No one knows.
I realize (yeah) it was only just a dream.

When I be ridin', man, I swear I see her face at every turn.
Tryna get my Usher over I can't let it burn.
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn for.
More and more I miss her. When will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback.
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby.
Hey, she was so easy to love.
But waitâ€”I guess that love wasn't enough.
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone.
And now I'm missing, wishing she'd pick up the phone.
But she made the decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong.

I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me,
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be.
Open my eyes (yeah).
It was only just a dream.
So I travelled back down that road.
Will she come back? No one knows.
I realize (yeah) it was only just a dream.

If you ever loved somebody put your hands up.
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up.
And now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything.
Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up.
