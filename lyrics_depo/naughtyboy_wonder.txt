I can beat the night
I'm not afraid of thunder
I am full of light
I am full of wonder

Wo-oh, oh-oh, I ain't falling under
Wo-oh, oh-oh, I am full of wonder

Though our feet might ache
The world's upon our shoulders
No way we gon' break
Cause we are full of wonder

Wo-oh, oh-oh, we ain't falling under
Wo-oh, oh-oh, we are full of wonder

This light is contagious
Go, go tell your neighbors
Just reach out and pass it on, ooh, yeah
This light is contagious
Go, go tell your neighbors
Just reach out and pass it on, ooh, yeah
This light is contagious
Go, go tell your neighbors
Just reach out and pass it on, ooh, yeah
This light is contagious
Go, go tell your neighbors
Just reach out and pass it on, yeah

Wo-oh, oh-oh, we ain't falling under
Wo-oh, oh-oh, we are full of wonder

When everything feels wrong
And darkness falls upon you
Just try sing along
This is a message from Cabana

If your heart turns blue
I want you to remember
This song is for you
And you are full of wonder

Wo-oh, oh-oh, we ain't falling under
Wo-oh, oh-oh, we are full of wonder

Wo-oh, oh-oh, we ain't falling under
Wo-oh, oh-oh, we are full of wonder
