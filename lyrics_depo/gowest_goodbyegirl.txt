Footsteps echo on familiar streets
Crossing bridges, never burned
I am tired of playing hide and seek
Is this all that I have learned?

Looking for a diamond in the dark
I was sure you were the one
You held me spell bound
While you made your mark
Now, the damage has been done

Goodbye girl, it's a game
We play every time we say
Goodbye girl, you hypnotize
I can't say goodbye

I'm afraid when I turn out the light
Words you say while you're asleep
Where you were and what you did last night?
Those are secrets you can keep, yeah

Goodbye girl, it's a game
We play every time we say
Goodbye girl, you hypnotize
I can't say goodbye

Tied to you, blood on the wire
Don't you know you've pushed me much too far?
Just who do you think you are?
I can't escape, must almost need you around
Every time I say goodbye, you hypnotize

Footsteps echo on familiar streets
Crossing bridges, never burned
I am tired of playing hide and seek, yeah
Is this all that I have learned?

Goodbye girl, it's a game
We play every time we say
Goodbye girl, you hypnotize my eyes

Goodbye girl, it's a game
We play every time we say
Goodbye girl, you hypnotize
I can't say goodbye

Goodbye girl, it's a game
We play every time we say
Goodbye girl, you hypnotize my eyes

Goodbye girl, it's a game
We play every time we say
Goodbye girl, you hypnotize
I can't say goodbye
