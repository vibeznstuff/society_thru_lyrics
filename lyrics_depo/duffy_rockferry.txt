I'd move to Rockferry,
Tomorrow
And I'd build my house, baby
With sorrow

I'd leave my shadow,
To fall behind
And I wouldn't write to you
'cos I'm not that kind

The midnight trains are boarding
All wrap up 8s
I pich my load and i fill my truck
before its too late

I leave the stars to judge
my every move
I'm not going to think of you, oh
I'd get the blues

Theres no sleep on the journey
away from time
A bag of songs and a heavy heart
won't make me down

i'll give it all my strength and my mind
i'll make this decision with or without

I'd move to Rockferry,
Tomorrow
And I'd build my house, baby
With sorrow

I'd leave my shadow,
To fall behind
And i wouldn't write to you
'cos i'm not that kind
not that kind

Rockferry, not that kind
