No, you're not alone
'Cause everybody's out there on their own
But you, one of the scene
Tryin' to be like no ones ever been

And everybody knows that
That's the way it goes
And that's alright with me
I've got time

You try so hard, you get it wrong
You can't deny the feeling's gone
It's time you got the look that you need

So, keep holding on
And time will come, you'll jump right up
And find you're back on top of the world
Sure in time you'll be heard, you said

?Come on everybody
Knows you're meant for better
And say what you mean
Or you won't mean a thing to me?

Come on everybody
Ignores you now
But soon your time will come
Yeah, they'll know who you are

No, you're not alone
'Cause everyone who's out there's on there own
But you were always the same
Tryin' to be like no ones ever been

You try so hard, you get it wrong
You can't deny, the feeling's gone
It's time you took a look at what you need

So, keep holding on
And time will come, you'll jump right up
And find you're back on top of the world
Sure in time you'll be heard, you said

?Come on everybody
Knows you're meant for better
And say what you mean
Or you won't mean a thing to me?

Come on everybody
Ignores you now
But soon your time will come

You're on top of the world
Sure in time you'll be heard, you said

?Come on everybody
Knows you're meant for better
And say what you mean
Or you won't mean a thing to me"

Come on everybody
Ignores you now
But no, it's not the end of the world
Sure in time you'll be heard, you said

?Come on everybody
You know you're meant for better?
