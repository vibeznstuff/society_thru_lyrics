Stay with me for just one more day

I have to make a move to somewhere miles away
The only hope we've got is just to smile and pray

Give into your desire, say goodbye or play with fire, play with fire you'll get burned
Another lesson learned

It's time I have to fly and then you say those precious words

Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me for just one more day
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me for just one more day

You make me lose my focus and the time of day
Just one minute in your arms, the night, it flies away

It's time I have to fly and then you say those precious words

Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me for just one more day
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me for just one more day

I'm falling for you, you've fallen for me
Stay with me, stay with me for just one more day
I'm falling for you, you've fallen for me
Stay with me, stay with me for just one more day

Oh I think loving you could be so easy
Oh I think loving you could be so easy

I rate that heavenly girl, she's a keeper
Should be taking her home, make it deeper
Take that leisurely stroll by the beach
Then I've gotta leave country, now apply Visa
I'm gonna bottle our love, take a litre
See you in a couple of weeks
We're like a couple of freaks in Ibiza
Even if we're sat on the sofa, you just won me over

Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me for just one more day
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me for just one more day

I'm falling for you, you've fallen for me
Stay with me, stay with me for just one more day
I'm falling for you, you've fallen for me
Stay with me, stay with me for just one more day
