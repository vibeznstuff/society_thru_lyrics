Already know that I'm on it
She's more than something special so...

Rock with me
Baby, tell me will you rock with me?
Rock with me
‘Cause baby can't nobody rock like me

I be checking for you long time
You look good under the strobe light
But even better in the sunlight
Windows down with the radio on
Come ride
Tonight
Don't deny feelings you feel
Just keep trill
Baby tell me what's the deal

Girl it could be you and me, let’s ride
Yea it could be you and me, on fire

Rock with me
Baby, tell me will you rock with me?
Rock with me
‘Cause baby can't nobody rock like me

Tryna rock the boat baby hold tight
Girl we on the roll
Don't let this moment go
Tryna take you down like a low tide
It'll change your life baby
So just ride
Tonight
Don't deny feelings you feel
Just keep trill
Baby tell me what's the deal

Girl it could be you and me, let’s ride
Yea it could be you and me, on fire

Rock with me
Baby, tell me will you rock with me?
Rock with me
‘Cause baby can't nobody rock like me


Rock with me baby
Show me what you all about
I'mma pick you up
I'mma take you out
See the whole bay from Indian Rock
You know you into me
It’s funny you pretending you not
I see the truth in your eyes
I see its deep in your heart
Know you read thru the lies
You pick them people apart
Tell them lames go head keep actin
We relaxin', blastin', T. Jackson

Girl it could be you and me, let’s ride
Yea it could be you and me, on fire

Rock with me
Baby, tell me will you rock with me?
Rock with me
‘Cause baby can't nobody rock like me
