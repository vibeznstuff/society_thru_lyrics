She wears those micromini dresses
Hair hanging down her back

She wears those see through sweaters
She likes to wear her stocking black
And if I see her tonight

You can bet your life I'll attack.

She got beautiful teeth

A toothpaste adman's dream.
She got a beautiful form
The best I've ever seen.
I' gonna get her tonight

I don't care where she been.

Well
I said baby
baby

Baby what you doin' to me.
I said baby
baby

Baby what you doin' to me.
I said baby
baby

Baby jump into my dream.

I dream that she was Lady Chatterley'n
I was the game keeper.
I dream that I was Da Vinci and
She was the Mona Lisa.
I dream that I was Humbert and
She was Lolita.

I said baby
baby

baby what you doin' to me.
I said baby
baby

baby what you doin to me.
I said baby
baby

Baby jump into my dream.
