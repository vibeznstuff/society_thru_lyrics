Rising like the smoke
You linger on me
You got me so high
I can finally breathe
You're walking poetry,
It's what you do to me
It's what you do to me
Touch me with no hands
Hold me with your eyes
Unwind me with your mind tonight
Speak with no words
Show me and I'm all yours
Show me and I'm all yours


All that you are
Is all that I need
Rising like the smoke
You linger on me
All that you are
Is all that I need
Rising like the smoke
You linger on me

You got me so high, I can finally breathe your
Finally breathe your, finally breathe
You got me so high, I can finally breathe your
Finally breathe your, finally breathe

And I'm all yours, all yours
And I'm all yours, show me
I'm all yours, all yours
I'm all yours

All that you are
Is all that I need
Sunset in your eyes
Light me with your loving
I'm searching for the thrill
It's you, you make me feel
You make me feel
Touch me with no hands
Hold me with your eyes
Unwind me with your mind tonight
Speak with no words
Show me and I'm all yours
Show me and I'm all yours


All that you are
Is all that I need
Rising like the smoke
You linger on me
All that you are
Is all that I need
Rising like the smoke
You linger on me

You got me so high, I can finally breathe your
Finally breathe your, finally breathe
You got me so high, I can finally breathe your
Finally breathe your, finally breathe

And I'm all yours, all yours
And I'm all yours, show me
I'm all yours, all yours
I'm all yours
