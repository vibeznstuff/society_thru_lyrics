Mama said 
Don't you play around town 
But I just can't control myself 
Picking up that boy tonight 
Ain't gonna put him down 'til it feels all right 

People stop and stare 
Cuz looking is fair 
Come on over baby let me show you how I care 
It's getting hot in here 
My biorhythm's jumping 
Got my circulation pumping 
We are 

Body to body 
Funk to funky 
We know how to rock your party 
Body to body 
Funky to funky 
We know how 
We know how we're wreckin up your party 

It's physical 
Not just spiritual attraction 
I hear you coming when I ring the dinner bell 
Got my phazer set to stun 
Now we're gonna have some fun 

I got my people up inside 
Baby wanna ride 
Party's fairly jumping but we're gonna have to slide 
I need a miracle 
Turn it up a little higher 
The roof is on fire 
We are 

Body to body 
Funk to funky 
We know how to rock your party 
Body to body 
Funky to funky 
We know how 
We know how we're wreckin up your party 
Body to body 
Funk to funky 
We know how to rock your party 
Body to body 
Funk to funky 
We're coming in your house 
We know how we're wreckin up your party 
Struck out another line 
Making an all time flow 

My mama said 
To get things done 
You gotta go to school 
Ain't gonna have no fun 

My mama said 
You're still too young 
You gotta slow it down 
Ain't gonna have no fun

You're still too young

Ain't gonna have no fun 
No No 

Cos we are
