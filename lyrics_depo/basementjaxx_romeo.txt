You keep on giving me the hold up
You know I wish you'd make your mind up
Cuz when we get it on, you're so-so
You used to be my romeo (woa oh ay oh)
Cuz you see my dear, I have, had enough
Of keeping quiet about all this stuff
You're neurotic like a yo-yo
You used to be my romeo (woa oh ya oh)
Let it all go (woa oh ay oh)
Let it all go (woa oh ay oh)
Let it all go (woa oh ay oh)
Let it all go (woa oh ay oh)
Let it all go

You used to be my romeo

You keep on giving me the hold up
You know I wish you'd make your mind up
Cuz when we get it on you're so-so
You used to be my romeo (woa oh ay oh)
Cuz you see my dear, I have, had enough
Of keeping quiet about all this stuff
You're neurotic like a yo-yo
OH you used to be my romeo
Let it all go (woa oh ay oh)
Let it all go (woa oh ay oh)
Let it all go (woa oh ay oh)
Let it all go (woa oh ay oh)

Let it go oh oh oh
Let it all go
Cuz you left me laying there,
With a broken heart.
Staring though a deep cold void,
Alone in the dark
And I miss the warmth in the morning,
And the laughter when I can't stop yawning
But the tears on the pillow have dried my dear
Gonna let it all go cuz I have no fear

(woa oh ay oh)
Let it all go (woa oh ay oh)
Let it all go (woa oh ay oh)
Let it all go (woa oh ay oh)
Let it all go
My romeo
You used to be my romeo
You used to be my romeo
You used to be my romeo
You used to be my romeo
You used to be my romeo
Let it go oh oh oh
