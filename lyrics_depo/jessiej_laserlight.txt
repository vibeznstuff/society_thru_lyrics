In the blink of an eye
I was falling from the sky
In the blur, you took my breath away
And my heart starts beating
And my lungs start breathing
And the voice in my head starts screaming
I'm alive!

You're like a laserlight, burning down
Burning down, on me
You're like a laserlight, burning down
Burning down, on me

You make me feel good,
You make me feel safe,
You make me feel like I could live another day
You make me feel good,
You make me feel safe,
You know I wouldn't have it any other way

(D-D-D-David G)
(Je-Je-Je-Jessie J)

You and me, face to face
And there's so much I could say
On these words, and forever seem the silence
Can you hear, that box bre-brea-breaking
And the world starts sha-sha-shaking
They keep talking, talking, talking
But we're walking, walking, to the light
Tonight, tonight

You're like a laserlight, burning down
Burning down, on me
You're like a laserlight, burning down
Burning down, on me

You make me feel good,
You make me feel safe,
You make me feel like I could live another day
You make me feel good,
You make me feel safe,
You know I wouldn't have it any other way

Stop...please don't stop...I won't stop
We won't stop... 

In the blink of an eye
I was falling from the sky
In the blur, you took my breath away
