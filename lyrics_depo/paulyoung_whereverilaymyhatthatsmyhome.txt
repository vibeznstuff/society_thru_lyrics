By the look in your eye 
I can tell you're gonna cry
Is it over me?
If it is, save your tears
For I'm not worth it, you see

For I'm the type of boy who is always on the run
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home
I'm telling you that's my home

You had romance
Did you break it by chance
Over me?
If it's so I'd like for you to know
That I'm not worth it, you see

For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home
That's my home

Oh, you keep telling me
You keep telling me I'm your man
What do I have to do to make you understand?

For I'm the type of guy 
Who gives girl the eye
Everybody knows
But I love them and I leave them
Break their hearts and deceive them everywhere I go

Don't you know that I'm the type of man who is always on the roam,
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home

That's my home
And I like it that way
