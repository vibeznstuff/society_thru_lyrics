I believe that together we can really make a difference
One man cannot make a difference
But if we can patern
If we can have a poltic win
This win can really make a difference in our nation
We can really do make a difference in our nation

I believe that together we can really make a different
One man cannot make a difference, but if we can partner
If we can have a collective will, and a willingness to make a difference in our nation
We can really do make a different

What you have done, is put yourself between a bullet and a target
Won't be long, won't be long...

All it took was one in a trillion
In a world where they're gunning civilians
Where conspiracies just drop on us like plummeting buildings
Government villains at night, we are renegades who fight
Under a pilgrims plight for a better way of life
See we sail the seas with a sun stained atlas
To escape the day to day mental mundane madness
That consumes us, it's true, though my real answer lays
Is stepping back to view life's real grand Monet
But crucial issues are lost in this crazy worlds wealth
How can lust for bucks outweigh one baby girl's health?
Through the cyclone we hit the Third World and found heroes
With nothing but still everything, smiling at ground zero

What you've done here, is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before you're pulling yourself away

So let the bullets in the air turn to raining rose petals
That covers the Earth's surface while the children throw pebbles
From dreams to themes, to a crack in the concrete
From a seed to a tree, I make it happen at God speed
Whatever happened to increase the peace
Fight the power for people to defeat the beast
Well it's right here, it's right now
It's anything I plan
It's a poem that proves a point
It's everything I am
So on a rainy day I made my way
To the promised land and back
And now it's safe to say in a crazy way
This song is where it's at
It's equal verse what wasn't given
Teachers verse the problem children
Evil verse the honest living
People verse the politicians

What you've done here, Is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before you're pulling yourself away

This is definite
Like the sun will rise
Pure like the thought if I jump I'll fly
I am revolution, my path is belief
So how can they possibly stop what they can't even see

See they tax the poor
Their evil got em' coughing up
There's no real freedom under a legal modern mafia
Set the goal and unite, get cocked and take aim
The people are the power to make change
So make way

What you've done here, Is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before you're pulling yourself away
