Hey baby
You're driving me crazy
With that special loving feeling
That you give to me
And I'm so proud
You want me to be your lady
Now I know how it feels
To live a fantasy

I used to dream about love
And sure that's how it was
But I don't have to dream no more
'Cause I
I got more than I can stand
I found me a lover in another man
I got you baby
That's all I was waiting for

And I love
The way you love me
I place no one above
I don't want true love
I love
(And I love)
The way you love me
And baby no matter what
I love the
I love the way you love

(Oh oh)
Me
(Oh oh
Oh oh)

Oh baby baby baby
I might as well face it
I've fallen in so deep
You have control of me
Without a doubt
It has to be the greatest
You're every bit the man
I had hoped you'd be

I used to dream about love
And sure that's how it was
But I don't have to dream no more
Oh no
'Cause when I think about your loving
Then I get a good beat
I get excited from the feeling
That it's giving to me
So won't you keep it coming baby
'Cause I love the joy you bring
I, I, I, I love

(And I love
The way you love me)
I love it, love it, love it
(I place no one above)

Me

So don't you stop
I love the way

For all the special love
Two
A sensitive and tender touch
Three
Because you please
You bring out the best in me
'Cause when I think about your loving
Then I get a good beat
