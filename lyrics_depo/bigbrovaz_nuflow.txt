Ladies and Gentlemen:
Boys and girls
It is my pleasure to
introduce to you all
The finest; the brightest;
the meanest; the strongest
The very best of them all
The south London collective group
Known as:
For goodness sake Roger who is it?



This is big bro (bro)
Taking over the show
With this new flow, flow
You need to listen up
And feel this shit, shit
Cause we won’t quit, quit
We make them hits
And stack them chips

It’s Flawless I came for the doe
As soon as I step in the door
I see that you’re hating my glow
The crew, the flow we’re
soon to blow
We’re tired of being this poor
And having to sleep on the floor
And working a 9 to 5
Just like a five-dollar whore
Knowing we’re worth more
We simply had to settle the score,
That’s why you see these albums
And the singles in the store
It’s Big Brovaz baby trying to
cash some major figures
You mess with my cheese and I’ll switch just like Schwazernegger

It’s Dion
I bet you won’t forget my name
I probably maybe gonna
get inside your brain
My family does the same
It’s BB’s time to reign
We’re doing them platinum things
I know you’re not ready for me

You move you lose
Can’t wear my shoes
Cherise brand new
Me and my crew
Don’t try our flow
If your tongue don’t roll
You’ll lose control
We’re just way too cold

Hey yo this is Jay Rock
And I’ve got more
Skill’s then average
Put us together man we’re more than all of yawl can manage
Cause we be the baddest at it
This here took years of practice
And now it’s only more
money and it’s more madness
Stack up on a daily basis,
We’ve travelled so many places
Switching so many chicks were mixing up the names with faces
They see the ice and they trip,
they like to ride in the whip
But all I wanna know is if these girls is riding the ahhhhh

Who’s, who’s, Who’s this!

This is the N.A.D.I you didn’t
think I was coming at ya
Giving you people a different
kind of big brother flava
I bet yawl didn’t think I be riding these beats and making the paper
But I guess that I’m a paper chaser playa and it’s in my nature
