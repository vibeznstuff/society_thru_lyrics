finally through the roof
on to somewhere near
and far in time

where have you been 
finally through the roof
and how does lemur skin
reflect the sea?

we will wade in the shine of the ever
we will wade in the shine of the ever
we will wade in the tides of the summer
every summer
every summer

in California

my velouria
