Work it out, up and down
Sweat it out, make up sex
Twerk it out, up and down
Sweat it out, make up sex

I'm tired, you're wired
Why fight?
It’s just the same thing
Tonight is my final love battle

Cause girl, I'm hungover
Let's just start over
Gotta be more to love than this
We should be naughty
Connect our bodies
You know I'm on it
I'm on my knee

(Let's start it, start it)
Let's start it up
Another shot at love
(Let’s start it, start it)
Can't get enough
(Let’s start it, start it)
We can just
Work it out, up and down
Sweat it out, make up sex
Twerk it out, up and down
Sweat it out, make up sex


I might've lost sight of
Your wants &amp; needs
But I'm done running
From what I, I know I can be, oh

Cause girl, I'm hungover
Let's just start over
Gotta be more to love than this
We should be naughty
Connect our bodies
You know I'm on it
I'm on my knee

(Let's start it, start it)
Let's start it up
Another shot at love
(Let’s start it, start it)
Can't get enough
(Let’s start it, start it)
We can just
Work it out, up and down
Sweat it out, make up sex
Twerk it out, up and down
Sweat it out, make up sex


Let's start it, start it
Let's start it up
Another shot at love
(Let’s start it, start it)
Can't get enough
(Let’s start it, start it)
We can just
Work it out, up and down
Sweat it out, make up sex
Twerk it out, up and down
Sweat it out, make up sex
