Oh Yeaah..... ah ah ah...
Is ah big dance hall song in know
Madzart alongside Kevin Lyttle
You know how it is, you know how we go
You know


For the longest while we jamming in the Party
And you're wining on me
Pushing everything
Right back on top of me (Yea - hey- ai)
But if you think you're gonna get away from me
You better change your mind
You're going home........
You're going home with me tonight
