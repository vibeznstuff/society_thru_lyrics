We've been told to live our lives
Just working on a feeling
Waiting for the sun to shine on what
We do believe in
In every man
I hear the cry of someone else
A drowning man reaching out
But no-one hears
I know a man living out his life
Without a reason 
And he says...


Monday's got a beautiful baby
And Wednesday's child can never win
Little Saturday will work till he's crazy
But Friday's child was born to give

Now what about all the unborn people that will suffer
At the hands of Mr. Right
Who cares about no other
I see a mother who lets her children use her up
I know a father to sacrifices his wayward son
I wonder
What you give that someone else is needing nothing
Next to nothing
