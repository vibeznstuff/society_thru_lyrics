Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
You know I really care
Say you will
Say you dare

An inner feeling comes around
Let it sparkle and let it shine
Let it lift you off the ground
Make it last, baby make it mine

You are the sun that rises
You are the moon that lights at night
You are what paralyses me

Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
You know I really care
Say you will
Say you dare
Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
A love beyond compare
Say you will
Say you care

Write my name into the sky
And keep the memories in your heart
Let the hours pass us by
I guess that this is a way to start

You are full of surprises
You are a fire burning bright
You are what mesmerises me

Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
You know I really care
Say you will
Say you dare
Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
A love beyond compare
Say you will
Say you care

Say you dare...
Say you will...
Say you dare......
No no, no no

Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
You know I really care
Say you will
Say you dare
Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
A love beyond compare
Say you will
Say you care
