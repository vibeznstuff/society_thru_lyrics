Friends
I've got friends

Don't you be ashamed of how you feel when someone
Lends you a helping hand
Because the bottom line is bein' for real in
Every way that you can

Ask yourself, after all that you've learned
Would you do the same thing if the tables were turned
Well, my answer is, "Yes"
'Cause I've been through the test, now I'll never forget my

Friends (You can bet)
I've got friends (My values are with my)
Friends (So glad that I)
I've got friends (And not the fair weather kind)

Whenever I am feelin' down and out, they help me
Get through the rainy day
They lift my spirits and erase my doubts then
Chase those gray clouds away

If I had a dollar for every time
That they have stood by my side helping things turn out right
I would be a millionaire
And my wealth they would share 'cause I'd be nowhere without my

Friends (I'm so glad)
I've got friends (My values are with my)
Friends (I'll tell you I)
I've got friends (And not the fair weather kind)

We share the good and the bad times
Friends, ooh, ooh
Hangin' out, it's no problem, my
Friends, ooh, ooh

And we take up for each other, look out for each other, yes, we do
Ooh, ooh
Said we take up for each other, look out for each other, the way friends do
Ooh, ooh
Hangin' out
Hangin' out
And we take up for each other, look out for each other, yes, we do
Ooh, ooh
Said we take up for each other, look out for each other, the way friends do
Ooh, ooh
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't you be ashamed of how you feel when someone
Lends you a helping hand
Because the bottom line is bein' for real in
Every way that you can

Ask yourself, after all that you've learned
Would you do the same thing if the tables were turned
Well, my answer is, "Yes"
'Cause I've been through the test, now I'll never forget my

Friends (You can bet)
