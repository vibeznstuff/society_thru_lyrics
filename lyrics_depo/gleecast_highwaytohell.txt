Livin' easy, lovin' free, season ticket, on a one way ride
Askin' nothin', leave me be, takin' everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I would rather do
Goin' down, party time, My friends are gonna be there too

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell

No stop signs, speed limit, nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel (ooh), gonna spin it. nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey Satan, payin' my dues (pay my dues), playin' in a rockin' band
Hey Mama, look at me, I'm on my way to the promised land whoa

I'm on the highway to hell (on the highway)
Highway to hell (I'm on a highway to hell)
I'm on the Highway to hell (I'm on it I'm on it)
highway to hell

Ooooh
Dont stop me!

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell! (I'm on the high way to hell)
Highway to hell!
I'm on the highway to hell

highway to hell
On the highway to hell!
Highway to hell!
I'm on the highway to hell

Don't stop me oooh yeah
