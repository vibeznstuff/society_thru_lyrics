Turn me loose 
Break 'em off some
Yeah

Good cop, good cop, rollin' with that bad cop
What you doing, boy, turn in that blood clot
Buck shot shot, they fly through the drug spot
Robots can't give a damn who the fuck's shot

Clean cop, clean cop, fucking with that dirty cop
Don't act like yo ass never heard of that
Clean cop, clean cop, rollin' with that mean cop
Still tryna act proud as a peacock

You know that mean cop might need a detox
Motherfucker tryna blow me out my Reeboks
But I swing like Jack and the Beanstalk
Chop them down, when these bitches tryna lock me down

Hit the ground, hit the turf, walk the earth
Cube kidnap your mind, Patty Hearst
Bust a verse, that'll make your ass hit reverse
Kill the curse that was placed on the universe

West coast war lord
Blacker than the black knight
Fuck a black and white, when they ain't actin' right
Good cop, good cop fillin' out your report
Bad cop asking you to distort

Bad cop asking you to lie in court
Send another young brother up north
Send another young sister off course
While these motherfuckers chill on the golf course

Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the wack cop
Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the wack cop

Lazy cop, fuckin' with that crazy cop
Always bragging 'bout that new case he got
Do or die cop, with that suicide cop
Tell the truth cop with that "You-a-lie" cop

Are you fuckin' high cop? Don't even try cop
Ain't no motherfuckin' drugs up in my spot
All you find in my closet is the high tops,
And my motherfuckin' tickets to the sky box

Hold up nigga (hold up), I'm a rider
Youse a roll up, yep, the controller
Make me mad, that's when I get swole up (don't touch that)
The Incredible Hulk is bipolar

Come out the cuffs, knock off the rust
Throw my hands up, you still wanna bust
The Trojan horse is full of excessive force
When they try get aggressive, niggas off the porch

Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the wack cop
Black police showin' out for the white cop (Turn me loose)
White police showin' out for the wack cop

Good cop, good cop, where is your dignity?
Where's your empathy? Where is your sympathy?
Bad cop, where's your humanity?
Good cop, is that just a fantasy?

Tell on that nigga, snitch on that bitch
Truth be told, motherfuck the blue code
Fuck the po-po actin' like Deebo
Already know Craig a-let the brick go

Black Lives Matter, is not chit chatter
-Cause all they wanna do is scatter brain matter
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
A nine is terrible in your face

The mace has a terrible fuckin' taste
The pen is a terrible fuckin' place
The kings all hate the fuckin' ace
The judge sabotaged my fuckin' case

Racist motherfucker

Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the wack cop
