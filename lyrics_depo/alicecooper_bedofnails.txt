Yeah, we're gonna fight
We do it every night
Baby, when you scratch
You know I'm gonna bite
You can make me die
I can make you cry
Opposites attract
That's the reason why
No one else could make you feel
Like I do, I do, I do
No one else gets that deep inside you
As I do, baby
Our love is a bed of nails
Love hurts good on a bed of nails
I'll lay you down and when all else fails
I'll drive you like hammer on the bed of nails
First we're gonna kiss
Then we're gonna say
Dirty little words
Only lovers say
Rockin'thru the night
Rollin'on the floor
When they hear us screamin'
They'll be breakin'down the door
No one else could make you feel
Like I do, I do, I do
No one else gets that deep inside you
As I do, baby
Our love is a bed of nails
Love hurts good on a bed of nails
I'll lay you down and when all else fails
I'll drive you like hammer on the bed of nails
Bed of nails, Bed of nails
I'll drive you like hammer on the bed of nails
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow
Gonna drive you like hammer
Baby, put me in your slammer, oh yeah
No one else could make you feel
Like I do, I do, I do
No one else gets that deep inside you
As I do, baby
Our love is a bed of nails
Love hurts good on a bed of nails
I'll lay you down and when all else fails
I'll drive you like hammer on the bed of nails
Bed of nails, get on my bed of nails
I'll drive you like hammer on the bed of nails
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow
Gonna drive you like hammer
Baby, put me in your slammer, oh yeah
I'll drive you like hammer on the bed of nails
