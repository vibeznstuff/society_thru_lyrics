I don't care 'bout the color of her hair
Or the color of the skin that she's wrapped in
All I want is a personality
That's right for me
That's all I seek
I don't care if she's rich or poor
The door to my heart is open wide
If you're lonely for someone to love then why don't you just come inside

'Cause I'm girl crazy
Crazy
I'm girl crazy
I'm girl crazy
For a girl crazy
I'm girl crazy
Crazy for a girl who's boy crazy

For a boy like me - oh yeah
I don't care that the clothes that she wears
Isn't amazing or debonair. All I want is love and affection
For whatever direction
I don't care
I don't mind if she can't dance. I'll teach her to dance in every way
And if by chance she's new to romance
I'll teach her to make love night and day

'Cause I'm girl crazy
Crazy
I'm girl crazy
I'm girl crazy
I'll be your lover
I'll be your friend
I'll stay with you darling
Till the very end 'cause

I'm girl crazy
Crazy
I'm girl crazy
I'm girl crazy
I'm girl crazy
Crazy
I'm girl crazy
I'm girl crazy
I'm girl crazy
Crazy
I'm girl crazy
I'm girl crazy
