A little bit more than I ever wanted
A little bit more than you could ever say
Did you really think that I'd forgotten
Kicked out the windshield, water coming in
Fade away, fade away

Push just a little too late
Is this what you want, what you need
Is this what you wanted me to be
Always loved me strapped to you
Lock it down and drive me through

I tried to give more than you thought I'd take now
Taking more than you could ever say
Push come to shove, you kicked me in the head
You knock me down, I ripped the handle off again
I wanted more than this, wanted more than this
Fade away, fade away

Push just a little too late
Is this what you want, what you need
Is this what you wanted me to be
Always loved me strapped to you
Lock it down and drive me through

Hands gripped to the wheel held too tight to feel
Face pressed to the glass, please don't ask
One more breath, one more, it's alright
I could never give enough, have enough, be enough
You could never stand to stay there
Only, only, only
Fade away, fade away

Push just a little too late
Is this what you want, what you need
Is this what you wanted me to be
Always loved me strapped to you
Lock it down and drive me through

Push just a little too late
Just a little too late
Push just a little too late
I wanted more than this
Push just a little too late
I wanted more than this
Push just a little too late
I expected more than this
More than this
More than this
More than this
More than this
More than this
More than this
More than this
