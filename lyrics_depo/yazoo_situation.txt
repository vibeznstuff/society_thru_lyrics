Blue eyed, dressed for every situation
Moving through the doorway of a nation
Pick me up and shake the doubt
Baby, I can't do without

(Move out) don't mess around
(Move out) you bring me down
(Move out) how you get about it
Don't make a sound, just move out

I remember only for an hour
Move right through me, can you feel the power?
I don't know what's going on
It scares me, but it won't be long

(Move out) don't mess around
(Move out) you bring me down
(Move out) how you get about it
Don't make a sound, just move out

(Move out)
(Move out)
(Move out)

(Move out)
(Move out)
(Move out)

Now, he's in control, he is my lover
Nations stand against him, he's your brother
Been a long time, been a long time now
I'll get to you somehow, yeah

(Move out) don't mess around
(Move out) you bring me down
(Move out) how you get about it
Don't make a sound, just move out

(Move out) don't mess around
(Move out) you bring me down
(Move out) how you get about it
Don't make a sound, just move out

(Move out)
(Move out)
(Move out)

(Move out) don't mess around
(Move out) you bring me down
(Move out) how you get about it
Don't make a sound, just move out

Now, he's in control, he is my lover
Nations stand against him, he's your brother
Been a long time, been a long time now
I'll get to you somehow, yeah

(Move out) don't mess around
(Move out) you bring me down
(Move out) how you get about it
Don't make a sound, just move out

(Move out) don't mess around
(Move out) you bring me down
(Move out) how you get about it
Don't make a sound, just move out
