Speak to me pretty ah speak to me nice
Quote me those wonderful phrases once or twice
Speak to me softly speak to me sweet
Make like a fabulous poet each time we meet
Words are like rainbows bright as the stars
Ah they're always with you ah where ever you are
They'll follow speak to me softly as you do my heart will happily follow you
Speak to me pretty speak to me sweet oh oh words can knock me off my feet
Speak to me speak to me speak to me

I say that words are like rainbows...
