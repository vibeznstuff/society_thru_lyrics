Standin' on the outside
Lookin' in
You know it's been a long time
Don't know where to begin
So much I wanna say-ay
So much I wanna do-oo
Friends are tellin' me,
It's time that you broke through

I've been through the hard times,
Of searchin' soul
You know it's been a hard climb,
From rock'n'roll
Now I feel a need in me,
So har-ard to explai-ai-ai-ain
Now I've seen the joy of light
And I wanna remai-ai-ain

Standing on the insi-ide,
I finally broke that line
Ring around the circle-le,
Don't you know that it feels so fi-i-ine
Every waking moment I just wanna sing the new-ews
That I'm standin' on the inside,
Kicked away them blues

All the phoney fa-aces,
Stand in line
All the backsla-appers
Know my name this time
Now that I've turned the lo-ock
Now that I've opened the door-oor
I won't be on the outside,
No, anymore-ore-ore-ore

Standing on the insi-ide,
I finally broke that line
Ring around the circle-le,
Don't you know that it feels so fine
Every waking moment
I just wanna sing the new-ews
That I'm standin' on the inside,
Pushed away them blues

Now that I've turned the lock
Now that I've opened the door-oor-oor-oor
I won't be on the outside,
No, anymore

Standing on the insi-ide,
I finally broke that line
Ring around the circle-le,
Don't you know that it feels so fine
Every waking moment
I just wanna sing the new-ews
That I'm standin' on the inside,
I kicked away them blues

Standin' on the inside (standing on the inside)
Standin' on the i-insi-ide (standing on the inside)
I kicked, I kicked, I kicked, I kicked (standing on the inside)
Sta-andin' on the inside (standin' ...)
