(I wanna love you but I, but I better not)

Poison

(I wanna love you but I, but I better not)

Poison

Your cruel device
your blood, like ice
One look, could kill
My pain, your thrill...

I wanna love you but I better not touch
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much 
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison
Your poison running through my veins
Your poison
I don't wanna play these games

(I wanna love you but I, but I better not)

Poison

Your mouth, so hot
Your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet
Black lace, on sweat

I hear you calling and it's needles and pins
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
Don't wanna touch you but you're under my skin
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison
Your poison running through my veins
Your poison
I don't wanna break these chains
