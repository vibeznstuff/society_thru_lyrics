I may be a rich man's daughter
And have servants of my own 
I can snap my fingers 
And I could have anything I want

Sometimes I look out my window 
See lover's hand in hand walk by 
They see the diamonds I wear
But not the tears of envy in my eye 

Oh when will the good apples fall on my side of the fence 
When will I taste the sweet fruits of life 
When will the sun smile for me  through great cloudy skies above 
When will I find my true true love 

Well my daddy says 
Don't worry  
And my daddy says  
Just wait 
I'm going to find you a rich man's son 
And bring him to our gate

Sometimes I look out my window 
See lovers hand in hand walk by 
Daddy doesn't know it 
There are some things that money just can't buy

Oh when will the good apples fall on my side of the fence 
When will I taste the sweet fruits of life 
When will the sun smile for me through great cloudy skies above 
When will I find my true true love

When will I find my true true love 
When will I find my true true love 
When will I find my true true love 
When will I find my true true love
