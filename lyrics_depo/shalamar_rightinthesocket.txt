Blackouts don't mean a thing to me
You generate all the life I need
Your lips glow with electricity
We got our private source of energy

Right in the socket
Right dead in the socket
Right dead in the socket

Never felt this way before
When other guys knocked on my front door
You even shocked me on the dance floor
Just a real lie wire
Really set the night on fire
You know how to satisfy my desire

Hey, I wouldn't have it any other way
When you're holdin' me (Hey)
If it's like this when we kiss
Feel that electricity

Where love is right dead in the socket
Got to be real love
Right dead in the socket
I know that's what I'm feelin', yeah
Right dead in the socket

I can't help the way I feel
If I seem a bit suggestive
There ain't nothin' wrong if love is real
My emotions are strong
And this is my kind of love song
And you're the only one I'm groovin' on

Hey, I wouldn't have it any other way
When you're holdin' me (Hey)
If it's like this when we kiss
Feel that electricity

Where love is right dead in the socket
Talk about real love, baby
Right dead in the socket, hey...ey...
The kind that drives me crazy, yeah
Right dead in the socket

In the socket
Your love is right dead in the socket

It's got to be love
It's got to be love
It's got to be love
It's got to be love

Right dead in the socket
Right dead in the socket
Right dead in the socket
Right dead in the socket

Right dead in the socket
Right dead in the socket

Your love is right dead in the socket
Right dead in the socket
Right dead in the socket

Never felt this way before
When other guys knocked on my front door
You even shocked me on the dance floor
Just a real live wire
Really set the night on fire
You know how to satisfy my desire

Hey, I wouldn't have it any other way
When you're holdin' me (Hey)
If it's like this when we kiss
Feel that electricity

Your love is right dead in the socket
Hoo...right dead
Right dead (Yeah) in the socket
Ain't nothin' wrong if love is real
Read dead in the socket

I can't help the way I feel
Feel that electricity

Where life is right dead in the socket
Right dead in the socket
