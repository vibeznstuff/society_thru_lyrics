Now Listen
Not a dime, I can't pay my rent
I can barely make it through the week
Saturday night I'd like to make my girl
But right now I can't make ends meet

I'm always working slaving every day
Gotta get away from that same old same old
I need a chance just to get away
If you could hear me think this is what I'd say


Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist
Ain't looking for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this

They say I spend my money on women and wine
But I couldn't tell you where I spent last night
I'm really sorry about the shape I'm in
I just like my fun every now and then

I'm always working slaving every day
Gotta get away from that same old same old
I need a chance just to get away
If you could hear me think this is what I'd say



You see I raise a toast to all of us
Who are breaking our backs every day
If wanting the good life is such a crime
Lord, then put me away
Here's to ya
