Shake me into the night
And I'm an easy lover
Take me into the fight
And I'm an easy brother
And I'm on fire

Burn my sweet effigy
I'm a road runner
Spill my guts on a wheel
I wanna taste uh-huh
And I'm on fire
And I'm on fire

And I'm on fire...
(I'm going, you tell me, I feel it, I say it
I'm heading back into the tunnel for my soul to burn)
And I'm on fire...
(I'm coming, you coming, no hiding, my feeling
I wanna take it to the highest over me, yeah...)
Whoo Whoo
Whoo Whoo

Wire me up to machines
I'll be your prisoner
Find it hard to believe
You are my murderer
I'm on fire behind you
Heads a fallen sky

And I'm on fire...
(I'm going, you tell me, I feel it, I say it
I'm heading back into the tunnel for my soul to burn)
And I'm on fire...
(I'm coming, you coming, no hiding, my feeling
I wanna take it to the highest over me, yeah...)

And I'm on fire...
I'm on fire...

Move on, you got to move on
You got to hit 'em to the hip
And get your shake on

Move on, you got to move on
You got to hit 'em to the hip
And get your shake on

I feel it, I want it, I'm coming, I tell ya,
I caught the bullet from the heavens to the one you serve,
I'm going, I'm running, out to the highest love
I'm wanna hit you to the hip...

(I'm on fire...)
Move on, you got to move on
You got to hit 'em to the hip
And get your shake on

(I'm on fire...)
Move on, you got to move on
You got to hit 'em to the hip
And get your shake on
