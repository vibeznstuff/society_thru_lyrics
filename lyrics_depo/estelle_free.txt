Ok (Ok) U.K get up
Mega. listen
Everyone put ya fists in the air now
(air now, air now, air now)
Everyone put ya fists in the air now(air now, air now)

Everyone put ya fists in the air now,
bounce on ya feet like they every can scream ya (ow)
This is the start oh the start of the new year,
Get out ya boots get ready to start this hit
Get out ya house do somethin' with y'self
Put down the weed prove somethin' to y'self
This is out to the ladies and gents
Tryna do for themselves...

You could say that this life is a laugh,
I would say it's cool but we here it a lot,
So, fix up be true to y'self
Save up for a ring or a belt or,
Year's young and the night's are blazin'
Cause your heavy and old and say your achin'
U wanna easier life?
You should go to Iraq and talk about love...

Cause we only get one life, and then it's gone for good,
And your the only one who seems to be stopping you,
So when you step make sure it's true and take your time,

Free!
Don't think about being less than yourself,
Free!
Begging to people, never good for your health,
Free!
Don't have to kill no-one or have to steal,
From no-one, in life,

Ain't nothin' to make a change or two,
Nuttin' to nuttin' to break chains over you
Yeah your spittin' but I break out you
Now, shame, your lookin' at my rent house people,
Boyz it's somethin' that the boyz go through
Y'all steady, this steppin' is what the boyz go through

Don't think about being less than yourself,

Lemme see what came through fresh class
Steady you're free you go and throw these up, up
New season, beat the new boy up, up
Better stay on the ground till ya times up, up
Make ya mind up, up...

Free!
Don't think about being less than yourself,
Free!
Begging to people, never good for your health,
Free!
Don't have to kill no-one or have to steal,
From no-one, in life,

Free!
Don't think about being less than yourself,
Free!
Begging to people, never good for your health,
Free!
Don't have to kill no-one or have to steal,
From no-one, in life,
(Through this life)

This is a dog eat dog world
But it belongs to the man,
But it's not without the love
Of a woman's understanding
Hurting ourselves for no reason that you have,
Was already yours, anyway,
If you see somebody I want you to smile instead of frown,
Just because they look angry
Don't mean they wanna beat you down,
And it, don't cost you nothing
But you pay for a gun,
Kill our sisters and sons,
People we need to be...

Free!

Said we're Free, to live and love again
To your mum or your sister, brother or friend,
This can be solved, just find it in your soul,
Come get your Free, come get your Free-dom,
For all people!
