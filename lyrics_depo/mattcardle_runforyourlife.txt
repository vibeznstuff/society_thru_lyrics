You need somebody who likes themself
Who lives for life and never calls for help
You need somebody to walk you back
Someone who loves you too before you ask

You’re worth more, you’re worth more than this
You can take a leap without the risk
There’s no time, there’s no time for this
Take your love and start again

So run for your life, run for your life
If you leave me behind, you'll get there in time

You need someone who can stand alone
Who finds the way, instead of being shown
Somebody with confidence
Who's strong enough to be hit more than once

You'll find more, you'll find more than this
Take the world that's at your fingertips
Don't waste time, don't waste time with this
Take your love and start again

So run for your life, run for your life
If you leave me behind, you'll get there in time

Run, run and don't look back again
Run, run, one day you'll understand
I'm not, no, I'm not who you think I am

So run for your life (run and don't look back again, run and don't look back again)
Run for your life (one day you'll understand, one day you'll understand)
If you leave me behind, you'll get there in time

Run for your life, run for your life
If you leave me behind, you'll get there in time
