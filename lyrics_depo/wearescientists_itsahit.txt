I should've known that this would happen from the start
This kind of function's gonna have to fall apart
I guess before I would've sworn that we were friends
Maybe this problem points towards some larger trend

But I still don't understand
What this whole thing's about
And all the words that you said
Are somehow stuck in my mouth
And this was going so well
But I don't know what I did
All I really can tell, is
I've been hit
I've been hit
I've been hit

Well there's only so much drama I can stand
And this is just about as far as I will bend
So get your hands of my lapel
Because I think it's time to go
You oughta know better.
You know,
You oughta know

But I still don't understand
What this whole thing's about
And all the words that you said
Are somehow stuck in my mouth
And this was going so well
But I don't know what I did
All I really can tell, is
I've been hit
I've been hit
I've been hit

As I was falling down the stairs
And out the door
I guess I heard you yell my name
But I'm not sure
You know before I could've sworn that we were friends
But that's how these problems always seem to end

But I still don't understand
What this whole thing's about
When all the words that you said
Are somehow stuck in my mouth
And this was going so well
But I don't know what I did
All I really can tell
Is that I always get hit

And I still don't understand
What this whole thing's about
And all the words that you said
Are somehow stuck in my mouth
I guess I might take it back
But I'm not sure what I did
All I know about that, is
I've been hit
I've been hit
I've been hit
