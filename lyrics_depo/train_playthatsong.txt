Play that song
The one that makes me go all night long
The one that makes me think of you
That's all you gotta do

Hey Mister DJ when you gonna spin it
My baby's favorite record
She been waiting for a minute
She invited all her friends
And I'm buying all the rounds
And they're all dolled up
DJ please don't let me down

When you gonna play that song, now
When you gonna earn that pay
When you gonna play that song
And make my day
She said

Play that song
The one that makes me go all night long
The one that makes me think of you
That's all you gotta do
Hey

Play that song
The one that makes me stay out til dawn
The one that makes me go ooh
That's all you gotta do

Hey Mister Guitar
When you gonna strum it
My girl just heard this song
And you should play it cause she loves it
Can you get me off the hook
Get them fingers picking now
I'll throw some money in your cup
Mister please don't let me down

When you gonna play that song, now
Why you gotta hesitate
When you gonna play that song
And make my day
She said

Play that song
The one that makes me go all night long
The one that makes me think of you
That's all you gotta do
Hey

Play that song
The one that makes me stay out til dawn
The one that makes me go ooh
That's all you gotta do

Oh, wait till you see my baby
Moo-oo-oove, moo-oo-oove
Moo-oo-oove
Oh, wait till you see my baby
Moo-oo-oove, moo-oo-oove
Moo-oo-oove
Oh, come on now

Play that song
The one that makes her go all night long
The one that makes her think of me
That's all you gotta do
Hey

Play that song
The one that makes her stay out til dawn
The one that makes her go ooh
That's all you gotta do
That's all you gotta do
That's all you gotta do
That's all you gotta do
