You keep me waiting, you won't answer your phone
I know you're home but you're not alone
Stop playing games, girl
You're playing with my heart

I was a fool to fall for you lies
It took so long for me to open my eyes
I was a stranger
A stranger from the start

But how long must I stand out in the cold
Can't you see the writing's on the wall
I've been waiting
I can't wait anymore
I can't wait anymore
I can't wait anymore

The more I want you, the less I get
I've been alone since the day that we met
I'm trying hard, girl
I'm trying to forget

I walked the streets, I stood at your door
You gave me nothing and I came back for more
You were a stranger
A stranger to my heart

But how long must I stand out in the cold
Can't you see the writing's on the wall
I've been waiting
I can't wait anymore
I can't wait anymore
I can't wait anymore

I was a fool to fall for your lies
It took so long for me to realize
I was a stranger
A stranger from the start

But how long must I stand out in the cold
Can't you see the writing's on the wall
I've been waiting
I can't wait anymore
I can't wait anymore
I can't wait anymore

I can't wait anymore
