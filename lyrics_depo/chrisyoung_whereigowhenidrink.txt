There's a barstool downtown
With my name on it
There's a party crowd
Promising a good time
But I ain't goin'
Used to be I'd be there
Throwin' a couple down
But now one leads to two
And two leads to four
And before I know it
I'm thinkin' about

Standing at the end of the drive
Your tail lights fading in to the night
Screaming your name
In the pouring down rain
Watching you leave us behind
So I don't go out on the town
All the whiskey I had I poured out
My heart needs time to get over you and me
And that's where I go when I drink

Sometimes I feel like
I could have a few
But I know better
Your memory's no quitter
And every time I do I'm

Standing at the end of the drive
Your tail lights fading in to the night
Screaming your name
In the pouring down rain
Watching you leave us behind
So I don't go out on the town
All the whiskey I had I poured out
My heart needs time to get over you and me
And that's where I go when I drink

One drop
You flood my mind
Like river of goodbye

And I'm standing at the end of the drive
Your tail lights fading in to the night
Screaming your name
In the pouring down rain
Watching you leave us behind
So I don't go out on the town
All the whiskey I had I poured out
My heart needs time to get over you and me
And that's where I go when I drink

When I drink
That's where I go
When I drink
