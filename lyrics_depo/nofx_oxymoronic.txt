I've been called an OxyMoron
Because I question which drugs our war's on
Why are there more drug stores than liquor stores you can score on
The healers have become the harmers
They're just pharmaceutical farmers
What we used to call dealers
We now call doctors
I might be a CD Cynic
Cause that crack house is now a clinic
It's time they change the name of the oath to
The hypocritic or the parasitic

It isn't Adderalltruistic
By overprescribing
How can we fight them in a Suboxone ring
I'll throw a Prozacuzation
With a Subketamining
They'll say my fears are Quaaludacris
They should be Ativanishing

With every Demeroltercation
They'll have a good Xanaxplanation
You're just Cialistrated
Cause we made your dick deflated

It's OxyMoronic
It's OxyMoronic

It should be doctors getting busted
For their Klonopinions we trusted
We're not the sinners, they're the ones
That served us the Vicodinners
I don't want to be an alarmist
But in that harmacy there's a harmacist
And those scripts are making us Paximple minded pacifists

It's OxyMoronic
It's OxyMoronic
It's OxyMoronic
It's OxyMoronic

Don't think that I AmBien crazy
The medical industrial complex
Keeps us Viagravated and hard to come
Because of Percosex
How can we Hydrocondone
Their blatant misconduct
They don't care for patients
They care about pushing product

Are you OxyMoronic
For wanting your daily chronic
And making your mom's house hydroponic
You're OxyMoronic

I've been called an OxyMoron
For getting my metaphor on
Linoleum is a Flooron
I'm an OxyMoron

It's time to be alarmed
We're not being healed, we're being harmed
Our country's being factory farmed
It's OxyMoronic
It's time to sound the alarma
We can't put our faith in karma
We got a common enemy
And they're called Big Pharma

And it's OxyMoronic
And it's OxyMoronic
It's all OxyMoronic
It's all OxyMoronic

- Daily chronic, now most of your house is, okay
- "Most of your house is" what does that even mean?
- He's turned most of his house into hydroponic
- Why wouldn't he have turned all of it into hydroponic?
- Well cause he lives there
- "Now all of your house is hydroponic"
"Most" is sappy. Really, it's like saying "maybe".
- How about "Now your mom's house is hydroponic"?
- Yes! That's fucking way better
God, you fucking woke up
Come on, Mike, where you've been?
- Shut the fuck up, fool
- Where you've been all month?
