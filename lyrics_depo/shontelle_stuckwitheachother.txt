You can, think you can get free
You think you won't need me
That you're gonna get you somethin' better,
But you know that we're in this forever,
And you can, think you can walk out
Even with your doubts,
But you know that we're in this together
You can try to push me from you
Nothing you do will keep us a part


Cause it's too late, there's no escape
Might as well face it, baby we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Ain't nothin you can do about it
It's been too long, it's been too strong
Cause we belong here
Baby, we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Stuck in love with each other
(stuck in love with each other)


Yeah
Now I can say that I would not care
If you were not there,
Tell myself that I'll be fine without ya
but I would die if I was not around ya,
and I can try to convince you
I don't need to be with you,
But my only thoughts are thoughts about ya,
What can I do, love is like glue.
There's no way to
Tear us a part

Cause it's too late (too late, too late)
There's no escape, might as well face it,
Baby we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other (with each other)
ain't nothin i can do about it
It's been too long, it's been too strong
yes, we belong here,
Baby we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other (stuck with each other)
stuck in love with each other
(stuck in love with each other)


There's nothing i'd rather do
Than to sit with you forever
Can't think of nothin better
Than to be stuck with you

Cause it's too late, there's no escape
Might as well face it,
baby we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Ain't nothin we can do about it
Oh yeah

Cause it's too late, there's no escape
Might as well face it,
baby we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Ain't nothin I can do about it
It's been too long, it's been too strong
Yes, we belong here
baby, we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Stuck in love with each other
(stuck in love with each other)

Cause it's too late, there's no escape
Might as well face it,
Baby we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Ain't nothin we can do about it
It's been too long, it's been too strong
Yes we belong here,
baby we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Stuck in love with each other
(stuck in love with each other)

Ain't nothin gonna stop me and you ey
Cause you know we just stuck like glue ey
Akon
Ain't nothin we can do
We stuck in love with each other
