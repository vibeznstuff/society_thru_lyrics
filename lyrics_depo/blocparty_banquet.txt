A heart of stone, a smoking gun
I can give you life, I can take it away

A heart of stone, a smoking gun
I'm working it out
Why'd you feel so underrated?
Why'd you feel so negated?

Turning away from the light
Becoming adult
Turning into myself
I wanted to bite not destroy
To feel her underneath
Turning into the light

She don't think straight
She's got such a dirty mind and it never ever stops
And you don't taste like her and you never ever will
And we don't read the papers, we don't read the news
Heaven's never enough, we will never be fooled

And if you feel a little left behind
We will wait for you on the other side

Cos I'm on fire
Cos you know I'm on fire when you come
Cos you know I'm on fire
Cos you know I'm on fire so stomp me out
Cos I'm on fire
