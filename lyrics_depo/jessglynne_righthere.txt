Finally I’m where I want to be,
I didn’t think this life was gonna be for me
A love you gave me to discover was right here
But now I’m caught up in a dream, don’t wanna leave!

See I ain’t been one for wishing not at all
When you least expect it’s creepin’ up on you
No confiding or abiding to no rules
And now I’m content knowing that I’m here with you

Right here, you got me where you want me
Now I’m right here, waiting for your calling
Now I’m right here, you got me where you want me
Now I’m right here, right here!

Oh oh oh, ah ah ah
Oh oh oh, ah ah ah
Oh oh oh, ah ah ah
Oh oh oh

Infatuation took a whole of my mind, 
I wouldn’t change it for the world, now that you’re mine
You played me hard to get for a while
Still cut me deeper every day with your smile!

See I ain’t been one for wishing not at all
When you least expect it’s creepin’ up on you
No confiding or abiding to no rules
And now I’m content knowing that I’m here with you

Right here, you got me where you want me
Now I’m right here, waiting for your calling
Now I’m right here, you got me where you want me
Now I’m right here, right here!

Oh oh oh, ah ah ah
Oh oh oh, ah ah ah
Oh oh oh, ah ah ah
Oh oh oh

Finally I’m content
Oh yes, I’ve found that thing
Right here is where I’ll stay
But I’m not complacent
Finally I’m content
Oh yes, I’ve found that thing
Right here is where I’d stay
But I’m not complaining

Right here, you got me where you want me
Now I’m right here, right here
Oh oh oh, ah ah ah
Oh oh oh, ah ah ah

Right here, you got me where you want me
Now I’m right here, waiting for your calling
Now I’m right here, you got me where you want me
Now I’m right here, right here!  (Oh!)

Right here, you got me where you want me
Now I’m right here, waiting for your calling
Now I’m right here, you got me where you want me
Now I’m right here, right here!

Oh oh oh, ah ah ah
Oh oh oh, ah ah ah
Oh oh oh, ah ah ah
Oh oh oh, ah ah ah
