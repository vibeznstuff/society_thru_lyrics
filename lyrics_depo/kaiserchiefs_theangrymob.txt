I can prove anything
I'll make you admit again and again
I can prove anything
The way that it's read again and again

And its only cos you came here with your brothers too
If you came here on your own you'd be dead
Its only cos you follow what the others do
Its no excuse to say your easily lead

You can choose anything
You choose to lose again and again
You could do anything
Why should you do anything again

And its only cos you came here with your brothers too
If you came here on your own you'd be dead
Winding yourself up until your turning blue
Repeating everything that you've read

And here we go with the letter
Well can you fix it for me
Cos we need entertainment
To keep us all off the streets

So tonight you'll sleep softly in your bed

You can try anything
And no-one would know apart from you and me
You can stop anything
It's starts with just one and turns to two then three

Its only cos you came here with your brothers too
If you came here on your own you'd be dead
Raise a glass or two
You raise a fist or two
Get a shopping basket wrapped round your head

So here we go with the letter
Oh can you fix it for me
24 hour drinking
To keep us all off the streets

So tonight you'll sleep softly in your bed

We are the angry mob
We read the papers everyday day
We like who like
We hate who we hate
But we're also easily swayed
