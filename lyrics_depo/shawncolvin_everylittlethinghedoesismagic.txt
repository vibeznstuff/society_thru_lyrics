Well, I've tried before to tell him
All the feelings I have for him in my heart
Every time that I come near him
I just loose my nerve as I've done from the start

'Cause every little thing he does is magic
Every thing he does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for him goes on

Do I have to tell the story
Of the thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me who ends up getting wet

'Cause every little thing he does is magic
Every thing he does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for him goes on

I resolve to call him up
A thousand times a day
And ask him if he'll marry me
In some old fashioned way

But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has stripped me
Must I always be alone?

Every little thing he does is magic
Every thing he does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for him goes on

And every little thing he does is magic
Every thing he does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for him goes on
It goes on, it goes on
