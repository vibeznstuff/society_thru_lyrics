Stand up tall...

Rascit, boy in the corner I still roll deep young star gimmee the beat and let me prove
London city forever you’re not a still creep aint no stopping me ever you best move
Live o ghetto record with no redemption world wide critics acclaim my big moves
Showtime main event you can’t beef me Dizzee Rasc hotter than Nelly I can’t lose

East side boy make the paper rise, never met anything like my safeheart guys
Big up my north west south east types every section where my connection lies
East side boy made the crowd go loops never had a desire for chinese zoots
Big up my midland up north troops any playas in my face come up with a bruse

Get your backs up backs up back off the wall

Don’t give it half hearted give it all
Pull your socks up and stand up tall
Backs up backs up back off the wall

Don’t give it half hearted give it all pull your socks up and stand up tall

Can’t run the marathon without trainin or stretch to asshole without straining
Too much hype not enough brain in whole lotta money little maintaining
Whole lotta complaining no plan little more no less then ten grand
Blingin ice sitting nice in your hand too much platinum not enough land

East side boy make the paper rise never met anything like the safeheat guys
Big up my Ireland Scotland types every section where my connection lies
Eastside boy made the crowd go loops never had a desire for Chinese zoots
Big up my Europe USA troops any playas in my face come up with a bruse

Get your backs up backs up back off the wall
Sounds of the young star dizzee rascal
Don’t give it half hearted give it all pull your socks up and stand up tall
Backs up backs up back off the wall
Sounds of the young star dizzee rascal
Don’t give it half hearted give it all pull your socks up and stand up tall
