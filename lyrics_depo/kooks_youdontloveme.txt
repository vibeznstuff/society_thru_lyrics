But you don't love me the way that, I love you
'cause if you did girl you would not, do those things you do
You killed my heart just to see if, I will rise
Above your anger and above your lies

And all I see of you, is when you're not so busy
Oh your not so busy

And you don't love me the way that, I love you
'cause if you did boy you would not, do the things you do
You turned my life around, before that I am glad
However much I love you this love is getting bad

And oh my darling look at you
The words that only you could use
But you no you'll always be my girl, girl
I'll take you out just for a bite
Show you all the city sites
But you know you'll always be my girl, girl

But you don't love me the way that, I love you
'cause if you did boy you would not, do those things you do
You killed my heart just to see if, I will rise
Above your anger and above your lies

And all I see of you, is when you're not so busy
Oh your not so busy

But you don't love me you don't care, woman
And you don't love me you don't care, woman
'Cause you don't love me you don't care, woman
if you don't love me you don't care, woman
Oh woman
