Rude boy don't watch that
Cause if its arms out I'll run that
And if its on top you know I got that
Come through with a big baseball bat

Like Blud don't make me get old school
Blud don't make me get old school
Blud don't make me get old school
Blud don't make me get old school


Stop rolling with that Breda you don't need it

As the Breda always chatting like his strong
Sneaky fake, ? his running to his brother when it's on
Hardly backs the beef, last one swinging
First one running making them stories his a chief
Bring bredas to his ends, acting up
Putting on a show trying to talk funny to his friends
But his really not a ? they know it
And you know it, something must be seriously wrong
Cause your ? his mum calls you darling
But his brothers got you shotting
And we know where you're stopping
I heard you both have beef with an older Brere
You took a spark and he just stood there
Now that boys a pussyhole say it ain't true
It started because of him and ended with you
And its that kind of shit that's gonna continue
But it guess it don't matter it that's what your into


Stop rolling with that Breda you don't need it
He's a pussyhole his a chief leave it
Stop rolling with that Breda you don't need it

You know that his a pussyhole
I showed you his a pussyhole
His always been a pussyhole
So he will always be a pussyhole
You're still with that pussyhole
You must be a pussyhole


The Suns the biggest star in the sky
But naturally its gotta make room for the moon every night
Every friend got his time limit
Even relationship
Everything's sunny when the friendships tight
A friend in need is a friend indeed
But a friend with no money and no weed
Could flip the script to end ridiculously
And make a best friend and ex friend for the ?
A couple years ago in my roll yut days
I was into pirate radio I guess it was a phase
There was this one particular MC man
He was an older in my ends and I thought he was the dan
So I started rolling with him like a little brother
My cousin used to say he was a pussy undercover
I didn't think it was nothing more than jealousy
But I wish I woulda listened everytime he told me


Stop rolling with that Breda you don't need it
He's a pussyhole his a chief leave it
Stop rolling with that Breda you don't need it
He ain't got your back if its beef leave it

Why you rolling with that pussyhole
Moving with that pussy hole
You know that his a pussyhole
I showed you his a pussyhole
His always been a pussyhole
So he will always be a pussyhole
You're still with that pussyhole
You must be a pussyhole



Pussyhole 


Stay away from those pussyholes you can have it all
Live endlessly tremendous forever ball
Stand up for something or forever fell a fool
But definitely know when not to lose your cool
Cause it ain't what you show its what your conceding
Put a smile on the deepest negative feeling
Stand tall even when their hating and their scheming
Yea watch your money rise right to the ceiling
Stand tall even when their hating and their scheming
Yea watch your money rise right to the ceiling
