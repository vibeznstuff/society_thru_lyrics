Lately all you can feel is the rain fallin'.
Maybe you feel this world is to blame, you've been cryin'.

Only, only inside will you know, but still you wonder sometimes.
Where can, where can you go?

Remember me. oh. when you feel this way
And you need someone to lean on.

(As if you're ever) Ever too far away,
(Remember me) I am the one (remember me) I am the one

Remember me, I am the one who sees in your eyes.
Remember me, I am the one who sees in your eyes.

Remember me, I am your guardian angel
And I'll never let you fall.

And if you're ever, ever in fear or danger,
(Remember me) I am the one (Remember Me) I am the one who will turn

Remember me, I am the one...
Turn all your darkness to light in the morning.
You learn when you're too hard on yourself, you can call me.

Remember me, oh, when you feel this way...
Remember me, I am the one...
