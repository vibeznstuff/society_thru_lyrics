Pass me a drink to the left, yeah
Said her name was Delilah
And I'm like, "you should come my way"
I already surrender
Damn girl that body's fire
You gon' remember my name
(She should give it up, definite)

You need it
I need it
We can jump in the deep end
I wanna get lost in your love

I just wanna be close to you
(Just wanna, I just wanna)
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
(I just wanna, I just wanna)
And show you the way I feel
You make my love go...
You make my love go...
You make my love go...

In the morning we gon' do it again, wake up
I'mma do it like we just broke up and made up
Get up on top of me and work up a sweat, work up a sweat
See we can, do it any type of way that you want
I'm thinking maybe you're the right kind of wrong
I'm saying baby you won't ever forget my love

You need it
I need it
We can jump in the deep end
I wanna get lost in your love

I just wanna be close to you
(Just wanna, I just wanna)
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
(I just wanna, I just wanna)
And show you the way I feel
You make my love go...
You make my love go...
You make my love go...
