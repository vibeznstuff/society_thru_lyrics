We cross the street
You hold my hand
Afraid to let go 
And if I walked away
And left you there
Would you know why

You are the answer now
You don't know
You can be everything
You don't know
You won't believe it now
You don't know anymore
You are the reason and the rhyme

We walk into your room
A mirror's caught your reflection
You walk away and call to me
To fill in the frame

You are the only one
You don't know
You are the fire of love
You don't know
You can believe it now
You don't know anymore
You are the reason and the rhyme

I walk this road
You follow me
I don't know why

You are the answer now 
You don't know
You can be everything  
You don't know
You won't believe it now 
You don't know anymore

You are the only one
You don't know
You are the fire of love
You don't know
You can believe it now
You don't know anymore
You are the reason and the rhyme
You are the reason and the rhyme

And if I walked away
And left you there
Would you know why?
