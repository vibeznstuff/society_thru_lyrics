It’s If you could feel how I must feel
The winds of quiet change
If you could see what I must see
Still hidden in the rain
But when the thunder rolls
It comes and covers up my soul

And you will take my hand
And be with me in wonderland
I am an honest man
I need the love of you
I am a working man
I feel the winter too

If you could hear what I must hear
Then nothing would replace
The fifty years of sweat and tears
That never left a trace
But when I look at you
I see you feel the same way too

And you will take my hand
And be with me in wonderland
I am an honest man
I need the love of you
I am a working man
I feel the winter too

You still remember other days
When every head was high
I watched that pride be torn apart
Beneath a darker sky
With innocence within ourselves
We sing the same old song

And you will take my hand
And make believe it’s wonderland
I need the love of you
I am a working man
I feel the winter too
I am an honest man
I need the love of you
I am a working man
I feel the winter too

Wonderland, wonderland, wonderland…
