{Come here baby}
{I got something for you}
{Don't you wanna come with me}
{Hmm, let's go}

Ah, do you, do you, do you, do you feel the power?
Do you, do you feel, do you, do you feel?
Ah, do you, do you, do you, do you feel the power? 

I'll tell you straight up
When it comes to real love
My arms are open and my heart knows the score
I've lived and learned now
Sometimes got burned out
But every time I pick myself off the floor
You need good loving like a desert needs the rain
Never make your heart complain
You keep on running like a river to the sea
Look no further boy 'coz I've got just what you need 

You need the power of a woman
Of a woman
Taking over you, that's what love can do
The power of a woman
Let me take control
Body mind and soul 

Ah, do you, do you, do you, do you feel the power?
Do you, do you feel the power? 

Please don't misunderstand
I need a strong man
Who'll be my soldier, never give up the fight
I've gotta know now
Baby, let me show you how
Can you keep my fire burning morning to night?
You're always caught up in a one way love affair
Never with your heart on the ground
I've got the real thing
Come and get it if you dare
Let me tell you baby, don't you know I'm the one 

You need the power of a woman
Of a woman
Taking over you, that's what love can do
The power of a woman
Of a woman
Let me take control
Body mind and soul 

Ah, do you, do you, do you, do you feel the power?
Do you, do you feel, do you feel the power?
Ah, do you, do you, do you, do you feel the power? 

{Do you feel the power?}

Give me the power 

{Can you hear me baby?}
{I got something for your mind, your body and your soul}

You need good loving like a desert needs the rain
Never make your heart complain
You keep on running like a river to the sea
Look no further boy 'coz I've got just what you need 

You need the power of a woman
Taking over you, that's what love can do
The power of a woman
Let me take control
Body mind and soul 

Ah, do you, do you, do you, do you feel the power?
Do you feel it baby, do you feel the power?
Ah, do you, do you, do you, do you feel the power?
Do you feel it? 

Power of a woman
Taking over you, that's what love can do
Power of a woman
