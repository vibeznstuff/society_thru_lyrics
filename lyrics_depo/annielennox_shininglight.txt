Roman candles that burn in the night
Yeah, you are a shining light
You lit a torch in the empty night
Yeah, you are a shining light
Yeah, you light up my life

You've always been a thorn in their side
But to me you're a shining light
You arrive and the night is alive
Yeah, you are a shining light
Yeah, you light up my life

We made a connection, a full chemical reaction
Brought by dark divine intervention
Yeah, you are a shining light
A constellation once seen over Royal David's city
An epiphany, you burn so pretty
Yeah, you are a shining light

You are a force, you are a constant source
Yeah, you are a shining light
Incandescent into the darkest night
Yeah, you are shining light

And all blood I would sacrifice
For you are my shining light
Sovereign bride of the infinite
Yeah, you are a shining light
Yeah, you light up my life

We made a connection, a full on chemical reaction
Brought by dark divine intervention
Yeah, you are a shining light
A constellation once seen over Royal David's city
An epiphany, you burn so pretty
Yeah, you are a shining light

These are the days you often say
There's nothing that we cannot do
Beneath a canopy of stars
I'd shed blood for you

The North Star in the firmament
You shine the most bright
I've seen you dressed in an electric veil
Shrouded in celestial light

We made a connection, a full on chemical reaction
Brought by dark divine intervention
Yeah, you are a shining light
A constellation once seen over Royal David's city
An epiphany, you burn so pretty
Yeah, you are a shining light
You are a shining light
You are a shining light, ooh yeah
