We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

Should an old friend I know
Stop in say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eye?

Here you go again
Asking where I've been
You can see the tears I cry

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And be can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

Oh let our love survive
I dry the tears your cryin'
Don't let this good thing die

You know I've never lied to you
No no nooo

We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

Caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

Caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?
