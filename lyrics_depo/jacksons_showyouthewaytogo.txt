Let me show you
Let me show you the way to go

I don't know everything
But there's something I do know
(I know, I know)
I've read and heard a lot
And now I'm ready to show
That we can come together
And think like one

Come together now
Live together underneath the sun
Please, please let me show you
Let me show you
Let me show you the way to go

Follow me, my friend
Let me show you, come on
Let me show you the way to go

Just put your trust in me
I'll try not to let you down
(Let you down, let you down)
The job is hard to do
But only we can work this out
'Cause we can help each other to overcome
We can do it
We can do it now
Rejoice everybody
And get the job done

Please, please, please
Just let me show you
Let me show you
Let me show you the way to go
Follow me my friend, hey, hey
Let me show you
Let me show you the way to go
Please follow me, now

That we can help each other to overcome
We can do it
We can do it, now
Live together underneath the sun
Please, please, please
Just let me show you
Let me show you
Let me show you the way to go
I swear I'll never let you down
(Let me show you)
Come on
(Let me show you the way to go)
We can do it, we can do it
We can do it, now
(Let me show you)
(Let me show you the way to go)
Let me, let me, let me
Just let me, let me show you, now
(Let me show you)
Come on
(Let me show you the way to go)
(Follow me, follow me)

(Let me show you)
(Let me show you the way to go)

I swear
I'll never let you down
Come on
Come on
Let me, let me, let me show you
Let me, let me, let me, let me show you
Let me show you
Never let you down
Never let you down
Put your hand in mine
We can do it, we can do it
We can work it out
And get on top
Let me show you
Let me show you
Let me show you
Let me, let me, let me
Let me, let me, let me show you
