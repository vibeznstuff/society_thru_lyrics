No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears.
I'm here, nothing can harm you
My words will warm and calm you.
Let me be your freedom,
Let daylight dry your tears.
I'm here, with you, beside you,
To guard you and to guide you . . .
Then say you love me every winter morning,
Turn my head with talk of summertime . . .
Say you need me with you, now and always . . .
Promise me that all you say is true
That's all I ask of you . . .
Let me be your shelter,
Let me be your light.
You're safe: no-one will find you
Your fears are far behind you . . .
All I need is freedom,
A world that's warm and bright
And you always beside me
To hold me and to hide me . . .
Then say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime . . .
Let me lead you from your solitude . . .
Say you need me with you here, beside you . . .
Anywhere you go,let me go too
That's all I ask of you . . .
Say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me, each night, each morning . . .
Say you feel the way I do
That's all I ask of you . . .
Anywhere you go let me go too . . .
Love me -that's all I ask of you . . .
