Hold
Hold on
Hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady
A little unsteady
Hold
Hold on
Hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady
A little unsteady

Momma
Come here
Approach
Appear
Daddy
I'm alone
'Cause this house don't feel like home

If you love me
Don't let go
If you love me
Don't let go

Hold
Hold on
Hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady
A little unsteady
Hold
Hold on
Hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady
A little unsteady

Mother
I know
That you're tired of being alone
Dad I know you're trying
To fight when you feel like flying

But if you love me
Don't let go
If you love me
Don't let go

Hold
Hold on
Hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady
A little unsteady
Hold
Hold on
Hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady
A little unsteady
Hold
Hold on
Hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady
A little unsteady
