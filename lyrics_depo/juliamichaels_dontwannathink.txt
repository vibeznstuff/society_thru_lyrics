Now I'm not really one for drinking songs
But I guess that I should probably write one
'Cause I'm feeling pretty lonely
Is he the only thing that holds me right now?
Now I'm not really one for drinking songs
But I guess if I'm not wrapped here in your arms
Then I can't talk about love
And who wants to talk about love?
I don't wanna risk

Well, I don't wanna think about you right now
Don't wanna think about you right now
'Cause if I did, it would be damn bad
And I'd show up at your house
I was screaming at your door
Saying "what the fuck is wrong with you?"
I thought that we were good enough
I thought that you needed love
No, I don't wanna think about you right now
Don't wanna think about you right now

Now I'm not really one for drinking songs
But, fuck it here it comes out
Heartbreak is annoying
And I feel it in the morning
Swallow it down like a bitter pill
At least it will taste better than this feeling will
And I don't like myself
And I'm just standing still

Well, I don't wanna think about you right now
Don't wanna think about you right now
'Cause if I did, it would be damn bad
And I'd show up at your house
I was screaming at your door
Saying "what the fuck is wrong with you?"
I thought that we were good enough
I thought that you needed love

I know that when I wake there's gonna be seven texts and three calls to you
And I'm not gonna know what to do
I'll make up some excuse about how that was meant for someone else
When the truth is I'm not over you
