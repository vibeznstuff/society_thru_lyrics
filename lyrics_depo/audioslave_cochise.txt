Well, I've been watching, while you've been coughing.
I've been drinking life, while you've been nauseous.
And so I drink to health, while you kill yourself.
And I've got just one thing that I can offer,

Go on and save yourself, and take it out on me.
Go on and save yourself, and take it out on me. Yeah.

I'm not a martyr, I'm not a prophet,
And I won't preach to you, but here's a caution;
You better understand, that I won't hold your hand,
But if it helps you mend, then I won't stop it.

Go on and save yourself, and take it out on me.
Go on and save yourself, and take it out on me.
Go on and save yourself, and take it out on me.
Go on and save yourself, and take it out on me. Yeah.

Drown if you want, and I'll see you at the bottom,
Where you'll crawl on my skin and put the blame on me, so you don't feel a thing.

Go on and save yourself, and take it out on me.
Go on and save yourself, and take it out on me.
Go on and save yourself, and take it out on me.
Go on and save yourself, and take it out on me. Yeah.
