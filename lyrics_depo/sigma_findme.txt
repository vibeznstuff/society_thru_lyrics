We said goodbye, that's what you told me once
So many times we've made our peace
But this is love, I'll never give you up
I know you'll always come home to me

Like a river, always running
I keep losing you
Like a fire, always burning
I'll be here for you

If you're ready, heart is open
I'll be waiting, come find me
If you're searching for forever
I'll be waiting, come find me

I see you, you're in the darkness
Blinding light right where your heart is
If you're ready, heart is open
I'll be waiting, come find me

Come find me
Come find me

I see you, you're in the darkness
Blinding light right where your heart is
If you're ready, heart is open
I'll be waiting, come find me

We lost our way , that's what you told me last
The tears they come and go
This is us, I'll never get enough
It's taking losing you to know

If you're ready, heart is open
I'll be waiting, come find me
If you're searching for forever
I'll be waiting, come find me

I see you, you're in the darkness
Blinding light right where your heart is
If you're ready (if you're ready)
Heart is open (heart is open)
I'll be waiting, come find me

Come find me
Come find me

Run
Run to me and never leave  now
Run
Run to me and never leave now

I see you, you're in the darkness
Blinding light right where your heart is
If you're ready, heart is open
I'll be waiting, come find me

Come find me

If you're ready (if you're ready)
Heart is open (heart is open)
I'll be waiting, come find me

If you're ready, heart is open
I'll be waiting, come find me
