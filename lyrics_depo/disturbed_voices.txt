So, are you breathing
No, no
Are you breathing
So, are you breathing
No


Wake up, are you alive
Will you listen to me
I'm gonna talk about some freaky shit now
Someone is gonna die
When you listen to me
Let the living die, Let the living die
(say)


Are you breathing, no?
Do the wicked see you?
You still breathing?
You're making me known
Are you breathing, no?
Do the wicked see you?
You still breathing?


What's up? I wonder why?
Do you listen to me?
I'm gonna make you do some freaky shit now
Insane, you're gonna die
When you listen to me
Let the living die, let the living die
(say)



Can't you imagine how good going through this will make you feel?
I promise, no one will ever know
There will be no chance of you getting caught
They never loved you anyway
So come on, be a man
And do what you are compelled to do Save Me God, God 

I can hear the voice But I don't want to listen
Strap me down and tell me I'll be alright
I can feel the subliminal need To be one with the voice
And make everything alright
I can hear the voice But I don't want to listen
Strap me down and tell me I'll be alright
I can feel the subliminal need To be one with the voice
And make everything alright



So, are you breathing? So, do you breathe no, no?
So, are you breathing? So, do you breathe no?
