Baby, although I chose this lonely life
It seems it's strangling me now
All the wild men, big cigars, gigantic cars
They're all laughing at me now
Oh I've been used
I've been taken for a fool, oh what a fool
I broke all the rules
But I won't let the show go on
Baby look there's an enormous crowd of people
And they're all after my blood
I wish maybe they'd tear down the walls
Of this theatre and let me out, let me out
Oh I've been so blind
I've wasted time
Wasted, wasted, oh so much time
Walking on the wire, high wire
But I won't let the show go on


Oh I've been so blind
I've wasted time
Wasted, wasted, oh so much time
Walking on the wire, high wire
But I won't let the show go on
Baby I wish you'd help me escape
And help me get away
Leave me outside my address
Far away from this masquerade
I've been so used I've been so abused
I've been a fool I broke all the rules
I've been so used oh and abused
But I won't let the show go
I said I won't let the show oh
Won't let the show go on
