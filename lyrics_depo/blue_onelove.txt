It's kinda funny how life can change
Can flip 180 in a matter of days
Sometimes love works in mysterious ways
One day you wake up gone without a trace


I refused to give up
I refused to give in
You're my everything
I don't wanna give up
I don't wanna give in, oh no
Everybody sings


One love - for the mother's pride
One love - for the times we cried
One love - gotta stay alive
I will survive
One love - for the city streets
One love - for the hip-hop beats
One love, Oh I do believe
One love is all we need

Late at night I'm still wide awake
Feel this is far more than I can take
I thought my heart could never break
Now I know that's one big mistake





Baby, just love me love me love me
Baby, just hold me hold me hold me
Oh, love me love me love me, Oooh
