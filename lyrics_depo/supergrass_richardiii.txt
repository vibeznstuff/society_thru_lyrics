Got up today, what a day, thanks a million,
I spent too much time wondering why I got an opinion, yeah
I know you wanna try and get away,
But it's the hardest thing you'll ever know,

Waiting in line,
terrible time,
Over familiar
Well take them away
They've nothing to say
They're over the hill, yeah

I know you wanna try and get away,
But it's the hardest thing you'll ever know,
Trying to get at you 
Trying to get at you 

I know you wanna try and get away,
But it's the hardest thing you'll ever know,
I know you wanna try and get away,
But it's the hardest thing you'll ever know.
