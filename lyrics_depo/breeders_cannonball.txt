(Check check check
One, two
One, two)

Spitting in a wishing well
Blown to hell
Crash
On the last splash

I know you, little libertine
I know you're a real koo koo

(Hey now)

Want you
Koo koo
Cannonball
Want you
Koo koo
Cannonball
(Hey now)
In the shade
In the shade
(Hey now)
In the shade
In the shade

I know you, little libertine
I know you're a cannonball
I'll be your whatever you want
The bong in this reggae song

(Hey now)
In the shade
(Hey now)
In the shade

Want you
Koo koo
Cannonball
Want you
Koo koo
Cannonball

Spitting in a wishing well
Blown to hell
Crash
I'm the last splash

I'll be your whatever you want
The bong in this reggae song
(Hey
Hey now)

Want you
Koo koo
Cannonball
Want you
Koo koo
Cannonball
(Hey now)
In the shade
In the shade
(Hey now)
In the shade
In the shade.
