All the rain keeps falling
And these hoes keep calling
Uh

All these rain drops falling on my window
Got me wishing that we did the things we didn't do
And right now I wanna sex you baby
Has anybody sexed you lately
Got all these hoes calling asking me to come through
Asking me to come through
What they don't know
Is it all just make me wanna call you
And ask you if i can sex you lady
Can we do it until we both look crazy


Baby you know I'm from Atlanta
And they raised me like a pimp
Raised me like a pimp, raised me like a pimp
And there's a lot of girls out here
And I could have all of them
But I don't want none of them
I only want one of them


All I wanna do is sex you baby
I wanna know have you had any good sex lately

All these rain drops falling on my window
All the rain keeps falling and these hoes keep calling
All these rain drops falling on my window
Got me looking for my phone
I wanna know can I sex you baby
And have you had any good sex lately lately lately





Have you had any good sex lately
Sex, have you had it
Sex, good sex
Sex, have you had it
All these rain drops falling out my window
