As the bomb goes Neutron
So for you and I
Will the finger on the button decide
If we live or if we die?
The more you think, think
The more you blow, your mind
The more you search for a peace here
The less that you will find

Dance mindless boogie till we drop, don't stop
Music is the drug
Music is the drug were searching for
Mindless boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, don't stop
Mindless boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie till we drop
Dance, dance

Nine hundred or more commit mass suicide in Jonestown
Very strange, very strange
More than ever
The world needs Gods helping hand
Confused, we don't seem to know
What were doin
Like a blind man
Spinnin round in space

Dance mindless boogie till we drop, don't stop
Music is the drug
Music is the drug were searching for
Mindless boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, don't stop
Mindless boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie till we drop
Dance, dance

Like clones and robots that we are
Music is the drug were searchin for
Mindless boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
