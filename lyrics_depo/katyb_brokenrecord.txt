I would toss and turn at night with your voice in my head
Like a broken record all the words you say
And when I finally fall asleep
You find your way into my dreams
But I would never mind, you see
Cause I get to live my fantasy,


And I know though we make our mistakes
But you're holding every breath I take
Feeling this is more than fate
So please don't let me go my baby

And I know though we make our mistakes
But you're holding every breath I take
Feeling this is more than fate
So please don't let me go my baby

I try my best to get away from you so badly
Knowing that I'd give my heart to you so gladly
But then it came reality,
Every word of when she came to me
But now I gave myself to you
I'm so scared of what you're gonna do


And I know though we make our mistakes
But you're holding every breath I take
Feeling this is more than fate
So please don't let me go my baby

And I know though we make our mistakes
But you're holding every breath I take
Feeling this is more than fate
So please don't let me go my baby


Keep your arms exactly where they are
I wanna be here
I wanna feel you
And I keep my thoughts exactly where you are
I wanna be here
I wanna feel you

Like a broken record
Like a broken record
Like a broken record
Like a broken record
Like a broken record
