You remind me, of cigarettes,
The way I hold you, in my chest,
The way you kiss me, with your filter breath,
I keep thinking, I'm getting over this.


Once you had me, you don't have me anymore,
I don't crave you in the morning, or at the company store,
I don't use you to escape, in my fingers out the door,
Once you had me, you don't have me anymore.

But honey, you're smooth
Honey, you're smooth
Honey, you're smooth
Honey, you're smooth


You don't make me, cool,
And I can carry, I'm fine without you
You're a spirit, and you can't be beat,
But when I'm jonesin', honey, I'd buy cheap.




But the truth is that you do
Not the way you used to
But there's something after you

'Cause honey, you're smooth
Honey, you're smooth
Oh, honey, you're smooth
Honey, you're smooth
