Wherever you go,
Whatever you do,
It’s pure and simple,
I’ll be there for you.

You've been saying that I’m driving you crazy,
And I haven't been around for you lately,
but I had a few things on my mind.
When I'm with you I am filled with emotion,
Can't you see that I'm giving you devotion,
And a lover like this is hard to find.
I know I've been walking around in a daze,
Baby, Baby.

Whatever you do,

I've been there through the stormiest weather,
Always trying to make things a bit better,
And I know I’ve gotta try and get through to you.

You can love me in a way like no other,
But the situations taking you under,
So you need to tell me now what you wanna do...
