I'm feeling tired
She kept me up all night and I'm wired
God bless cupid
I'm walking on water
A hundred times a day that I call her
I'm so stupid

So many things I wanna do
I tell her but she needs her room
That makes me wanna get in her space

This kinda love is amazing
Oh she makes me crazy
I love how she never can stay
But it's enough that she wants me
Like her cup of coffee
One kiss baby she's on her way
That kinda love just makes your day

She's got an old boyfriend
Who calls her up at 2 in the morning
I'm so jealous
She says that it's nothing
That's how I know it's probably something
I'm so helpless

A guy like me so insecure
I never ever was before
Somebody finally put me in place

This kinda love is amazing
Oh she makes me crazy
I love how she never can stay
But it's enough that she wants me
Like her cup of coffee
One kiss baby she's on her way
That kinda love just makes your day

A guy like me so insecure
I never ever was before
Somebody finally put me in place

This kinda love is amazing
Oh she makes me crazy
I love how she never can stay
But it's enough that she wants me
Like her cup of coffee
One kiss baby she's on her way
That kinda love just makes your day

This kinda love
This kinda love
That makes your day
