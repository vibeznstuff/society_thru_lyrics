Brainwashed, radicalized
Born to kill, born to die
Strategize and weaponize
Enemy airwaves full of lies

So here we go again, mission: detonation
Compliments of the new world order
This is the new disorder
The new disorder

Digital blackout
Digital blackout
Yeah
Digital blackout

Targeted, terrorized
Sanctified and sanitized
Whitewashed, politicized
For war we leave, for peace we die

So here we go again, mission: detonation
Compliments of the new world order
This is the new disorder

Digital slavery, digital soldier
Digital enemy, over and over
Digital tragedy, digital closure
Over and over, over and over

Digital blackout
Digital blackout
Yeah
Digital blackout

Digital slavery, digital soldier
Digital enemy, over and over
Digital tragedy, digital closure
Over and over, over and over
Digital weaponry, digital cold war
Digital casualty, over and over
Digital strategy, digital torture
Over and over, over and over

Digital blackout

Compliments of the new world order
This is the new disorder
Compliments of the new world order
This is the new disorder
