Something's wrong
Things aren't right
And it turns into a silly fight
You walk out
I get mad
And we both just end up feeling bad
Through the heat
Of the fire
And the trouble that we're going through
There's no harm
There's no danger
Because our love is really tried and true
And I want you here beside me
I need you
'Cause nobody's going to love me
The way that you do
Baby won't you come and hold me
Hold me in your arms
Didn't tell you that I need you
I need you
By my side
And although we're going to
Fight sometimes
I need you
By my side
Please don't walk away and we'll be fine
Through the heat
Of the fire
And the trouble that we're going through
There's no harm
There's no danger
Because our love is really tried and true
You know I need you
You know I won't you
I got to have you
By my side
