On His Way To Dinner
When It Took Him By Surprise
And With One Pull Of The Trigger
He Would Vanish Overnight
Dancing By The Roadside
Holding On For Dear Life
Then A Gun From Out Of Nowhere
Made A Widow Of His Wife

I Don't Mind
Single File Down The Runway
Feelin' Fine
And I'll See You My Friend
Over And Over Again

Who Can We Get On The Case?
We Need Perry Mason
Someone To Put You In Place
Calling Perry Mason Again, Again

Riding Painted Horses
Oh The Kids They Love It So
You Can See It On Their Faces
How They Love The Wind To Blow
Minding My Own Business
Like My Mama Always Said
But If I Don't Try To Help 'Em
They Could Wind Up On The Front Page

I Don't Mind
Draw The Line, Then Draw Me An Arrow
Feelin' Fine
And I'll See You My Friend
Over And Over Again

Who Can We Get On The Case?
We Need Perry Mason
Someone To Put You In Place
Calling Perry Mason Again, Again

Wake Me When It's Over
Tell Me It's All Right
Just Keep On Talking Baby
I've Been Doing This All Night
How Much Did You Give Me
Tell Me It'll Be All Right

Who Can We Get On The Case?
We Need Perry Mason
Someone To Put You In Place
Calling Perry Mason Again
Again Again Again Again
