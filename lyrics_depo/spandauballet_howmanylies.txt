Once there were times
Once there were reasons filled with rhymes
Everything shared, everything told
You keep me so warm
Protect me from all those mighty storms

And dreams seem so old
So look at us now just look at us now
With our hands on our hearts
And lines on our brow

How many lies must we tell?
How many lies must we see?
How many times must we say it's for the best?
And leave truth as the casualty?

Do you read through the lines
Or believe the TV and the Times?
Where can we find more ways to see?
You strain on the truth

And make believe all when you cry wolf
And the lies you're giving me
So look at us now just look at us now
With our hands on our hearts
And lines on our brow

How many lies must we tell?
How many lies must we see?
How many times must we say it's for the best?
And leave truth as the casualty?

Oh well the truth is hard
So when they write the book
Fiction's what you wanna be
Well it's your freedom of choice
But you know that lies are the cancer of democracy

You've painted your face
And now you've tainted your words
And now you're ready and armed with love
Well if you're head is steady
And your soul is ready

We're going up above
So whatever you wanna be
Just come on along with me
If there's truth in our hearts
Maybe we can break free

How many lies must we tell?
How many lies must we see?
How many times must we say it's for the best?
And leave truth as the casualty?

How many lies must we tell?
How many lies must we see?
How many times must we say it's for the best?
And leave truth as the casualty?
How many times must we say it's for the best?
And leave nothing yeah
