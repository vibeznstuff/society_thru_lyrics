

It's been a long time since we started
And all of the hurting we've been through I find that I still in love with you
Searchin' and searchin', looking for better
Greener pastures never grew cause everything I needed I already had with you



Been around and tried to find someone to replace the love that made us one
No one else could ever make me whole, you for me and only me for you
Come to me and we can start things new, heaven knows the way that I miss you
Baby please don't take your love from me,
Only you can make my life complete



I've learned a lesson, never to let the one you love slip away
Oh baby, it took this tragedy
For me to see that you are the only one, baby you complete me



I never knew a love, until you came and showed me what it was
And I'll never let you go, never again
I promise you this time, forever
We'll make it last and things will be better
Better thatn before
