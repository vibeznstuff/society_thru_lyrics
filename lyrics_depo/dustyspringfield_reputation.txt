They're gonna want you
They're gonna love you
They're gonna make your dreams come true
They don't know the real you, but
They're gonna steal you, oh
They're gonna take my dreams away
Well you tried, you looked for a way
Of keeping your face, of keeping your face, oh, oh

You try and you try again
(Isn't worth the patience)
You leave me to cry again
(Who cares what they're thinking?) oh, oh
(Who cares what they're whispering?, whispering, whispering)

You know I won't blame you
And I won't defame you, oh
I won't name you in any court of law
Well you tried, you looked for a way
Of keeping your face, of keeping your face, oh, oh

You try and you try again
(Isn't worth the patience)
You leave me to cry again
(Who cares what they're thinking?) Baby
(Who cares what they're whispering?, whispering, whispering), ooh, ooh

You leave me to cry again

Well you tried
Baby, you looked for a way, oh
You don't want to change, but
You still change the same, oh
