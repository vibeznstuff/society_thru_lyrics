Summertime, if I was getting paid
For getting drunk and getting laid.
I'd grab a phone just to call you up and say
"Quit your job, cause I got it made"

Anytime,
baby lets go,
Everyday
should be a holiday.

Super cool, the Dandy's rule, okay.
Got the dough and got the raves,
Anytime, call me up if you
Got the sun, cause I got the waves.

Anytime,
baby lets go,
Everyday
should be a holiday.

Anytime,
baby lets go,
Everyday
should be a holiday.

Anytime,
baby lets go,
Everyday
should be a holiday.

Anytime,
baby lets go,
Everyday
should be a holiday.
