Gotta drive real cool when them pies be on you (pies be on you)
Just because we stack paper and we ball outrageous (ball outrageous)
Them alphabet boys gotta us under survalence (Ayy)

The same nigga that's a star when you put 'em on stages
I aint cheat--played the hand I was dealt
Tried to tax the grand pearl when I got it myself
(Let's Get It) No nuts, no glory (no glory)
My biography, you damn right, the true story (Yeah)
Set the city on fire, and I didn't even try (try)
Run these streets all day, I can sleep when I die (Ayy)


'Cuz if you lookin' for me you you can find me
On the block disobeyin' the law
Real G--thoroughbred from the streets
Pants saggin' with my gun in my draws
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now
