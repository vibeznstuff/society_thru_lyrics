I'm sick, I like it
There's a moment when we fight
I get so excited
The next move is someone's
Maybe that's what makes it fun
We don't know what's comin'

But you got me and I got you
Couldn't stop this if we wanted to
You got me and I got you

I like us when we're unpredictable
Cause that's when love is so phenomenal
It's better when there's no one in control
We don't know which way it's gonna go

It drives me crazy
We go to bed at night in love
You wake up and hate me
But I just can't fight it
Other people might break up, but that's how I like it

Cause you got me and I got you
It's enough for us to make it through
You got me and I got you

I like us when we're unpredictable
Cause that's when love is so phenomenal
It's better when there's no one in control
We don't know which way it's gonna go
We're better when we're unpredictable
And that's when love is so phenomenal
It's harder when there's no one in control
We don't know which way it's gonna go

I like us when we're unpredictable
Cause that's when love is so phenomenal
It's better when there's no one in control
We don't know which way it's gonna go
No
It's how I like it
It's how I like it

I like us when we're unpredictable
Cause that's when love is so phenomenal
It's better when there's no one in control
We don't know which way it's gonna go
We're better when we're unpredictable
And that's when love is so phenomenal
It's harder when there's no one in control
We don't know which way it's gonna go
