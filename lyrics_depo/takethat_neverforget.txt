Been on this path of life for so long 
Feel I've walked a thousand miles 
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love 
Everybody's been there 
With danger on my mind I would stay on the line of hope 
I knew I could make it 
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw 
My face in the moonlight 
Just then I realised what a fool I could be 
Just cause I look so high I don't have to see me 
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still 
There's a road going down the other side of this hill 

Never forget where you've come here from 
Never pretend that it's all real 
Someday soon this will be someone else's dream 

Been safe from the arms of disappointment for so long 
Feel each day we've come too far 
Yet each day seems to make much more 
Sure is good to be here 
I understand the meaning of "I can't explain this feeling" 
Now it feels so unreal 
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand I make 
The fact of reality 

Never forget where you've come here from 
Never pretend that it's all real 
Someday soon this will be someone else's dream 

We've come so far and we've reached so high 
And we've looked each day and night in the eye 
And we're still so young and we hope for more 
But remember this 
We're not invincible, we're not invincible - No 
We're only people, we're only people 
Hey we're not invincible, we're not invincible 
So again I'll tell you 

Never forget where you've come here from 
Never pretend that it's all real 
Someday soon this will be someone else's dream
