Please don't get me wrong 
See I forgive you in a song 
We'll call the likely lads
But if its left to you,
I know exactly what you'd do 
With all the dreams we had
Just blood run's thicker, oh 
We're thick as thieves, you know
If that's important to you
Its important to me
I tried to make you see
But you don't wanna know
You dont wanna know!

If you pipe all summer long
Then get forgiven in a song
Well that's the touch, my lad 
They sold the rights to all the wrongs
And when they knew you'd give me songs
Welcome back, I said

The blood runs thicker,oh
We're thick as thieves, you know
If thats important to you
It's important to me
I tried to make you see
But you don't want to know
You don't want to know

Oh what became of the Likely Lads?
What became of the dreams we had?

Oh what became of forever?

Oh what became of forever?
Though, we'll never know

Please don't get me wrng
See I forgive you in a song
We call the Likely Lads
We all bought the ones
We taught 'em all we wrote the songs
That's filled with dreams we have
But blood runs thicker, oh
We're thick as thieves, you know
If that's important to you 
It's important to me
I tried to make you see 
But you don't want to know
You don't want to know!

Oh what became of the Likely Lads?
What became of the dreams we had?

Oh what became of forever?
Oh what became of forever?
We'll never know
