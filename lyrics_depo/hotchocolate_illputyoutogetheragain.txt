When you can't take anymore
When you feel your life is over
Put down your tablets and pick up your pen
And I'll put you together again.

If your faith withers away
If God can't bring you your answer
Write me a letter, I'll read it and then
I'll put you together again.

Put us together, together again
Put us together again
When things look hopeless, just write me and then
I'll put you together again.

If there's no light anywhere
And you've got no one to turn to
I'll lead you out of the darkness and then
I'll put you together again.

Put us together, together again
Put us together again
Drop me a few lines, telling me when
And I'll put you together again.

When things look hopeless, just write me, my friend 
And I'll put you together again.
