Don't make me go
Don't make Me go home

Don't make me go
Don't make me go home

'Cause I'm not here to reflect you
I wish your friends would leave me alone
And I could never connect to
The people I don't know from back home

This is an emergency
This is an emergency
This is an emergency
This is an emergency

Please don't do it,
Let's not do this now
Somethings happening,
Can't we stay somehow?

'Cause I'm not here to reflect you
I wish your friends would leave me alone
And I could never connect to
The people I don't know from back home

This is an emergency
This is an emergency
This is an emergency
This is an emergency

'Cause I'm not here to reflect you
I wish your friends would leave me alone
And I could never connect to
The people I don't know from back home

This is an emergency
This is an emergency
This is an emergency
This is an emergency
