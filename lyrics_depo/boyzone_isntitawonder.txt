It's the sign of the times, girl
Sad songs on the radio
It's the sign of the times, girl
As the leaves begin to go
But all these signs now,
showing on my face
Proving me wrong, taking it's place
And I pray to God
That there's more that we can do, yeah
And I pray to God
That there's more that we can show
More that we can do, yeah

Isn't It a Wonder
as a newborn baby cries
And isn't it a wonder
with the sweetness in my eyes
and isn't it a wonder
at the crossroads of my life
Isn't it a wonder?
Isn't it a wonder, to me?

It's the way of the world when,
Wrong takes hold of right
It's the way of the world
In which we've all lost sight
But isn't this world
Too simple to be true?
Holding on to memories of you

And I pray to God
That there's more that we can do, yeah
And I pray to God
That there's more that we can show
More that we can do, yeah



That I can see, a change in me
But I won't look back
Cos that's behind me
And after all,
Strong words are spoken
My heart will never be, never be
Never be broken...



That I can see, a change in me
But I won't look back
Cos that's behind me
And after all
Strong words are spoken
My heart will never be, never be
Never be broken...
