I’ve tried so hard to tell you
These things I’ve heard about you
In your stars
They tear you apart
I’ve lied so hard to fool you
All these things come back to haunt
You in the dark
They tear you apart
I’ve had a good day
Doing things the wrong way
Had a good day doing things the wrong way
Had a good day doing things the wrong way

You’re my undercover lover
You get your kicks for free
And you won’t ever find another
Who’s even half as good as me
You’re my undercover lover
You get your kicks for free
Now get away cause this is killing me

The heat under your collar
A waistband made of dollars
Chills your heart
It’s somewhere to start
You save to be a scholar
And you read your books and squalor
In the dark
We walk in the park
I’ve had a good day
Doing things the wrong way
Had a good day doing things the wrong way
Had a good day doing things the wrong way

You’re my undercover lover
You get your kicks for free
And you won’t ever find another
Who’s even half as good as me
You’re my undercover lover
You get your kicks for free
Now get away
Away 

Just forget about it 

You’re my undercover lover
You get your kicks for free
And you won’t ever find another
Who’s even half as good as me
You’re my undercover lover
You get your kicks for free
Now get away oh this is killing me
Oh this is killing me

You’re my undercover lover
You get your kicks for free
And you won’t ever find another
Who’s even half as good as me
You’re my undercover lover
You get your kicks for free
And you won’t ever find another
Who’s even half as good as me
