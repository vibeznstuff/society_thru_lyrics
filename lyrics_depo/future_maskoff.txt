Call it how it is
Hendrix
I promise, I swear, I swear
You heard
Spit it
Yo

Percocets, Molly, Percocets
Percocets, Molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
(never chase no bitches)
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, Molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

Two cups, toast up with the gang
From food stamps to a whole 'nother domain
Out the bottom, I'm a livin' proof (Super)
They compromising, half a million on the coupe
Drug houses, lookin' like Peru
Graduated, I was overdue
Pink Molly, I can barely move
Ask about me, I'm gon' bust a move
Rick James, 33 chains
Ocean air, crusin' Biscayne
Top off, that's a liability
Hit the gas, boostin' my adrenaline

Percocets, Molly, Percocets
Percocets, Molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
(never chase no bitches)
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, Molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

Four-door Maybach, I'd drive anything
Buy my Range, make 'em go insane
(Oh my Lord, praise him be)
My guillotine, drank promethazine
Tec and beams, go to those extremes
Parliament, calamari Wednesday
Parlay in Vegas, we was in attendance
Before the business, Theodore lenses
Theo-Dur prescriptions, focus on the missions
Intermission, never take a break
Switch states, touch down, foreign plates
Ain't no way, ain't no fucking way
We call the play, we didn't come to play
Rob the bank, we gon' rob the game
Again they gang, we gang, but they are not the same (Freebandz)

Percocets, Molly, Percocets (big fines)
Percocets, Molly, Percocets (big fines)
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
(never chase no bitches)
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, Molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Gas gone, never nod off
