Say it's true, pink and blue 
I can share your situation
Been holding our, emotions back
Will only make us cry
If you go, I know, but you know
It ain't so serious anyway
When that cloud arrives we'll live on...

Ocean Drive 
Don't know why you're so blue 
Sun's gonna shine on everything you do 
And the sky is so blue 
Sun's gonna shine on everything you do 

He left you black and blue
Without a word of explanation 
And he took your love for granted and 
He left you high and dry 
But you know someday, 
when you'll wonder what you see in him anyway
When that day arrives we'll live on.. 

Ocean Drive 
Don't know why you're so blue 
Sun's gonna shine on everything you do 
and the sky is so blue 
Sun's gonna shine on everything you do

Don't know why you're so blue 
Sun's gonna shine on everything you do 
and the sky is so blue
The suns gonna shine on everything you do 

Don't know why you're so blue 
Sun's gonna shine on everything you do 
and the sky is so blue 
The suns gonna shine on everything you do
