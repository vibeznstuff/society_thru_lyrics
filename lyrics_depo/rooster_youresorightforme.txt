Well I lost my faith in fellow man
I've been living alone so long
That I dont know who I am
Why did it take so long
Why did it take so long

Ive been waiting a lifetime 
For someone like you to set me free
Why did it take so long
For you to come and rescue me
Why did it take so long
Why did it take so long


Cos youre beautiful and everyone knows it
And youre everything I want you to be
I got sunshine on my face my smile shows  it
Well it cant be wrong 
cos youre so right for me

Youre so right for me
Yeah yeah
Youre so right for me

Well it just dont matter if its wrong or right
I didnt know something could feel so good
Ive been wasting all my time
Why did it take so long
Why did it take so long
