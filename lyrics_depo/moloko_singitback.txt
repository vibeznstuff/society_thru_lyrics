When you are ready I will surrender take me and do as you wish
Have what you want your way's always the best way
I have succumbed to this passive sensation peacefully falling away
I am a zombie your wish will command me, laugh as I fall to my knees

Can I control this empty delusion lost in the fire below?
And you come running your eyes will be open
And when you come back I'll be as you want me, only so eager to please
My little song will keep you beside me thinking your name as I sing

Sing it back to me
Sing it back to me

Now you can't help it if you have been tempted by fruit hanging ripe on the tree
And I feel useless don't care what the truth is you will be here come the day
Truth do you hear me? Don't try to come near me. So tired, I sleep through the light
If you desire to lay here beside me come to my sweet melody

Sing it back to me

Bring it back, sing it back
Bring it back, sing it back to me
Bring it back, sing it back
Bring it back, sing it back to me

Sing it, sing it
Sing it back to me

Bring it back, sing it back
Bring it back, sing it back to me
Bring it back, sing it back
Bring it back, sing it back to me
