Trust me it'll take your heart
Trust me it'll break your heart oh yes
It's so underrated when we say and play in love

Trust me it'll take
It'll take all of it and break your heart
Everyday we pray in love to the God of it

But it's so good (so good), so good to be loved by you
Yes it's so good, so good to be loved by you
Yes it's so good (so good) to be loved by you
Oh and then you know and I talk to you
It's so good, good to be loved by you, yeah

Now when I say take your heart
I'm not talking robbery
I'm talking lots of talks and texts to cause to be
The one we ought to see
Though talks and texts could get the point from A to B
My X Y Z and all across the board
The alphabet the cause to be
The alphabet when tossing lots of nets across the board
It's all on me
Like every eye
Gemini to Aquemini
I don't cry
Eyes up, boots tied up
It's you him and I
Loving by you
Life's through too quick man
We in at 9
Nothing by you
The flights through too quick yea, in the sky

But it's so good, so good to be loved by you
It's so good to be loved by you
So, so good to be loved by you
Yes, it's so good to be loved by you
It's so good to be loved by you

I deserve it all
I've been so hurt before
And it's hard to trust someone

But I do, and it's you, and it's you
And it feels so good so good to be loved by you
Yes it's so good to be loved by you
