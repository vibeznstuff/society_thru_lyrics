There's no money, there's no possessions
Only obsession, I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my obsession

I just want to be heard, loud and clear are my words
Comin' from within, man, tell 'em what you heard
It's about a revolution in your heart and in your mind
You can't find the conclusion,
Life-style and obsession
Diamond rings get you nothing but a life long lesson
And your pocket-book stressin'
You're a slave to the system, working jobs that you hate
For that shit you don't need
It's too bad the world is based on greed
Step back and see, stop thinking about yourself
Start thinking about

There's no money, there's no possession
Only obsession, I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my possession
Take my obsession, I don't need that shit

'Cause everything is nothing and emptiness is in everything
This reality is really just a fucked up dream
With the flesh and the blood that you call your soul
Flip it inside out, it's a big black hole
Take your money, burn it up like an asteroid
Possessions â€’ they are never gonna fill the void
Take it away and learn the best lesson
The heart, the soul, the life, the passion

There's no money, there's no possession
Only obsession, I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my possession
Take my obsession, I don't need that shit

Money, possession, obsession

Present yourself, press your clothes
Comb your hair and clock-in
You just can't win
Just can't win
The things you own, own you now

Take my money, take my possession
Take my obsession, I don't need that shit

Fuck your money, fuck your possession
Fuck your obsession, I don't need that shit

Money, possession, obsession,
I don't need that shit
