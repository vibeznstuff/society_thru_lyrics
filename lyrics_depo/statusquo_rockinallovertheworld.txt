Ah here we are and here we are and here we go
All aboard and we're hitting the road
Here we go, rockin' all over the world

Ah giddy-up and giddy-up and get away
We're going crazy and we're going today
Here we go, rockin' all over the world

And I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-like it, li-li-like
Here we go, rockin' all over the world

I'm gonna tell your mama what you're gonna do
Come on out with your dancing shoes
Here we go, rockin' all over the world

And I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-like it, li-li-like
Here we go, rockin' all over the world

And I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-like it, li-li-like
Here we go, rockin' all over the world

And I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-like it, li-li-like
Here we go, rockin' all over the world
