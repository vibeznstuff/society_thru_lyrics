You've spent too much time sat in your bedroom
On your PC, are you sure that you couldn't 
Have found the time
Swallowed your pride and fitted to jealousy
Well next week, you're trying again
To pull one of your city's men from men
If you not had the internet would you be into them?
I very much doubt so, how would they know so?

What took you so long?
Was there a queue at the post office?
What took you so long?
Was there a dirty double decker stage coach
You just happened to miss

Sometimes I'm bad and sometimes I'm rotten
And sometimes I say things I probably
Should have forgotten of the people and things
Do you know who I am?
I'm like a Morrissey with some strings

What took you so long?
Was there a queue at the post office?
What took you so long?
Was there a dirty double decker stage coach
You just happened to miss

You're always bad and you're always rotten
And then you always say things that you just
Should have forgotten
Or have you had enough
Of your stereotypical bit of the rough?

woah oh oh
woah oh oh
woah oh oh

What took you so long?
Was there a queue at the post office?
What took you so long?
Was there a dirty double decker stage coach
You just happened to miss

woah oh oh
woah oh oh
woah oh oh
woah oh oh oh oh-oh oh ohh
woah oh oh oh oh-oh oh ohh
woah oh oh oh oh-oh oh ohhh
