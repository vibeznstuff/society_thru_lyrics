Go swiftly
The flags and drums can hypnotise
When glory has faded the dream
Is worth more than the prize
A twisting turning flame
And a freedom burning bright
Knows all of the names
And all of the games
Of the yellow black and white
We've gotta have faith
To work it out
Faith and hope
Without any doubt
Give us strenght to make a start
Put a song in our hearts....


We're never gonna break down these walls
And build a prison with the stone
'Cos you and I know what love is worth
We're gonna build heaven on earth
We're running in the wheels of fortune
Turning water into wine
We're gonna take love and make it shine
We're gonna find peace in our time

Softly, softly
When there is lightening in the sky
When the rivers are rising and
Trouble rolls in on the tide
We'll keep on keeping on
'Til all the tears are dry
We'll weather the storm and
Welcome the dawn
Of tomorrow you and I
We've gotta have faith
And get it fast, faith and hope
And make it last
Give us strength
To reach the stars
Put a song in our hearts



We're raisin' the dust
It's heaven or bust
And we'll see this dream come true
We're gonna have faith....(faith)
The road will be long
But there's hope....(hope)
To carry us on
We'll have strength...(strength)
We'll never go wrong
With this song in our hearts



At the sign (sign)
Of the dove
It's gonna shine (shine)
Shine (shine)
Shine (shine)
On a wing
And a prayer
We'll be fine
Fine
Fine
