Another day has come
Can't face it on my own
I almost let you walk away
I guess I should have known
I'll give it to you straight
'Cause some things just can't wait
I've got to make it up to you
And I'll pray it's not too late

'Cause when you look at me
With those sad blue eyes
It stops me cold and I realize
You're all I need tonight

We're halfway to heaven
Lyin' beside you on a night
So still
We're halfway to heaven
I ask you if you'll stay and baby
Say you will

So what's a man to do
To get it through to you
Another lost and lonely night
Would break this heart in two

So let's take a chance
And it'll be alright
Just put your trust in me tonight
Girl we're almost there

We're halfway to heaven
There's something magic
'Bout the way you kiss
We're halfway to heaven
Runnin' with you baby
On a night like this
We're halfway to heaven
I never dreamed that
I could get this high
We're halfway to heaven
Girl I couldn't leave you
Even if I tried

You got me captured
In a crazy spin
You got me so I just
Can't tell the shape I'm in
