Every little thing I do,
Can it be I do it for you?
Every word I say is true,
Anything I do, I do for you.

'Cos when you hold me in your arms,
I feel so safe and warm,
I love you true...

Baby can't you see you will always be
My little bit of heaven
Baby can't you see you will always be
My life
Baby can't you see you were meant to be
My little bit of heaven
So it's you and me, &amp; I can't believe my eyes

There's so little I can do,
When you put your kisses on me
I just melt into my shoes &amp; everything I feel is due to you

'Cos when you hold me in your arms,
I feel so safe and warm,
I love you true...

Baby can't you see you will always be
My little bit of heaven
Baby can't you see you will always be
My life
Baby can't you see you were meant to be
My little bit of heaven
So it's you and me, &amp; I can't believe my eyes

You take me to another place,
Out of myself &amp; into your arms
And you make me feel no other way will do,
will do

Baby can't you see you will always be
My little bit of heaven
Baby can't you see you will always be
My life
Baby can't you see you were meant to be
My little bit of heaven
So it's you and me, &amp; I can't believe my eyes
