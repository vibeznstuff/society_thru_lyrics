I would do just about anything
Well I used to have what I would call
A very limited vocabulary
And the only two words
I could wrap my tongue around
Were i and me
But now I feel so clever
That you would swear I ate a dictionary
And the new word that I've added
Brings up my words to three
What am I gonna do
Word number three is you

I would do anything, anything
I would do anything, anything
Anything to be with you
Anything you asked me to
I would do anything, anything
Just about anything, anything
Anything to be with you
Anything you asked me to

Oh the meaning of my feelings
It is not written in no dictionary
And I've tried to find the meaning
In a phrase book or two
Well there are somethings you can only say
If you have a healthy body
So come on, baby, let's talk together
For a day or two
You know what I will do
For a day or two
You know what I will do
You know what I need from you

I would do anything, anything
I would do anything, anything
Anything to be with you
Anything you asked me to
I would do anything, anything
Just about anything, anything
Anything to be with you
Anything you asked me to

Won't you come back, won't you run back
Won't come back and play with me
Won't you run back, won't you run back
Won't you run back and stay with me

I'd do anything, anything
Just about anything, anything
Anything to be with you
Anything you asked me to

I would do anything, anything
Just about anything, anything
Anything to be with you
Anything you asked me to

I would do anything, anything
Just about anything

I would do, do, do, do, do
