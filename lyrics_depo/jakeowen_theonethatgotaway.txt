She rolled in my little sandy town
She spent the summer there a couple houses down
Well, there was magic in the air
When she caught my eye
We shared three short months
And one long goodbye

She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I shoulda never let her go
I shoulda begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
Yeah, the one that got away

Well, she kissed my lips
Down on Ocean Drive
She set my world on fire
On the fourth of July
We wrote our names in the sand
Under the star-soaked sky
But it washed away like she did
With the rising tide

She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I shoulda never let her go
I shoulda begged her to stay
She was the one that got away

Every summer that rolls around
I'm looking over my shoulder
Wishing I can see her face
Wishing I could hold her

She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I shoulda never let her go
I shoulda begged her to stay
She was the one that got away

Yeah, she was the one that got away
Yeah, she wrecked my heart
I shoulda never let her go
I shoulda begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
She was the one that got away

She rolled in my little sandy town
She spent the summer there a couple houses down
