Another night out, another dancefloor
Another night out, another dancefloor
Another night out, another dancefloor
(Move for you)
Another night out, another dancefloor

Here we go, another night out
Waited all week just to get out
Where do we come from, do I know your name?
Doesn't really matter, in this life we're all the same

Move for me, I'll move for you
Move for me, I'll move for you
Move for me, I'll move for you
Move for me, I'll move for you

A DJ, a light show
Speakers putting up, as we go
This way and that way, getting past the name
Doesn't really matter, in this life we're all the same

Move for you, I'll move for you
Move for me, I'll move for you
Move for me, I'll move for you

Another night out, another dancefloor
Another night out, another dancefloor
Another night out, another dancefloor
(Move for me)
Another night out, another dancefloor
(Move for me)

Another night out, another dancefloor
(Move for me, I'll move for you)
Another night out, another dancefloor
(Move for me, I'll move for you)
Another night out, another dancefloor
