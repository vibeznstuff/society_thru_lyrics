Uh uh
Hey baby how you
Why your face lookin' all sad and blue
Don't you like the Navigator truck that I brought you
Why you trying to act a fool
Don't try to say you seen me talking to your girlfriends
Ask Tonya and Shirl then
Gimme a place and time when
Don't try to accuse me of silly stuff that I'm doing on the streets
You gotta remember, without you, there's no me
I'm just an average man
Tryin' to make it in this cold world
Tell me baby, why you trippin', girl


I don't wanna fuss with you 
So I'm gonna sit out on the couch 
Don't try to talk to me 
'Cause boy I am locking you out 
I don't wanna hear a thing 
Nothin' you got to say 
You should think twice 
About the way you been talkin'to me 

Better catch a cab or get on the bus 
I ain't got no time for you 
Talkin' all that junk 
I'm gonna pack my stuff 
Is this what you want 
I don't really care 
Cause there's no more us 

Ain't got no words for you 
So you can stop calling my friends 
Tellin' them it wasn't your fault 
And why I ain't lettin' you in 
Too many times before 
I've let you back in my life 
This is a new day 
And this won't go down tonight 

Better catch a cab or get on the bus 
I ain't got no time for you 
Talkin' all that junk 
I'm gonna pack my stuff 
Is this what you want 
I don't really care 
Cause there's no more us 

Introduced you to Dolce and Gabanna 
Took you from dirt bikes to Hondas 
Take you from that terrible stress 
Now you tellin' me that I am a bother 
What kinda mess is that to tell a man who put you on the scene 
That's just like killing a dream (oh no baby) 
That's how it seems 
I work hard to build up what I have of you 
I pray to God there's not another man between me and you 
So tell me baby 
There's no need to lie 
Why you sleepin' with your eyes closed 
Wanna talk alright yo 

Better catch a cab or get on the bus 
I ain't got no time for you 
Talkin' all that junk 
I'm gonna pack my stuff 
Is this what you want 
I don't really care 
Cause there's no more us
