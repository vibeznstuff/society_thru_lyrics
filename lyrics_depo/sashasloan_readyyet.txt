I know you know that you messed up
I see it in your eyes
I know you wanna start over
But sorry, can't change time

It's hard for me to be mad at you
I don't wanna be
It's hard for me to be mad at you
'Cause there's part of me that loves you still
Loves you still
Always will, you know

I just wanna be your friend again
But there's some shit I can't forget
I don't think I'm ready yet
I just want the bad feelings to end
But there's some shit I can't forget
I don't think I'm ready yet
Hit me up another time
Maybe one day I'll change my mind
You know that I just wanna be your friend again
But there's some shit I can't forget
I don't think I'm ready yet
I don't think I'm ready yet

I don't think I'm ready yet

Sometimes I just wanna call you
But the time is never right
Even though I really want to
I can't leave it behind

It's hard for me to be mad at you
I don't wanna be
It's hard for me to be mad at you
'Cause there's part of me that loves you still
Loves you still
Always will, you know

I just wanna be your friend again
But there's some shit I can't forget
I don't think I'm ready yet
I just want the bad feelings to end
But there's some shit I can't forget
I don't think I'm ready yet
Hit me up another time
Maybe one day I'll change my mind
You know that I just wanna be your friend again
But there's some shit I can't forget
I don't think I'm ready yet
I don't think I'm ready yet

All that I want is to take you back
Sorry, my heart doesn't work like that
I don't think I'm ready yet
All that I want is to take you back
Sorry, my heart doesn't work like that
I just wanna be your friend again
Ooh, I just wanna be your friend again

I just wanna be your friend again
Maybe one day I'll change my mind
You know that I just wanna be your friend again
But there's some shit I can't forget
I don't think I'm ready yet
I don't think I'm ready yet

I just wanna be your friend again
I don't think I'm ready yet
Be your friend
I just wanna be your friend again
