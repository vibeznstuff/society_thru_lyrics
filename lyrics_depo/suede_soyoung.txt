Because we're young, because we're gone
we'll take the tide's electric mind, oh yeah? oh yeah

we're so young and so gone, let's chase the dragon, oh

Because we're youn, because we're gone
We'll scare the skies with tiger's eyes, oh yeah? oh yeah

we're so young and so gone, let's chase the dragon, oh
let's chase the dragon...

...from our home high in the city where the skyline
stained the snow, I fell for a servant who kept me on the boil

We're so young and so gone, let's chase the dragon from our home!
