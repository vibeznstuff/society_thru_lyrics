Deep in the shadows of your deepest secrets
I sleep next to the precepts you hold most dear
Your heart is in my province hour upon hour
I shiver when you feel the cold, 
Everything you say I hear

Like a bomb and its fuse, 
We bring bright light
But I could be a devil to you
I could bite like a tarantula
Right through the skin
And leave my poison dripping 
Deliciously unsuspecting
Protecting you from all harm
Except perhaps from these arms 
That hold you
