Hearts gone astray, deep in her when they go. 
I went away just when you needed me so. 
You won't regret, I'll come back begging you. (mmm) 
Won't you forget, welcome the love we once knew. 

Open up your eyes, then you realise. 
Here I stand with my everlasting love. 
Need you by my side. 
Girl to be my pride. 
Never be denied everlasting love.... 

oh...

Everlasting love......
