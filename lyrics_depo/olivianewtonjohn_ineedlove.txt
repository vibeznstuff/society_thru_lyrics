It's nothing personal
In other circumstances
Another place, another time
I would take my chances

Oh, I know I could take you home tonight
But I don't want to wake up with you, wishing I was alone
Ah, don't rush, cause when the timing's right, I'll know
I wanna be sure
I just can't play the game anymore

I'm not looking for a band-aid on loneliness
I'm not looking for a temporary get-me-through-the-night
I'm holding out for something more than physical
I need love to make the sex right

It's nothing personal
In other circumstances
Another place, another time
And I might take my chances

I want you, and I'm not hiding from the way I feel
I've been trying to fill this empty heart with something not real
And I don't want to live like that anymore
In a world gone crazy, these days you've really got to be sure

So I'm not looking for a band-aid on loneliness
I'm not looking for a temporary get-me-through-the-night
I'm holding out for something more than physical
I need love to make the sex right

Times are different than before
Good things are worth waiting for

It's nothing personal
In other circumstances
Another place, another time

No I'm not looking for a band-aid on loneliness
I'm not looking for a temporary get-me-through-the-night
I'm holding out for something more than physical
I need love to make the sex right
I need love (it's nothing personal)

I'm not looking for a band-aid on loneliness
I'm not looking for a temporary get-me-through-the-night
I'm holding out for something more than physical
I need love to make it feel right
(It's nothing personal)

I'm not looking for a band-aid on loneliness
I'm not looking for a temporary get-me-through-the-night
I'm holding out for something more than physical
I need love to make the sex right
