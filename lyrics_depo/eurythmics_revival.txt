Well I passed you by this morning
You were stumblin' down the street
And by the look upon your face
I could tell you wasn't
Feeling too sweet -

You dropped down to the bottom -
That's what you
Gone and did -
Livin' in a bad dream
Finally flipped your lid

Well - Superman I've got
News for you
And every body else
That's listenin' too
There's a new way out
If yer ready to hear
We're gonna make it clear

What we need is revival!
Revival.

Look at that girl
She's the saddest thing
You've ever seen -
Washed up and faded
Like a dirty old pair of jeans

She's running round in circles
But she don't have a single friend -
Looks like her own bitterness
Has twisted her till the end

Well - Mona Lisa look me in the eye
And tell me when
You're gonna get satisfied
I'm gonna spell it out
Right in front of you
This is what you have to do -

Get ready for revival!
Revival...
R.E.V.I.V.A.L.
It's gonna lift you
Right up
From your prison cell
Play it out loud
Like a ringing bell
You go
R.E.V.I.V.A.L.
