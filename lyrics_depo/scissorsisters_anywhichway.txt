Dancing on the speakers, are you peaking with tweakers
Bigger, tanner breeders on the scene
The night don't last forever, so get your shit together
Open arms are never what they seem

Oh oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh

I don't need a doctor just a simple love concocter
To slide to my side so civilly
No talk of commitment
When I receive a shipment
Oh I need express delivery

Any which way, any which way,
You better take me, any which way you can
Any which way, any which way,
You better take me, any which way you can

Ya' don't need reservations
No identification
To give me your relations
Sting me like a bee
Oh I want you to funk me
Your battleship has sunk me
You dip me and you dunk me
Set my body free

Any which way, any which way
You better take me, any which way you can
Any which way, any which way
You better take me, any which way you can

You know baby
When I was taking my pantyhose out of their egg this evening
I thought: I'm going to find that man that is the right shade of bottle tan
A man that smells like cocoa butter and cash
Take me anyway you like it
In front of the fireplace
In front of your yacht
In front of my parents
I don't give a damn baby, just take me

Any which way, any which way, any which way you can
Any which way, any which way you can
Any which way, any which way, any which way you can
Any which way, any which way you can

Any which way, any which way
You better take me, any which way you can
Any which way, any which way
You better take me, any which way you can

Ah any which way you can
Ah any which way you can

Any which way, any which way
You better take me, any which way you can
Any which way, any which way
You better take me, any which way you can

Any which way, any which way
(Any which way, any which way, any which way you can)
You better take me, any which way you can
(Any which way, any which way you can)
Any which way, any which way
(Any which way, any which way, any which way you can)
You better take me, any which way you can
(Any which way, any which way you can)
