Now, first of all I wanna let you know that
I've been known for some minor moodswings now and then
It all started back when people were doing me wrong and
Because of my position I would hold my tongue for them

Bad relationships and people I thought were friends and
People judging me before they get to know a thing
When you decide to step to me, it shows me so clearly
You just wanna see, see the other side of me

And you don't know what I'm going through and
You might think it's all about you
But it's everything, I've been hoping that
It's just bad timing to come at me like that

I try to keep my cool, thus, that's what I try to do but
It's so hard dealing with people just like you
I try to walk away from situations that run
Into complications that make me lose control

If I give in to you then it's what you want me to do
And if I lose my cool then I'm only pleasing you
You know just how to push me, my temperature is rising
Blood pressure is building, I'm about to lose control

And you don't know what I'm going through and
You might think it's all about you
But it's everything I've been hoping that
It's just bad timing to come at me like that

I'm sorry, I, did I cross the line
I tried to warn you away, way ahead of time
I'm so frustrated that I feel like I could cry
This could be the time but I'm not going out like that

And you don't know what I'm going through and
You might think it's all about you
But it's everything I've been hoping that
It's just bad timing to come at me like that

And you don't know what I'm going through and
You might think it's all about you
But it's everything I've been hoping that
It's just bad timing to come at me like that

To come at me like that
To come at me like that
To come at me like that
