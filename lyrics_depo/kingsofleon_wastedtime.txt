It's your life
Don't you let em tell you when to bat your eyes
You're the only one who's gonna sacrifice
Makes no difference if you're right or wrong
Take that ride
But I want your little sister by your side
Maybe little later we can all collide
Do our livin' like a rollin' stone
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted 


Innocent smile
Runnin' free
Baby's gonna give it like it used to be

Show your face
Livin' in the shadows like you got no name
Enough to make a little girly go insane
Be my guest to let it out tonight
It's ok
I know all about the little games you play
Shakin' your apple right in my face
Only when you know that I'm beggin' fort a bite
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted 



So won't you show your face (show your face)
Your little apple shake (show your face)
I know the love you gave (show your face)
I know the love you take (show your face)


Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted
