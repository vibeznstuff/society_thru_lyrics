Well sometimes I will
Then again, I think I won't
Whoa, sometimes I will
Then again, I think I won't
Sometimes I do
Then again, I think I don't

Ah well, I looked at my watch
And it was nine twenty-one
We're at a rock 'n roll dance
Havin' nothin' but fun

And we rolled
Oh, reelin' and a-rockin'
We was reelin' and a-rockin'
Rollin' till the break of dawn

Ah well, I looked at my watch
And it was nine thirty-two
There's nothing I'd rather do
Than dance with you

And we rolled
Oh, reelin' and a-rockin'
I was reelin' and a-rockin'
Rollin' till the break of dawn

Ah well, I looked at my watch
And it was nine forty-three
And at the time I spent
She spent with me

And we rolled
Oh, reelin' and a-rockin'
I was reelin' and a-rockin'
Rollin' till the break of dawn

Ah well, I looked at my watch
And it was nine fifty-four

Ready to go, go, go

And we rolled
Oh, reelin' and a-rockin'
I was reelin' and a-rockin'
Rollin' till the break of dawn

Ah well, I looked at my watch
And it was ten twenty-six
I gotta keep on dancin'
Till I get my kicks

And we rolled
Oh, reelin' and a-rockin'
I was reelin' and a-rockin'
Rollin' till the break of dawn

Ah well, I looked at my watch
And it was ten O-five
My mother didn't know
If I was dead or alive

And we rolled
Oh, reelin' and a-rockin'
I was reelin' and a-rockin'
Rollin' till the break of dawn

I looked at my watch
And it was ten twenty-nine
I had to hold her hand
She was still holdin' mine

And we rolled
Oh, reelin' and a-rockin'
I was reelin' and a-rockin'
Rollin' till the break of dawn

I looked at my watch
It took me by surprise
I was dancin' with a woman
That was twice my size

And we rolled
Oh, reelin' and a-rockin'
Well we was reelin' and a-rockin'
Rollin' till the break of dawn

I looked at my watch
And it was time to go

No more

And we rolled
Oh, reelin' and a-rockin'
I was reelin' and a-rockin'
Rollin' till the break of dawn
