Working on the weekend, baby.
She's working all through the night.
A jump into the deep end gave her
The evidence she required.
Takes five; she's got pearls.
Don't fake it when it comes to making money.
So she smiles. But that's cruel.
If you know what she thinks
If you knew what she was after.

Sometimes she wonders, 
And she laughs in her frustration.


Would someone please explain 
The reason for this strange behaviour.
In exploitation's name 
We must be working for the Skin Trade.

Doctors of the revolution gave us 
The medicine we desired.
Besides being absolutely painless 
It's a question of compromise.
They got steel. 
So cool to get angry at the weekend
And go back to school.
So big deal; it's what rules.
When it comes to making money, 
Say yes, please; thank you.

Sometimes you wonder, and ask yourself the question.



I know the answer, but I'm asking you the question.
