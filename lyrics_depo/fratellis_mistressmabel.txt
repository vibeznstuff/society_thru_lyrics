Mistress Mabel seriously wrong
Clears my table badly then she's gone
Takes a liberty if you let her
Yes she's bold but she should know better
Oh dear Mabel please don't put me on

Mistress Mabel all the kids agree
You're unstable curious and free
Wind them down and then keep them kickin
Sunken eyed and all panic stricken
Oh dear mabel it still worries me

Hem line rat bag so they told her 
Last nights name tag across her shoulder

And tell me where all the days have gone
When you robbed my cradle tell me Mabel
Where'd you go when you can't go on
With this filthy fable tell me Mabel

Mistress Mabel won't you marry me?
I'm unable to take it seriously
I'll be good and you'll be a minute
I wish you would or I'll drop you in it
Oh dear Mabel won't you marry me?

Hem line rat bag so they told her 
Last nights name tag across her shoulder,

And tell me where all the days have gone
When you robbed my cradle tell me Mabel
Where'd you go when you can't go on
With this filthy fable tell me Mabel
Tell me Mabel tell me Mabel
