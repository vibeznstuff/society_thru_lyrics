SOME BOYS GOT THE LOOK OF THE GREEK ADONIS
SOME BOYS TRY TALK YOU OFF YOUR FEET
SOME BOYS THINK THEY`RE GODS GIFT TO WOMEN
SOME BOYS THINK THEY`RE SWEET ENOUGH TO EAT

TRY TO CHANGE THE HABIT OF A LIFETIME
DON`T EVEN TRY
`COS WHEN YOU CUT DOWN DEEPER THAN THE ICING
YOU REALISE


WHAT YOU GET IS WHAT YOU SEE
AIN`T NOTHING MORE TO IT
AND IF YOU WANNA LOVE A WOMAN LIKE ME
IT TAKES A MAN TO DO IT
IF WHAT YOU GET IS WHAT YOU SEE
WHEN I DON`T WANT YOUR KIND OF LOVE

SOME GUYS GOT LIPS THAT YOU CAN`T HELP KISSING
SOME GUYS GOTTA SMILE THAT YOU CAN`T RESIST
SOME GUYS GOTTA BUILD A REPUTATION
THEY JUST WANNA ADD YOU TO THE LIST

YOU GOTTA LOT OF PHYSICAL ATTRACTION
I CAN`T DENY
BUT CAN YOU GUARANTEE ME SATISFACTION
WELL I`M STILL WAITING, WAITING, WAITING, WAITING, WAITING



SO LET ME SEE YOUR CARDS ON THE TABLE
BEFORE I BUY
I ALWAYS READ THE WRITING ON THE LABEL
SO GIVE ME REASON TO BELIVE THERE`S MORE TO YOU
THAN MEETS THE EYE



THERE`S NOTHING MORE TO IT
IT TAKES A MAN, TAKES A MAN
I DON`T WANT YOUR KIND OF LOVE
THERE`S NOTHING MORE TO IT
