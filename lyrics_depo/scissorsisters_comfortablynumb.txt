Hello (hello) 
Hello (hello) 
Is there anybody in there? 
Just nod if you can here me 
Is there anybody home? 

Come on now 
I hear you're feeling down 
Well I can ease your pain 
And get you on your feet again 
Relax... 
I need some information.. first (first) 
Relax.. 
Just don't face the facts 
Can you show me where it hurts 

 
There is no pain you were receding 
A distant ship floats on the horizon 
You're only coming through in waves 
Your lips move but I can't hear watcha saying 
When I was a child I caught a fever 
My hands swelled like two balloons 
Now i've got that feeling once again 
I can't explain
You would not understand
This isn't how I am 
I have become comfortably numb

Ok (ok) 
It's just a little pin-prick 
There'll be no more Hiiiiiiiiiii 
But you may feel a little sick 
Can you stand up now 
I do believe It's working 
(uh huh) (uh huh) 

Gotta keep it going through the show 
C'mon it's time to go  

 
There is no pain you were receding 
A distant ship floats on the horizon 
You're only coming through in waves 
Your lips move but I can't hear watcha saying 
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse 
Out of the corner of my eye 
I turned to look but it was gone 
To get up on my feet but ohh the child has grown 
The dream is gone 
I..i..i've been Com-com-fortably Numb 
I..i..i've been Com-com-fortably Numb
