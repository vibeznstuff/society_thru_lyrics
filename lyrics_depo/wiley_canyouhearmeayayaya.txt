I was on a path to the limelight
Now I'm on another one, it's a night flight
When they say I'm a star I say thank you
It's all due to the scenes that I ran through
So I keep flyin the flags for all people
No messing about we're all equal
Vibe alive in the club when I roll in
I get around with the crowd when I'm roaming


Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayayaya, ayayaya
Ayayaya, ayayaya
Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayayaya, ayayaya
Ayayaya, ayayaya


They should know I bring vibes on a club night
Keep the crowd hyped up brother party
Red, she wanna say words in my earlobe
Reminds me there's an hour of the party left
See the fireworks, celebration
Team winning the Grey Goose amazing
Send them Jaeger bombs I got a craving
So many women I don't wanna stop raving
They should know I got tunes for the gyal dem
Once the ladies are there, see the man dem reach
They wanna leave there with a number
Check the peng ting she's gonna hang with me
I'm skanking all-round the party I'm skanking
I got girls to the left and girls to the right
When we're at the bar we ain't ramping


Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayayaya, ayayaya
Ayayaya, ayayaya
Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayayaya, ayayaya
Ayayaya, ayayaya


Wiley called me on the iPhone
He said get my passport told me to come through
Put your sun cream in your suitcase
When I arrive I'm causing a heat wave too
Got my SnapBack and my vest on
Looking at the hot girl with the red dress on
Light skin with a beautiful body like Kim
So I had to get my Kanye West on
She told me she's feeling my jewellery
She said that she's in love with my Jesus piece
I told her to look again closely
It's not Jesus baby it's JME
And I was like babe come over
I don't bite girl come a little closer
Come a little closer
I don't bite girl come a little closer


Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayayaya, ayayaya
Ayayaya, ayayaya


You know I don't usually party
But Skepta and Wiley said it's a hype
I can't find my phone or my car keys
Like Zippy Tafari said on the mic
The vibe is off the Richter
And I can't even tweet a picture
I'm on the dance floor the joke is I never had a drink
But I'm acting the drunkest
She's staring like I'm a weirdo
Or then again maybe she likes me
I'm not supposed to be here though
Haven't got a wrist band for the VIP
No triple A pass but I'm partying with the stars
Yep, I can't complain I just enjoy it while it lasts


Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayayaya, ayayaya
Ayayaya, ayayaya
Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayayaya, ayayaya
Ayayaya, ayayaya
