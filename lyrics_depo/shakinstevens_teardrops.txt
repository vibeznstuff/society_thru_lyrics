Teardrops will fall because of you, teardrops will fall for only you
I want you so, oh you'll never know how much I need you

Teardrops will fall if you don't need me, teardrops will fall oh please believe me
I want you so, oh you'll never know how much I need you

As long as there's a moon above
There will be the two of us
If you and I were meant to be
Tell me you love me and I'll be your only

Teardrops will fall don't run and hide, teardrops will fall stay by my side
I want you so, oh you'll never know how much I need you

As long as there's a moon above
There will be the two of us
If you and I were meant to be
Tell me you love me and I'll be your only

Teardrops will fall, oh teardrops will fall
Oh yeah, teardrops will fall, teardrops will fall
Tear, tear will fall, teardrops will fall.
