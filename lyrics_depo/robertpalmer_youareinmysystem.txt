Day by day and night by night
I feel you in my mind
It happens all the time
You know the day dreams stop
My heart beats on
I can't take it any more
It's you I live for 
You are in my system
You are in my system 
I just want you to know that,
You are in my system 
You oooohhhh you're in my system, system
Don't you, Don't you, don't you know that, babe.
I will keep on pushing, pushing, pushing
Until I get through
My main objective baby is to get to you
To turn your mind around
I know will take time
But you know I can wait, now
You're on my mind
You are in my system 
I just want you to know that,
You are in my system 
Got me burning, I'm on fire
You, you're in my system
You're everything I need
You, oooohhhh, you're in my system, system
Don't you, Don't you, don't you know that, babe.
It's a romantic vision of me and you
It happens all the time
My dreams are filled with you
There's no doubt in my mind
That I'll be true baby
You know I'll take you out
And I'll keep lovin' you
Oh baby you are in my system,
I just want you to know that
You are in my system 
Cut me right down to the wire
You, ooohh, you're in my system
Got me burning I'm on fire
You, you're in my system
Can't make believe
You, you're in my system
You're everything I need
You, ooohh, you're in my system
I just want you to know that
You, you're my system
Got me burning I'm on fire
You, you're in my system
