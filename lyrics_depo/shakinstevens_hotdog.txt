My baby works in a hot dog stand, makin' them hot dogs as fast as she can
Up steps a cat, now don't be slow, get me two hot dogs ready to go

Hot dog, she's my baby, hot dog, drives me crazy
Hot dog,don't mean maybe, you ought to see my baby in a hot dog stand

In the cool of the evening when the sun goes down, all the cats and the chicks all gather round
They order hot dogs and red soda pop, then they head downtown to a hep cat hop

Hot dog, she's my baby, hot dog, drives me crazy
Hot dog,don't mean maybe, you ought to see my baby in a hot dog stand

I'm waiting for my baby every night at twelve, she closes up the top and then we lose ourselves
At a hep cat hop any crazy way, we're doin' the bop till the break of day

Hot dog, she's my baby, hot dog, drives me crazy
Hot dog,don't mean maybe, you ought to see my baby in a hot dog stand

Now the cats here and how been hangin' around, trying to get my baby, trying to put me down
She either don't hear, she either don't care, maybe it's the way that I brush my hair

Hot dog, she's my baby, hot dog, drives me crazy
Hot dog,don't mean maybe, you ought to see my baby in a hot dog stand.
