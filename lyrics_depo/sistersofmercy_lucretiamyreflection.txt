I hear the roar of the big machine
Two worlds and in between
Hot metal and methedrine
I hear your empire down
I hear your empire down

I hear the roar of the big machine
Two worlds and in between
Love lost, fire at will
Dum-dum bullets and shoot to kill, I hear
Dive bombers, and
Empire down
Empire down

I hear the sounds of the city and dispossessed
Get down, get undressed
Get rid of you and me
We got the kingdom, we got the key
We got the empire, now as then
We don't doubt, we don't take direction
Lucretia, my reflection, dance the ghost with me

We look hard
We look through
We look hard to see for real
Such things I hear, they don't make sense
I don't see much evidence
I don't feel. I don't feel. I don't Feel

A long train held up by page on page
A hard reign held up by rage
Once a railroad
Now it's done...

I hear the roar of the big machine
Two worlds and in between
Hot metal and methedrine
I hear your empire down...

We got the empire, now as then
We don't doubt, we don't take reflection
Lucretia, my direction, dance the ghost with me...
