Take a picture of tonight
And keep it by your heart
Love has left us memories
There's no better way to part
I will find another love
Someone who won't bring me down
How you tried to level me
But you never stood your ground
Fortunately I got wise this time
Fortunately I got me on my mind
I just want to be loved
Don't want to fight you baby
But I'm much too proud
to say it loud
I just want to be loved
Don't want to beg you baby
But I'm much too proud
to shout it out
Take a piece of dignity
And use it in your life
Even though you hurt me
I still want you to survive
Love was never special
We were never down
You will always have someone
To bring you on the ground
Fortunately I got wise this time
Fortunately I got me on my mind
I just want to be loved
Don't want to fight you baby
But I'm much too proud to say it loud
I just want to be loved
Don't want to beg you baby
But I'm much too proud
to shout it out
When you love someone
Don't you know
love is blind
When you love someone
It'll be for all time
That's right
