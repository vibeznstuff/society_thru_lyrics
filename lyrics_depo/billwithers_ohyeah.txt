Sometimes you stare and the look that's in your eyes
Says that you care and gives me butterflies

Oh yeah! What a pure delight
Oh yeah! I'm in love alright
Oh yeah! What a perfect night
Why don't we stay here together?

Sometimes it's there in the way you say hello
Sometimes the answer is yes when you say no

Oh yeah! What a pure delight
Oh yeah! I'm in love alright
Oh yeah! What a perfect night
Why don't we stay here together?
Why don't you stay forever in my life

Time for the shoes and rice
‘Cause I think you're very nice
And I want you in my life, oh baby!

Oh yeah! What a pure delight
Oh yeah! I'm in love alright
Oh yeah! What a perfect night
Why don't we stay here together?
Why don't you stay forever in the night
