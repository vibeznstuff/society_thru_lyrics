Lets go
So  so you think you can tell
heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
from a cold steel rail
A smile from a veil
do you think you can tell
Did they get you to trade
your heros for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change
Did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
for a lead role in the cage

whether you listenin to hip hip-hop
or you tuning to rock
refugees on your box
we gonna take over ya blocks

lets go
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're jus two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl year after year
Runnin over the same old ground
What have we found the same old fears
Wish you were here

whether you listenin to rock
or pumpin the hip hip hop
refugees on your box

Critics don't mistake this for just any cover tune
I'ma take y'all to the dark side of the moon
Kickin in my moms room this song was just a thought
A young refugee labeled, jus come with a passport
Dad used to tell me about the American dream
My dream was waking up the projects
a young teen listening to hip hop
my brother tune me into rock
put me up on pink floyd and banned from the british blocks

whether you pumpin the hip hip hop
or you tuning to rock
refugees on your box
we gonna take over the blocks
from n.j to bk to the u.k
