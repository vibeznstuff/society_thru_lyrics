Why? Why?

How many times do I have to try to tell you
That I'm sorry for the things I've done
But when I start to try to tell you
That's when you have to tell me
Hey this kind of trouble's only just begun

I tell myself too many times
Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
That keep on falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth, falling from your mouth

Tell me, why? Why?

I may be mad, I may be blind
I may be viciously unkind
But I can still read what you're thinking
Let's go down to the water's edge

And we can cast away those doubts
Some things are better left unsaid
But they still turn me inside out
Turning inside out turning inside out

Tell me, why?
Why? Tell me
Why you don't know?
Why you don't know?

This is the book I never read
These are the words I never said
This is the path I'll never tread
These are the dreams I'll dream instead

And these are the years that we have spent
And this is what they represent
And this is how I feel, do you know how I feel?
'Cause I don't think you know how I feel
I don't think you know what I feel

Why you don't know?
Why you don't know what I feel?
Why you don't knew?
Why don't know what I feel?

Why?
