Hey boys, it's a steal
You're hanging on, by your finger nails
As usual, the king is dead
Long live the queens
Hey girls, no big deal
You're fifteen minutes
Start right here, so baby let's go
Let's go...

I'm watching the world,
I'm taking my time
I've waited my turn
Now I'm gonna shine

Heroes take their toll
Hog your dreams, then crush your soul
And take you out, out to dinner
Roll on the original
Highly strung out, spaced out individual
I'm a terminal sinner

I'm watching the world,
I'm taking my time
I've waited my turn
Now I'm gonna shine

And all the pretty people that I used to see
Have died or moved away
Or they're in recovery
And all the buildings where the faithless used to play
Have crumbled into clay
And I don't know what to say,
I just don't know what to say

I'm watching the world,
I'm taking my time
I've waited my turn
Now I'm gonna shine

I declare my innocence,
I'm worth more than 60 pence
Look, I've got a shiny car,
I Can Drive, I can drive, Yes, baby, I'm for real
That's just the way I feel
I can take a ride anytime

Everything I pass is old,
Everything I touch is gold,
Now I see the world unfold,
I Can drive, I can drive

Yes baby, it's a steal,
Nothing that you see is real,
Get yourself a pair of wheels,
Learn to drive, come on
