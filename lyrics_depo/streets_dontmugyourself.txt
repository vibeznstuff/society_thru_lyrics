A new day another morning after, leaning back on my chair in a greasy spoon cafeteria
Last night was some beer laryness done our way but again we're back in the light of day
Chatting shit, sitting at the wall table telling jokes playing with the salt, lookin' out the window
Girl brings 2 plates of full English over with plenty of scrambled eggs and plenty of fried tomato
Get my phone out, 'bout to give this girl a shout, see if she had a nice time last night up town
Ask if she fancies trying it again sometime then Cal grabs the phone like oi oi oi!

Hold it down boy, your head's getting blurred
I know you can't stop thinking of her
By all means you can vibe with this girl
But just don't mug yourself, that's all don't mug yourself!

Seriously Mick you fucker
No no no Cos ya know what I mean
Don't mug yourself
I'm fucking, I'm know way really d'ya know what I mean
I can take it or leave it, believe, and then Calvins like oi

You need to hold it down Jack, put your phone back
Quit staring into space and eat your snack, that's that
She'll want you much for not hanging on
Stop me if I'm wrong, stop me if I'm wrong
Why should she be the one who decides whether its off or on or on or off or on
Now the girl's rude, I know she's rude but she screwed right through you, you'll be on your
knees soon

Hold it down boy, your head's getting blurred
I know you cant stop thinking of her
By all means you can vibe with this girl
Bust just don't mug yourself, that's all don't mug yourself!
And I'm like, honestly it's not like that, your acting like I'm prancing like a sap
Jumping when she claps and that, oi
Do you really think I act wack cos I'm tellin' ya serving the aces and it's game set and match
Perfectly in control of this goal, I got the lead role, won't be fooled and I'm older than you're told
Girl sold, high speeds gold, game over game over too cold

Hold it down boy, your head's getting blurred
I know you can't stop thinking of her
By all means you can vibe with this girl
But just don't mug yourself, that's all don't mug yourself!

Hold it down boy, your head's getting blurred
I know you can't stop thinking of her
By all means you can vibe with this girl
But just don't mug yourself, that's all don't mug yourself!

Hold it down boy, your head's getting blurred!
I know you can't stop thinking of her!
Like girl is she as smelly ala piss!
She must have crab and fuckin' shrimp in her teeth!
