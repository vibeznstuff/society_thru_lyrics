They told me if I write this song for them.
That they would cut my hair for free.
But that's not me no liberties.

They're in to all the coolest bands
And knowing that they're going to the gigs as fans
Entitles me to some decency.

Astedwae ittlae ejaysdae
They're the cleverest blonde we ken.
Astedwae ittlae ejaysdae
I WISH everybody danced like them.

Split visions of a talkative therapy
It makes me bend away it gives me E
Seems hard to say, its insanity.

The same record for the 16th time
Exact same set you did the last time round
Doesn't bother me we're in harmony.

Astedwae ittlae ejaysdae
They're the cleverest blonde we ken.
Astedwae ittlae ejaysdae
I WISH everybody danced like them.

No low emotions rolling tonight
Young heavy hopefuls staying the night
So stick around and wait for the day.
Craziness kills laziness N happiness
Takes bad bets no one gives a fuck U see we're all out of our little heads.

Craziness kills laziness N happiness
Takes bad bets no one gives a fuck
You see we're all out of our,
All out of our,
All out of our little fucking heads

Doo doo doo doo...

Astedwae ittlae ejaysdae
They're the cleverest blonde we ken.
Astedwae ittlae ejaysdae
I WISH everybody danced like them.

Can anybody dance like them
Can U tell me
Does anybody dance like them
Can U tell me
Astedwae ittlae ejaysdae
Astedwae ittlae ejaysdae
