She wanders all alone
This is all she's ever really known
A stranger in her skin, nothing more
It's all she's ever been

She spills these words across the page
It helps to ease the pain
And she cries

"Nobody out there wants to understand
And nobody out there takes me as I am
Feeling alone here
I know there's gotta be 
Somebody somewhere..."
That's all she wrote
That's all she wrote

She always feels so small
Pushed aside, a flower on the wall
They never ask her name
No one sees the girl without a face

She spills these words across the page
It helps to ease the pain
And she cries

"Nobody out there wants to understand
And nobody out there takes me as I am
I'm feeling alone here
I know there's gotta be 
Somebody somewhere..."
That's all she wrote

Her great escape
She found her place
But she's never gonna be the same
It's beautiful 'cause now she knows...

"There's somebody out there 
Who wants to understand
There's somebody out there 
Who takes me as I am
I'm feeling at home here
I knew there had to be
Somebody somewhere..."

"There's somebody out there 
Who wants to understand
There's somebody out there 
Who takes me as I am
I'm feeling at home here
I knew there had to be 
Somebody somewhere..."

That's all the wrote
That's all she wrote, hey...
All she wrote, where all she wrote...
Hey
That's all she wrote
