You can hide around the corner
Seek me with your spies
Keep ya head a goin’
Keep ya toes on the lively side
Ooohooo

You can sleep with one eye open
Seek me from afar
I hear you got some new clothes
I even hear you gotta new car
Ooohooo

Well you can keep on laughing behind my back
‘Cause I’m waiting for the moment to strike you back
Sit around idle and nod my head
Well it’s about the patience and getting revenge
‘Cause I’m always right behind you
Always right behind you
Always right behind you
Always right behind you
Always right behind you

I heard you turned a new leaf
Gotta new set of friends, a new kind of business
You’ve even got money to spend
Ooohooo

Well it ain’t about the money
It’s all about your rotten lies
It’s all about the fact that you’re leaving me high and dry
Aaahaaa

Well you can keep on laughing behind my back
‘Cause I’m waiting for the moment to strike you back
Sit around idle and nod my head
Well it’s about the patience and getting revenge
‘Cause I’m always right behind you
Always right behind you
Always right behind you
Always right behind you
Always right behind you
