Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter, her eyes red with
The slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her.
I will call her name out loud.
I would bleed for her.
If  I could only see her now.

Living on a razor's edge.
Balancing on a ledge.
Living on a razor's edge on...
Balancing on a ledge on...
Balancing on a ledge on...
Living on a razor's edge.
Balancing on a ledge you know ... you know !!

The evil that men do lives on and on !....

Circle of fire my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me.
And I will pray for you.
...Some day I may return.
Don't you cry for me
Beyond is where I learn.

Living on a razor's edge.
Balancing on a ledge.
Living on a razor's edge you know... you know !!

The evil that men do lives on and on! 

Living on a razor's edge.
Balancing on a ledge.
Living on a razor's edge you know ... you know !!

The evil that men do lives on and on! 
The evil !
The evil !
The evil that men do...
The evil !
The evil !
The evil that men do...
Yeah yeah!!
