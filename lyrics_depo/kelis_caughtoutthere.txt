Yo, yo
Yo, this song, yo
This song is for all the women out there
That been lied to by their men
And I know you all been lied to
Over and over again
This is for y'all
Yo, maybe you didn't break the way you shoulda broke, yo
But I break, knowwhatumsaying, so
This is how it goes, yo
Psss...
Damn
Yo, yo

Last year, Valentine's day
You would spoil me and say
"Babe, I love you, love you (Yo, he's lying) and I swear"
Held you when you were sick, even ... (sucked yo dick)
The whole time I think to myself, this isn't fair

What is this I see (No)
You don't come home to me (Oh, no)
When you don't come home to me (Man)
Can't deal, can't bear

You keep tellin' me lies
But to your surprise
Look, I found her red coat
And you're (Bitch) caught out there

 - I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Ahhhhh...
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Ahhhhh...
I hate you so much right now

So sick of your games, I'll set your truck to flames
And watch it blow up, blow up, (ha-ha-ha) tell me
How you gonna see it now
So far from sincere (I love you)
Fabrications in my ear
Drive me so far up the wall
I come slidin' down

What is this I see (I don't believe this)
You don't come home to me
When you don't come home to me
I can't deal, can't bear (I won't)

You keep tellin' me lies
But to your surprise
Look, I hope you're happy
Since you're caught out there

(Yeah, you've been caught)
Yo', come on
Come on



(She's so) 
Raunchy, so vulgar, not me, why the hell her
Look, she dresses (Look at her)
A mess, what do you see (I don't know)
It's not all about cash (Hell, no)
Not how much you flash
How I dress is a reflection of me

What is this I see
You don't come home to me (Uh-uh)
When you don't come home to me
Can't deal, can't bear (Told you I won't)

You keep tellin' me lies
But to your surprise
Look, I got somethin' for y'all
Since you're caught out there
