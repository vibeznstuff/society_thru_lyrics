Farah now that we're here
Can you tell me exactly how I should have done?
Farah drives with her eyes closed
Do you ever inflict unwanted memories?
I know you and I know it won't take you long to make me smile
Farah angelic girl
I'll have you know it's you and me potentially
Farah don't pull the carpet from under me
Indifference is killing me!
Am I wry?
I know you and I know you're not afraid to say the least
Diamond ring
Diamond ring
But you can't find it
Cold is the night
