They say what the must
To gain our trust
But once the ballot's cast
They forget about us
Standing on the mountain
High above the down-trodden
They forgot about Michigan
Like all is magnificent
Sitting back watching the news
Witness the lies
They manifest
We try livin' life our best
Civil unrest buildin' up my chest
Oppressed and left the fuck back
Because we settle for less
Waiting for change to come
We get none
But a brother like me begun
To be another one
To run up in the party
And crash it
Put up a wall
We smashit

Wrecking ball to the wall, to the wall
Kings fall take 'em all, take 'em all
The killing fields pile up, pile up
Everybody stand up
Come on

It's the same old lies time after time
I can't abide don't cross these lines
You'll never read my American mind
It's the same old lies time after time

It's the same old lies time after time
They don't like my kind, I can read the signs
You'll never read my American mind
It's the same old lies time after time

New gens begin a new beginning again
Backspin rewind my timelines within
We be coming down fifty five thousand feet
Here we come, we goin' Molotov
They comin' gun
The mission, the music, the force
Free the border walls
Yes to the beat y'all
Backed by Marshall stacks
Against murder in the name of the law
Killin' in the name of the Lord
People to the power, power to the people
And the beats once again raging on the stage
Feel the burn, coming from the power six pack
Save the babies, Prophets on attack
We smashit!

Wrecking ball to the wall, to the wall
Kings fall take 'em all, take 'em all
The killing fields pile up, pile up
Mother fuckers stand up
Come on

It's the same old lies time after time
I can't abide don't cross these lines
You'll never read my American mind
It's the same old lies time after time

Yeah the same old lies time after time
They don't like my kind, I can read the signs
You'll never read my American mind
It's the same old lies time after time

Wrecking ball to the wall, to the wall
Kings fall take 'em all, take 'em all
The killing fields pile up, pile up
Mother fuckers stand up

It's the same old lies time after time
I can't abide don't cross these lines
You'll never read my American mind
It's the same old lies time after time

Yeah the same old lies time after time
They don't like my kind, I can read the signs
You'll never read my American mind
Smashit!
