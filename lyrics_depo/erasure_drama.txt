One rule for us, for you another
Do unto yourself as you see fit for your brother
Is that not within your realm of understanding?
A fifty second capacity of mind, too demanding?
Well then poor unfortunate you
There are a myriad of things that you can do
Like pick up a pen and paper (Pick up a pen or paper)
Or go talk to a friend (Go and talk to a friend)
The mystery of the future (The mystery of the future)
No violence or revenge

Your shame is never ending
Just one psychological drama after another
You are guilty and how you ever entered into this life
God only knows, the infinite complexities of love

We all have the ability
Our freedom is fragile
We all laugh and we cry don't we?
We all bleed and we smile

Your shame is never ending
Just one psychological drama after another
You are guilty (Guilty) and how you ever entered into this life
God only knows, you're not to sacrifice the art of love

Your shame is never ending
Just one psychological drama after another
We are guilty (Guilty) and how we ever entered into this life
God only knows, the infinite complexities of love

We are guilty and how you ever entered into this life
The Lord only knows, we're not to sacrifice the art of love

We are guilty and how you ever entered into this life
The Lord only knows, the infinite complexities of love

We are guilty and how you ever entered into this life
The Lord only knows, the ultimate necessity of love
