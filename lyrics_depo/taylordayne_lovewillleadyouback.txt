Saying goodbye
Is never an easy thing
But you never said that you'd stay forever
So if you must go
Well, darlin', I'll set you free
But I know in time that we'll be together

I won't try to stop you now from leaving
'Cause in my heart I know

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong

I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days our love will lead you back

One of these nights
Well I'll hear your voice again
You're gonna say, oh how much you missed me
You'll walk out this door
But someday you'll walk back in
Darling I know, I know this will be

Sometimes it takes, sometime out on your own now
To find your way back home

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong

I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days our love will lead you back, oh

I won't try to stop you now from leaving
'Cause in my heart I know, oh yeah

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong

I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days our love will lead you back, oh yeah

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
It won't be long

One of these days
Our love will lead you back
