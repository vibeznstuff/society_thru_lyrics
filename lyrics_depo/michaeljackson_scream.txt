Tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes
The lies are disgusting
So what does it mean?
Damn it

Kicking me down
I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks
Damn it


Peek in the shadow
Come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls,
But I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight


With such confusions don't it make you wanna scream?


Make you wanna scream


Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme


You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize


Somebody, please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make you just wanna scream


Tired of you tellin'
The story your way
It's causin' confusion
You think it's OK
Damn it


You keep changin' the rules
While I keep playin' the game
I can't take it much longer
I think I might go insane


With such confusion don't it make you wanna scream?


Make you wanna scream


Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme


You find your pleasure scandalizin' every lie


Oh, Father, please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop fucking with me
Make me wanna scream


"Oh, my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned on the TV this evening
I was disgusted by all the injustice, all the injustice"


"All the injustice"


"A man has been brutally beaten to death by police after being wrongly identified as a robbery suspect. The man was an 18 year old black male..."


With such collusions don't it make you wanna scream?


Make you wanna scream


Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme


You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize


Oh, brother, please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
