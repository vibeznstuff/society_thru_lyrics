Do you know the enemy
Do you know your enemy
Well gotta' know the enemy, ohaooh!

Do you know the enemy
Do you know your enemy
Well gotta' know the enemy, ohaooh!

Do you know the enemy
Do you know your enemy
Well gotta' know the enemy, ohaooh!

Violence is an energy
Against the enemy
Well violence is an energy, right.

Bringing on the fury
The choir infantry
Revolt against the honor to obey (Ohaooh)

Overthrow the effigy
The vast majority
We're burning down the foreman of control (Ohaooh)

Silence is the enemy
Against your urgency
so rally up the demons of your soul (Ohaooh)

Do you know the enemy
Do you know your enemy
well gotta know the enemy, ohaooh.

Do you know the enemy
Do you know your enemy
well gotta know the enemy, ohaooh.

Insurgency will rise,
When the blood's been sacrificed
Don't be blinded by the lies in your eyes.

Say!

Ohaooh
Ohaooh

Well, violence is an energy, ohaooh
From here to Eternity
Well, violence is an energy, ohaooh
Silence is the enemy

So give me, give me revolution!

Do you know the enemy
Do you know your enemy
Well gotta' know the enemy, ohaooh!

Do you know the enemy
Do you know your enemy
Well gotta' know the enemy, ohaooh!

Do you know the enemy
Do you know your enemy
Well gotta' know the enemy, ohaooh!

Overthrow the effigy
The vast majority
We're burning down the foreman of control

Silence is the enemy
Against your urgency
so rally up the demons of your soul (Ohaooh)
