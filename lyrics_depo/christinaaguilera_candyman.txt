Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Candyman, Candyman
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Sweet sugar candy man 

I met him out for dinner on a Friday night
He really had me working up an appetite
He had tattoos up and down his arm
There's nothing more dangerous than a boy with charm
He's a one stop shop, makes the panties drop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated candy man
A sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman

Oh yeah..

He took me to the Spider Club at Hollywood and Vine
We drank champagne and we danced all night
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise
the gossip tonight will be tomorrow's headline

He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated candy man
A sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman

Se bop bop
Hey yeah
...

He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated candy man oh
A sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman

Woo yeah

Well by now I'm getting all bothered and hot
When he kissed my mouth he really hit the spot
He had lips like sugar cane
Good things come to boys who wait

Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Candy man, candy man
Sipping from a bottle of vodka double wine
Candy man, candy man

Sweet sugar candy man 
He's a one stop, gotcha hot, making all the panties drop
Sweet sugar candy man 
He's a one stop, got me hot, making my uh pop
Sweet sugar candy man 
He's a one stop, get it while it's hot, baby don't stop
Sweet sugar 

He got those lips like sugar cane
Good things come for boys who wait

He's a one stop shop with a real big uh
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman 

Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine 
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine 
Jane lost her grip and a-down she fell 
Squared herself away as she let out a yell
