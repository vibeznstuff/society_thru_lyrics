Emergency

So come on
Give me the worst and then again
I'm feeling braver than I've ever been
From the skull down to the feet
all of the blood and sweat and meat
and for

Accident Emergency
Terrorist
Catastrophy
Dump this agony and misery
give me
Accident and Emergency

So what happnes when you lose everythin'
You just carry on and with a grin,
Sing!
For all that lovelife has to bring,
And just get yourself back into the ring,
Knock us out,
For

Accident and Emergency,
Terrorists,
Catastrophy,
From this agony and misery,
Hold on for
Accident and Emergency

'Coz if you never lose,
How you gonna know when you've won
And if it's never dark,
How you gonna know the sun,
When it shines,
Got to let it shine,

Accident and Emegency
Accident and Emegency
Accident and Emegency
Accident and Emegency
Accident and Emegency

Bring it out,
The best in me.
