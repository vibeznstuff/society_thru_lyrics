(It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do)

Yo I don't know
What you do when you do what you do boy
But baby baby baby baby

You've got me so
Caught up in ya spell, it's voodoo boy
Well baby baby baby babe

Cause every time that we rendezvous
I don't wanna go back home
And every time that I'm holding you
There ain't no way to let you go
You're shining down boy the game is through
I don't wanna play no more
Cause the only one that I want is you
So tell me what you wanna do because baby

Cause I just can't stay away
There's nothing that I can do
And baby you can have your way
Just as long as I can have you

And I'd do anything baby, do anything for ya
And I'd do anything baby, do anything for ya

Now I've been told
That you got you a few and you ain't sure
But baby baby baby baby
You gon wanna let em go
Cause I've been sold
On you, I don't check for dues no more
Cause baby baby baby baby
You the way I wanna roll

Cause every time that we rendezvous
I don't wanna go back home
And every time that I'm holding you
There ain't no way to let you go
You're shining down boy the game is through
Listen I don't wanna play no more
Cause the only one that I want is you
So tell me what you wanna do because baby

Cause I just can't stay away

And I'd do anything baby, do anything for ya

Cause I would do anything for you baby
