Sunday Shoes, Cap and Gown 
The whole town gathered around 
Waited 18 years now it's all comin down to this. 
I scanned the crowd and it fills my soul 
My best friends all here in rows 
No turning back, Now its time to walk that line 
This tassel is gonna turn 
But when the moment passes by 
We'll just walk away 
Then slowly grow apart 

But I'm not gonna cry, no 
Not one sad or happy tear 
I've waited my whole life 
Now I'm gonna fly right outta here 

It's a bittersweet goodbye, but I'm not gonna cry 

Friday night, football games, 
First loves and first heartbreaks, 
It didnt matter who won or lost, 
Only how we played, 
Memories as good as gold, 
Tearin' up those mountain roads, 
Racin' out 53, to old georgetown, 
Sure we made a little trouble, 
But learned from every mistake, 
So theres no regret, 
We've done the best we could 

So I'm not gonna cry, no 
Not one sad or happy tear 
Ive waited my whole life 
Now I'm gonna fly right outta here 

These have been the best years of my life 
So I'm not gonna cry 

Its been a lonely, winding journey 
And we've lost a few along the way 
Still we've hung in there through the tribulations 
Now its time to celebrate 
Its our graduation day 

So I'm not gonna cry 
Not one sad or happy tear 
Ive waited my whole life 
So I'm gonna fly right outta here 

This has been the best day of my life, so I'm not gonna cry 

Its a bittersweet goodbye, I'm not gonna cry
