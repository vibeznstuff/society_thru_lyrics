You shut me down, you like the control
You speak to me like I'm a child
Try to hold it down, I know the answer
I can't shake it off and you feel threatened by me

I tried to play it nice but
Oh-oh-oh, ooh, ooh
Don't kill my vibe
Oh-oh-oh, ooh, ooh
Don't break my stride

You think you're so important to me, don't you?
But I wanted you to know that you don't belong here
You think you're so important to me, don't you?
Don't kill my vibe

You love to tear me down, you pick me apart
Then build me up like I depend on you
But I throw myself from heights that used to scare me
Guess you're surprised I'm the puzzle you can't figure out

I tried to play it nice but
Oh-oh-oh, ooh, ooh
Don't kill my vibe
Oh-oh-oh, ooh, ooh
Don't break my stride
(I tried to play it nice but)

You think you're so important to me, don't you?
But I wanted you to know that you don't belong here
You think you're so important to me, don't you?
Don't kill my vibe

Say I'm young, I don't care, I won't quit, no, no, no, ho
Say I'm young, I don't care, I won't quit, no, no, no, ho
And oh-oh-oh-oh
You're acting like you hurt me but I'm not even listening
Hey, no-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're acting like you hurt me but I'm not even listening
Don't kill
Don't kill my vibe

You think you're so important to me, don't you?
But I wanted you to know that you don't belong here
You think you're so important to me, don't you?

I tried to play it nice but
Oh-oh-oh, ooh, ooh
Don't kill my vibe
Oh-oh-oh, ooh, ooh
Don't break my stride
(I tried to play it nice but)

You think you're so important to me, don't you?
But I wanted you to know that you don't belong here
You think you're so important to me, don't you?
Don't kill my vibe
