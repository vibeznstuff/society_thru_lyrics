Gym Class Heroes

Radio Killer (killer)

Hah! You know what it is.... Gym Class Heroes and Dream
It's hard to look innocent when I got cookie crumbs all over my face... Ya hear me?


I like girls, they like me
They look so good in their seven jeans
Want you to be the one and my  only
I wanna be faithful but I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar
My hands, my hands, my ha oh hands
Can't keep my hands (oh), my hands (oh), my ha oh hands (oh)
Can't keep my hands (oh), my hands (oh), my ha oh hands (oh)
Can't keep my hands (oh), my hands (oh)
My hands out the cookie jar


You see I got this problem I need help trying to solve it
Because meeting after meeting and I'm still a cookie-holic
You can hide 'Em I'm gonna find 'Em on the counter in the closet
And I'll say I ain't do it with my face covered in chocolate
My girl keeps setting boobie traps
To catch me eating scooby snacks
I left crumbs in the bed once but I told her I was through with that
She still don't be believing me but then guess that I'm cool with that
But I gotta sweet tooth
That will never come loose
And the truth of the matter is




I gotta thing for Milano, Biscotti, Italiano
And I never turn down some Oreo's if you got those
Butter Pecan, Puerto Ricans, or them Oatmeal Raisin Asians, Hazelnut Brazilians, Macedamia
Caucasians
Double stuff or thin mint
It don't matter you getting it
Cause I gotta sweet tooth
That will never come loose
And the fact of the matter is




I'm a monster for these cookies
I'm a beast for they treats
An animal for they cracker
Head to feet they so damn sweet
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha uh
My, can't keep my hands, my hands out the cookie jar
I know you had it (I'll always be)
I tried my best (always be)
I went to Cookie Anonymous (always, I'll always, I'll always be a freak)
I guess I'm a failure (I'll always be, I'll always be)
I can't seem to keep my damn hands out the cookie jar but it is what it is
(I'll always be a freak)
