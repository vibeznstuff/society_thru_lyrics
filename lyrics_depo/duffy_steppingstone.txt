I remember, way back, way back when
I said I never wanna see your face again
Cause you were loving, yes you loving somebody else
And I knew, oh, yes I knew I could control myself

And now they bring you back into my life again
And so I put on a face just like a friend
But I think you know, oh yes you know what's going on
Cause the feelings of me, oh yes of me are burning strong

But I will never be your stepping stone
Take it all or leave me alone
I will never be your stepping stone
I'm standing upright on my own

You used to call me up from time to time
And it would be so hard for me not to cross the line
The words of love lay on my lips just like a curse
And I knew, oh yes I knew it would only make it worse

And now you have the nerve to play along
Just like the maestro beats in his song
You get your kicks, you get your kicks from playing me
And the less you give, the more I want so foolishly

But I will never be your stepping stone
Take it all or leave me alone
I will never be your stepping stone
I'm standing upright on my own

No I will never be your stepping stone
Take it all or leave me alone
I will never be your stepping stone
I'm standing upright on my own

Never be your stepping stone
Take it all or leave me alone
I will never be your stepping stone
I'm standing upright on my own
