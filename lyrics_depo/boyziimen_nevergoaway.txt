Come here baby
Let me talk to you
I've been watching you
And you look so, so good tonight
Words just can't express
The way that you're makin' me feel
I'm just captured by your love
And your sensuality
Let me explain

There you are, standing there
Make me wanna reach out and touch you
And run my fingers through your hair
I know you gotta go
But I want you to stay
So we can get a little closer
And do things my way

Baby, you're so beautiful
Honey you're special too
You make me wanna do things, yeah
I never thought I'd do
Like put you up in my home
And buy you fancy things
We can make lots and lots of babies
And I'll buy you a big diamond ring, ohh

 - Never, never go
Never go away from me
Baby stay with me
Oh, never, never go
Never go away from me
Baby stay with me

Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Wanna know every single detail
Feel the movement of your skin
If you are to ever leave me
My heart would sure enough die
So please be with me forever
And don't you ever say goodbye



See you are (you are everything to me)
Can't you see baby
All of my friends think I'm crazy
Ooh, but they don't know
They don't know
A thing 'bout you and me
