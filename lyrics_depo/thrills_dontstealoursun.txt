So you've paid your dues,
(No intention to)
Those Elvis frauds, how they'll applaud,
Farewell my friends

So in your rock'n'roll
(In your rock'n'roll)
And pretty soon those pretty girls
Will find your home

We'll pay you handsomely (But you see)
Dont steal our sun
Dont steal our sun(You're just killin' fun)

I said you felt so good
(I said you felt so good)
Well I'm amazed
Hey what a show

I heard you're dating Sue (yeah your welcome to)
I'd love to talk
But don't we know
That don't ring true

We'll pay you handsomely (But you see)
Dont steal our sun
Dont steal our sun(You're just killin' fun)
