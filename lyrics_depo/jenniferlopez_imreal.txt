Called you on the phone
Said I'm coming through
Hope you're all alone
'Cause I got plans for you
We could stay at home or dance and hand all night
As long as I'm with you
It doesn't matter what we do
Don't ask me where I've been
Or what I'm gonna do
Just know that I'm here with you
Don't try to understand
Baby, there's no mystery
Cause you know how I am

I'm real, what you get is what you see
What you trying to do to me
You want to say your mine
Be with me all the time
You're falling so in love
Say you just can't get enough
You're telling all your friends

You like the way I dress
The way I wear my hair
Show me off to all your friends
Baby, I don't care
Just as long as you tell them who I am
Tell them I'm the one that made you give a damn
Don't ask where I've been
Or what I'm gonna do
Just know that I'm here with you
Don't try to understand
Baby, there's no mystery
Cause you know how I am

I'm real, what you get is what you see
What you trying to do to me
You want to say your mine
Be with me all the time
You're falling so in love
Say you just can't get enough
You're telling all your friends
