The smokestack spitting black soot into the sooty sky
The load on the road brings a tear to the indian's eye
The elephant won't forget what it's like inside his cage
The ringmaster's telecaster sings on an empty stage

Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day

The girl with the curls and the sweet pink ribbon in her hair
She's crawling out her window 'cause her daddy 
He just don't care
Come on

Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day

The clown with the frown driving down to the sidewalk fair
Finger on the trigger let me tell you gave us quite a scare

Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day

The kids flip their lids when their ids hear that crazy sound
My neighbor digs the flavor still he's moving to another town
And I don't believe he'll come back

Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day

Well i don't know how you take in all the shit you see
No don't believe anyone and most of all 
Don't believe me
Believe you

Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
