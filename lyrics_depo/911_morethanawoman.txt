Do-do-do-do 
More than a woman 
Do-do-do-do 

Oh girl I've know you very well 
I've seen you growing every day 
I never really looked before 
But now you take my breath away 
Suddenly you're in my life 
Part of everything I do 
You've got me working day and night 
Just trying to keep a hold on you 

Here in your arms I've found my paradise 
My only chance for happiness 
And if I lose you now I think I would die 
Oh say you'll always be my baby 
We can make it shine 
We can take forever 
Just a minute at a time, oh-oh 


More than a woman 
More than a woman to me, baby 
More than a woman (more than a woman) 
More than a woman to me 

Do-do-do-do 
More than a woman 
Do-do-do-do Oh girl 

There are stories old and true 
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself

(Let history repeat itself).
Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking about those people then
I know that in a thousand years
(I'd fall in love with you again).

This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love now I think I would die.

Doo doo doo doo
More than a woman
Doo doo doo doo


Oh...
(More than a woman), more than a woman
(More than a woman to me), yes you are, baby
(More than a woman), more than a woman
More than a woman to me.
(Doo doo doo doo), hooh, baby
(More than a woman)
(Doo doo doo doo), Oh... yeah, yeah, yeah
(More than a woman), more than a woman
(More than a woman to me)
(More than a woman), more than a woman
(More than a woman to me), everyday of my life
(More than a woman), oh, baby
(More than a woman to me)
(More than a woman), more than a woman
(More than a woman to me)
