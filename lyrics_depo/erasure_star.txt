We go waiting for the stars
To come showering down
From Moscow to Mars
Universe falling down

You got to look real hard
There's a fiery star
Hidden out there somewhere
Not the satellite of love
But a laser
Shooting out its shiny tongue there

God is love, God is war
T.V. preacher tell me more
Lord redeem me am I pure?
Pure as pure as heaven
Sent you money sent you flowers
Could I worship you for hours
In whose hands are we anyway?

Go waiting for the stars
To come showering down
From Moscow to Mars
Universe falling down

You got to look real hard
Is it in your heart?
Yeah it's in there somewhere
The power wrapped in your palm
Show it to me
Hit them with your wrath and thunder

What's your pleasure?
Tell it to me
How did you know?
Show your beauty
In you somewhere, somewhere in me
Pure as pure as heaven
Sent you money sent you flowers
Could I worship you for hours
In whose hands are we anyway? (Hours, hours, hours, hours)
Yee-ha

Rolling along through a rose coloured glow
The city looks pretty in pink
Armageddon is here!

Did you ever have a lover
Leave you for another
And take your love and kisses for granted
Never to discover
War is not the answer
Leave you only disenchanted

God is love, God is pure (God is love God is war God is pure as pure as heaven)
T.V. preacher tell me more
Father help me am I pure?
Pure as pure as heaven
Sent you money sent you flowers (God is love God is war God is pure as pure as heaven)
Could I worship you for hours
In whose hands are we anyway? (Hours, hours, hours, hours)

Go waiting for the stars
To come showering down
From Moscow to Mars
Universe falling down

Waiting for the stars
To come showering down
From Moscow to Mars
Universe falling down

Go waiting for the stars
To come showering down
From Moscow to Mars
Universe falling down

Go waiting for the stars
To come showering down
From Moscow to Mars
Universe falling down
