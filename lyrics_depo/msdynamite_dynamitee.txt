Yo I'm the same little girl that grew up next door to you
Went through all the things a teenage girl goes through
Hangin' out all night breakin my curfew
When my daddy hit the door I gave my mumma the blues
Use 2 spend my time blazin' lazin' days away
Thought I was grown left home at 15 didn't want to obey
Had 2 get my act together couldn't take the heat
And now I'm making beats for the streets 

I'm Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
I stay blowin' up ur stereo everybody gotta hear me though
I'm just Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
Hear me bussin' on da radio
Now feel my flow u get me though
I'm Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
See me bouncin' in da video
And I come to rock the show
I'm Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
Everybody loose control
Let my vibe touch your soul

I remeber all the house parties that took place
Bein' in my bed upstairs and we could still feel the base
And my cousins and my brothers we'd sit up all night
Listenin' to my family vibin' till the mornin' light
Remember my first years of school I was so innocent
I just wanted to learn I never been so content
But the more that I learned I found a guidin light
That showed me the need to fight
And be 

I'm Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
I stay blowin' up ur stereo
Everybody gotta hear me though
I'm just Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
Hear me bussin' on da radio
Now feel my flow u get me though
I'm Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
See me bouncin' in da video
And I come to rock the show
I'm Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
Everybody loose control
Let my vibe touch ur soul

At 13 I thought I was in love with this guy
Anytime I caught his eye I thought that I'd just die
Remember playin' class clown I was just a disruptive fool
And the beatin' I got first time suspended from school
Remember Sunday School and after go to granmas for lunch
Macaroni, rice and peas, chicken and pineapple punch
Never had much my mum brother sister and me
But love was enough to succeed
to grow 

I'm Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
I stay blowin' up ur stereo
Everybody gotta hear me though
I'm just Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
Hear me bussin' on da radio
Now feel my flow u get me though
I'm Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
See me bouncin' in da video
And I come to rock the show
I'm Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
Everybody loose control
Let my vibe touch ur soul

I'm just Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee
