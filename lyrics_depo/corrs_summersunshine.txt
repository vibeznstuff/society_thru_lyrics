Everyone's changing, I stay the same 
I'm... a solo cello outside a chor-us 
I've got a secret, 
It's time for me to tell that you've been keeping me warm 

Just sweet beginnings and bitter en-dings 
In coffee city, we borrowed hea-ven 
Don't give it back, I've never felt so wanted 
Are you taking me home? 

You tell me you have to go... 


In the heat of summer sunshine 
I miss you like nobody else 
In the heat of summer sunshine 
I kiss you, and nobody needs to know 

Now that you've left me, there's no retur-ning 
I keep comparing, you're always win-ning 
I try to be strong but you'll never be more wanted 
Will you make me at home? 

Don't tell me you have to go... 


In the heat of summer sunshine 
I miss you like nobody else 
In the heat of summer sunshine 
I kiss you, and nobody needs to know 

Ya da... ya da... ya da 

To sweet beginnings and bitter en-dings 
In coffee city, we borrowed hea-ven 
Don't give it back 
Winter is coming and I need to stay warm 

The heat..... 


In the heat of summer sunshine 
I miss you like nobody else 
In the heat of summer sunshine 
I kiss you, and nobody knows 


In the heat of summer sunshine 
I miss you like nobody else 
In the heat of summer sunshine 
I kiss you, and nobody needs to know
