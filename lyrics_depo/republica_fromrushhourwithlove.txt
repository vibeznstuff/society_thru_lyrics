No Android dreamt of Victoria or tube station allergens
Just allergic to the 20th century
But hating every morning
Shouting out but nobody hears
She said she loved someone
But it didn't begin
So each morning - I'm calling
From the rush hour with love
From the rush hour with love
From the rush hour with love
Stop sleeping, stop sleeping
I came back as an insect
But in another space and time
I could love and share and feel my feet in the sand
Stuck down the back of the Westway
Time check 8:15
He said he loved someone
But he didn't love him
So each morning - I'm calling
From the rush hour with love (get up wake up)
From the rush hour with love (gonna get gonna get gone)
From the rush hour with love (get up - stop)
Stop sleeping (sleeping) stop sleeping (sleeping)
From the rush hour with love
From the rush hour with love (gonna get gonna get gone)
From the rush hour with love (get up wake up)
(Get up)
Stop sleeping (sleeping) stop sleeping (sleeping)
