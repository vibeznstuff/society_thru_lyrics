What a night for a dance, you know I'm a dancing machine
With the fire in my bones
And the sweet taste of kerosene
I get lost in the night so high don't wanna come down
To face the loss of the good thing that I have found
Woo hoo hoooo
Woo hoo hoooo
In the dark of the night I can hear you calling my name
With the hardest of hearts, I still feel full of pain
So I drink and I smoke and I ask you if your ever around
even though it was me who drove us right into the ground
See the time we shared it was precious to me
But all the while I was dreaming of revelry
Gonna run baby run like a stream down a mountainside
With the wind in my back I wont ever even bat an eye
Just know it was you all along that had a hold of my heart
But the demon in me was a best friend from the start
So the time we shared it was precious to me
All the while I was dreaming of revelry
Dreaming of revelry
And I told myself oh the way you go it rained so hard it felt like snow
Everything came tumbling down on me
In the back of the woods, in the dark of the night
Palest pale of the old moonlight
Everythings just felt so incomplete
Dreaming of revelry
