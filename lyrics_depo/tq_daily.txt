Daily, seems like i just can’t get ahead 
As soon as i get out the bed 
It’s always something going on to drive me crazy 
I try to keep from going insane 
But i can’t help but rack my brain 
About what i'm gonna do 
This type of shit be happening daily

I water my grass 
Just to take a load off 
There’s just so much on my mind 
There goes my cell phone 
It’s always ringing 
Can’t get no time alone 
And it’s my girlfriend, trippin’ 
I don’t know what you talkin’ ‘bout 
But you making me so damn mad 
Cause you don’t have to raise your voice 
And now we arguing 
Why this always happening 
I just been busy 
I’m doing new album 
And it’s got me working


Daily, seems like i just can’t get ahead

I check my mailbox
Sony is late again (damn)
And Monday is a holiday (I can't get paid)
Look at the TV
Just lost Steve Young for two weeks
And the play offs started last week
And i put 200 on with four my homies
My rover is leaking oil in my drive way
And big daddy just cracked my rim
On the lexus as he drove away
But he got my house keys
And i just lock the door
I look to the lord above
And its startin' to rain
I swear this shit be happening

Ain’t got time for nothin’ no more
Either in the studio or on tour
Everybody gettin’ mad
Cos i don’t get back to ‘em fast enough
It’s crazy
I can’t get enough but i want some more
Cos i still ain’t got what i came here for
Until i get it
It’s a fact that I know shit don’t happen
