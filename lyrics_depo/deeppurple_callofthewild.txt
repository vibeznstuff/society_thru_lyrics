operator i'm looking for a girl
you've got to help me get through
i don't know much about her
so i'm relying on you
she got rhythm but no sense of timing
she likes living but she's got no
address
operator you've got to get me out of
this mess
let me tell you about her

she ain't got a face
she ain't got a name
she ain't got a leg to stand upon
she's out of touch
but not out of mind
and i've got to see again that gypsy
child
operator this is the call of the wild

she's a hitch hiker never gets a ride
but you can bet she's on time
she's always around but so hard to
find
she causes trouble she never takes
offence
dirty mind a heart of gold
operator don't you put me on hold
