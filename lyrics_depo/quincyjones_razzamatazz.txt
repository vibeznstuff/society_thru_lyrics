Don't believe those clouds in the sky,
Cause they'll be movin' on and the sun will shine,
If the world's been passin' you by,
Just reach for a star and you'll realize,


Got to put back all the good times that we had,
We can make it better with a little bit of Razzamatazz.

If you feel your life's in a rut,
Just come on out tonight, and we'll pull you up
Ain't no use in dragging your feet,
'Cause something's in the air that just can't be beat




Bring out the rides with all those white wall tires
Let's go out cruisin' like we used to do
Get suited down, let's set the town on fire
Jump out your seat and let the music pull you through


We can make it better with a little bit of Razzamatazz.



Repeal Bridge
You can lay your soul on the line,
'Cause we can make it work if we do it right
Got to spread this message around
The people of the world should be getting down

Repeat Chorus To Fade
