So there you are, 
Again you're circling all around, 
If you could only touch me now, 
Strangers from the past, 
Dont hesitate, 
Now we're standing face to face, 
If heaven is the only place, 
Would you take my hand? 


Just tell me what do you want from me, 
This is love in the first degree, 
Tell me why, everytime I feel your eyes all over me. 

Tell me what do you want from me, 
Are you mad enough to see, 
That its hard to cross the line, 
Come on now, set me free. 

What do you want from me. 

Get closer now, 
Softly whisper in my ear, 
Please take me away from here, 
Away from all my tears. 
Its not too late, 
Now we're standing face to face, 
And heaven is the only place, 
Will you understand? 


Just tell me what do you want from me, 
This is love in the first degree, 
Tell me why everytime I feel your eyes all over me. 

Tell me what do you want from me, 
Are you mad enough to see, 
That its hard to cross the line, 
Come on now, set me free. 

And I know, If you give me this feeling, 
I'll be there to hold you tight. 
Cauz I'd show, your love is a hero, 
We will run, run out of sight. 

What you want? 

What do you want from me, 
This is love in the first degree, 
Tell me why everytime I feel your eyes all over me
