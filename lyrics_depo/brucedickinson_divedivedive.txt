Put and opening shot. Across your bows.
Got tunnel vision. Pull the sheets in now.
Let'em flap. Let'em rip.
This man of war gonna sink your ship.
Gonna blow you midships.
Gonna dive tonight.
There's no release when your deep down inside.

Davey Jones gonna keep your bones.
No monkey buisness. Now your on your own.
Turn your stern and cover me.
We're rolling swell. Just an old sea dog like me.
Gonna blow you midships.
Gonna dive tonight.
There's no release till your deep down inside.


Dive! Dive! Dive!
Dive! Dive! Dive!
Dive! Dive! Dive!
No muff too tuff.
We dive at five.

Seamen Staines is down below.
Torpedoes loaded. He's ready to go.
Wait to discharge. Waiting to release.
I see where the bones came up from below.
Gonna blow you midships.
Gonna dive tonight.
There's no release till your deep down inside.
