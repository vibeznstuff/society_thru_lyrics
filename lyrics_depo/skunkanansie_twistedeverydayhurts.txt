I CRIED ON MY BLOOD DAY
THERE WAS NOTHING THAT I COULD HOLD ON TO 
JUST A LINE COULD HAVE HELPED
REMIND ME OF YOU, OF YOU

I SCREAMED TILL THE BLOOD CAME
I WAS LIVING IN A CLOUD OF HOPE
LOVER`S KISS,
THEN THEY MAKE A WISH TO THE END, 
THEY PRETEND

CAUSE EVERYDAY HURTS A LITTLE MORE,
AND EVERYDAY HURTS A LITTLE MORE
AND I`LL DO ANYTHING
YES I`LL DO ANYTHING
TO BELONG, TO BE STRONG
TO SAY THERE`S NOTHING WRONG

EVERYDAY HURTS A LITTLE MORE
`COS EVERYDAY HURTS A LITTLE MORE
AND I`LL DO ANYTHING 
YES I`LL DO ANYTHING
TO BELONG, TO BE STRONG
TO SAY THERE`S NOTHING WRONG

EVERYDAY HURTS

I CRIED IN THE SUNLIGHT
WOULD I FAKE ALL THE TIMES I LOVED YOU
JUST A PLAY IN A GAME
I TWISTED WITH YOU, WITH YOU
I NEED TO BELIEVE YOU
SACRIFICED ALL THE LIES WE MADE UP
HOW WE KISSED 
THEN WE MADE OUR WISH TO THE END
TO THE END



TIME MADE ME CONFIDE IN YOU
SO CONTRIVED WERE THE WORDS YOU SOLD ME
NOW NOTHING CAN SWALLOW
THE FEELING SO SHALLOW INSIDE
