Skip to the last, paragraph, just before we start,
To see the happy ending, or the broken heart.

(Naaa, nanananana) There's nothing to rely on, (Nana)
(Naaa, nanananana) C'mon and skip to the end, (Nana)

When I cut teeth, I cut to the root,
Then the end, is absolute.
When she makes sense, I go through the roof,
Then the end, has living proof.

And decide if it's worth going through with it,
Last paragraph, just before we start,
To see the happy ending, or a broken heart,
Happy ending, or a broken heart.
