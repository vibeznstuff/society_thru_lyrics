I feel so happy
Happy that I'm free
And I can see things
Things I couldn't see

I can be out every night
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
No one else holding me down
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can do just what I like
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

But I can't fall in love without you
I can't fall in love without you
I can't fall in love without you
I can't fall in love without you
Please don't fall in love without me

I hope you're sorry
Can't find the words to say
Hope you're always worried
Worrying 'bout me

Don't you think I give a fuck?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Give a fuck 'bout who you fuck?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But I hope you can get it up
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

'Cause I can't fall in love without you
I can't fall in love without you
I can't fall in love without you
I can't fall in love without you
Please don't fall in love without me

I can't fall in love without you
I can't fall in love without you
So please don't fall in love without me
