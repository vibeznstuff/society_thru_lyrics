8 o'clock, Monday night and I'm waitin' 
To finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me. 
Her name is Nona, she's a rocker with a nose ring, 
She wears a two way, but I'm not quite sure what that means. 

And when she walks, 
All the wind blows and the angels sing. 
She doesn't notice me! 

Cause she is watchin' wrestling 
Creamin' over tough guys 
Listenin' to rap metal 
Turntables in her eyes 

It's like a bad movie 
She is lookin' through me 
If you were me, then you'd be 
Screamin' "Someone shoot me!" 
As I fail miserably, 
Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want. 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 

She likes the Godsmack and I like Agent Orange 
Her cd changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad 
She says she'd like to score some reefer and a forty 
She'll never know that I'm the best that she'll never have 

And when she walks, 
All the wind blows and the angels sing. 
She'll never notice me! 

Cause she is watchin' wrestling 
Creamin' over tough guys 
Listenin' to rap metal 
Turntables in her eyes 

She likes 'em with a mustache 
Racetrack season pass 
Drivin' in a Trans-Am 
Does a mullet make a man? 

It's like a bad movie 
She is lookin' through me 
If you were me, then you'd be 
Screamin' "Someone shoot me!" 
As I fail miserably, 
Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want. 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 

There she goes again 
With fishnets on, and dreadlocks in her hair 
She broke my heart, I wanna be sedated 
All I wanted was to see her naked! 

Now I am watchin' wrestling 
Tryin' to be a tough guy 
Listenin' to rap metal 
Turntables in my eyes 
I can't grow a mustache 
And I ain't got no season pass 
All I got's a moped...moped....moped..... 

It's like a bad movie 
She is lookin' through me 
If you were me, then you'd be 
Screamin' "Someone shoot me!" 
As I fail miserably, 
Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want. 

She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
(There she goes again) 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
(There she goes again) 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want!
