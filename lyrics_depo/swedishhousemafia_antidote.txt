There’s no antidote

Don’t stop, turn that up, take it higher
Take this mother up, start a riot
Don’t stop, turn that up, take it higher
Take this mother up, start a riot
There’s a glitch inside my system
Rushing through my whole existence
Got me twisted, can’t resist this
Something’s flipping on my switches
Take ’em, break ’em, make ’em feel it
Mix it up and mass appeal it
Pressure is riding me hard
Killer dose right through my heart
And there’s no antidote
And there’s no antidote
And there’s no antidote
And there’s no antidote
There’s no antidote

There’s no antidote
