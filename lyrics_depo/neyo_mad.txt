Oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, ummm

She's staring at me, I'm sitting wondering what she's thinking
Ummm nobody's talking, 'cause talking just turns into screaming (oh,)
And now as I'm yelling over her, she yelling over me,
All that that means is neither of us are listening,
And what's even worse, that we don't even remember why we're fighting

So both of us are mad for nothing (fighting for),
Nothing (crying for),
Nothing (ooh,h)

But we won't let it go for nothing (don't let for),
Nothing.
It should be nothing
To a love like what we got oh, baby

I know sometimes it's gonna rain,
But baby can we make up now
'cause I can't sleep through the pain (can't sleep through the pain)?
Girl I don't wanna go to bed mad at you
And I don't want you to go to bed mad at me
No I don't wanna go to bed mad at you
And I don't want you to go to bed mad at me (oh, no)

Umm
And it gets me upset girl when you're constantly accusing
(asking questions like you already know)
We're fighting this war, baby, when both of us are losing
(this ain't the way that love is supposed to go. What happened to working it out?)
We fall into this place where you ain't backing down, and I ain't backing down,
So what the hell do we do now?

It's all for nothing (fighting for)
Nothing (crying for),
Nothing... (ooh,h)

We won't let it go for nothing (don't let for),
Nothing.
It should be nothing
To a love like what we got oh, baby

I know sometimes it's gonna rain (Oh, it's gonna rain),
But baby can we make up now
'cause I can't sleep through the pain (can't sleep through the pain)?
Girl I don't wanna go to bed mad at you
And I don't want you to go to bed mad at me
No I don't wanna go to bed mad at you
And I don't want you to go to bed mad at me (oh, no)

Oh, baby this love ain't gon' be perfect (perfect, perfect oh, no)
And just how good it's gonna be
We can fuss and we can fight
Long as everything is alright
Between us before we go to sleep...

Baby we're gonna be...
Happy....
Oh, ....oh,

Baby, I know sometimes it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain),
But baby can we make up now (can we make up now?)
'cause I can't sleep through the pain (can't sleep through the pain)?
Girl I don't wanna go to bed mad at you
And I don't want you to go to bed mad at me
No I don't wanna go to bed mad at you
And I don't want you to go to bed mad at me (oh, no, no, no)
