We been round, all angry and crying
Well its how much can you yell
And hey, then, while I've been outside
Well I stand and I wait and bend
Well I am never in
Well you get filled in when they sold
It took two to be right

They say we don't come any closer
It was something I want you to see
Yeah we don't come any closer
When you're weak a ya bend at the knees

They sent me out for all I could tell
They wont be there oooh aaa-at the hill
When you want me it could not have been boy
What ya want what ya cannot pretend for
They said oh I'll let em bend at a crawl around
They got my heart, they settled down
Must be the dawn, cus they barking now

They say we don't come any closer
It was something ya couldn't see
Yeah we don't come any closer
When your weak boy ya bend at the knees

Well I got pain, and I'm gonna salt it now
And with ma mouth, I've got so much I could send or 
Even fall out and then pretend
You get lonely and I gave in

They say we don't come any closer
Yeah we don't come any closer
When you're weak boy ya bend at the knees
