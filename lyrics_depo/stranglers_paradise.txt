I went in search of paradise
They said it would be good for my head
So I went in search of paradise
But she took me by the head instead

Paris - London
Glamour and despair
Ruins - We were ruined over there
Ruins - We ruined over there-er-er.

And when you think you're in paradise
But then you find your arms are tied
Caprive in the name of paradise
The chains are all her lies

Paris - London
Glamour and despair
Ruins - We were ruined over there
Ruins - We ruined over there-er-er.

The picture on the screen is moving still
It's moving all the time
If only you could freeze frame a moment there
You could have paradise all the time

Paris - London
Glamour and despair
Ruins - We were ruined over there
Ruins - We ruined over there-er-er.

I don't think anyone ever found paradise
'Cos paradise is based on lies
