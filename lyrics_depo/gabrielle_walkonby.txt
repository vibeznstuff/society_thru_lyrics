If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry, each time we meet
Walk on by
Make believe that you don't see the tears
Yes let me grieve in private
'Cos each time I see you I break down and cry
Oh walk on by
I just can't get over losing you
And if I seem broken in two
Walk on by
Foolish pride, that's all I have left
So let me hide the tears and the sadness
You gave me when you said goodbye
Oh walk on by
Stupid pride that's all I have left
So let me hide the tears and the sadness
You gave me when you said goodbye
Oh walk on by
You know you really got to go
So walk on by
Baby leave me never see the tears I cry
Know you really go to go so walk on by
