That's all I wanted:
Something special, something sacred
In your eyes.
For just one moment
To be bold and naked
At your side.

Sometimes I think that you never
Understand me (understand me).
Maybe this time is forever.
Say it can be, whoa.

That's all you wanted:
Something special, someone sacred
In your life.
Just for one moment
To be warm and naked
At my side.

Sometimes I think that you never
Understand me (understand me).
But something tells me together
We'd be happy, oh, oh.

(baby)
I will be your father figure.
(oh, baby)
Put your tiny hand in mine.
(I'd love to)
I will be your preacher teacher.
(be your daddy)
Anything you have in mind.
(it would make me)
I will be your father figure.
(very happy)
I have had enough of crime.
(please let me)
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time (of time).

That's all I wanted,
But sometimes love can be mistaken
For a crime.
That's all I wanted:
Just to see my baby's
Blue eyes shine.

This time I think that my lover
Understands me (understands me).
Please
If we have faith in each other
Then we can be
Strong.

(baby)
I will be your father figure.
Put your tiny hand in mine.
(my baby)
I will be your preacher teacher.
Anything you have in mind.
I will be your father figure.
I have had enough of crime.
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time.

If you are the desert
I'll be the sea.
If you ever hunger 
Hunger for me.
Whatever you ask for
That's what I'll be.

So when you remember the ones who have lied,
Who said that they cared,
But then laughed as you cried,
Beautiful darling,
Don't think of me.

Because all I ever wanted...
It's in your eyes, baby, baby.
And love can't lie.
No.

Greet me with the eyes of a child.
My love is always tellin' me so.
Heaven is a kiss and a smile.
Just hold on, hold on.
And I won't let you go, my baby.

I will be your father figure.
Put your tiny hand in mine.
I will be your preacher teacher.
Anything you have in mind, baby.
I will be your father figure.
And I have had enough of crime.
I will be the one who loves you—
So, I am gonna love you—
'Til the end of time.

I will be your father.
(I will be your...)
I will be your preacher.
(...father)
I will be your father.
I'll be your daddy, whoa.
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time.
