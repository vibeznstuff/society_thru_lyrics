I never understood before.
I never knew what love was for.
My heart was broke, my head was sore -
What a feeling.

Tied up in ancient history,
I didn't believe in destiny.
I look up, you're standing next to me -
What a feeling.

What a feeling in my soul -
Love burns brighter than sunshine,
Brighter than sunshine.
Let the rain fall, I don't care.
I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine.
Suddenly, you're mine;
And it's brighter than sunshine.

I never saw it happening.
I'd given up and given in.
I just couldn't take the hurt again -
What a feeling.

I didn't have the strength to fight.
Suddenly, you seemed so right.
Me and you -
What a feeling.

What a feeling in my soul -
Love burns brighter than sunshine.
It's brighter than sunshine.
Let the rain fall, I don't care.
I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine.
Suddenly, you're mine.

And it's brighter than the sun.
It's brighter than the sun.
It's brighter than the sun, sunshine.

Love will remain a mystery,
But give me your hand, and you will see.
Your heart is keeping time with me.

What a feeling in my soul -
Love burns brighter than sunshine.
It's brighter than sunshine.
Let the rain fall, I don't care.
I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine.
Suddenly, you're mine.

I got a feeling in my soul.
Love burns brighter than sunshine,
Brighter than sunshine.
Let the rain fall, I don't care.
I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine.
Suddenly, you're mine.

I got a feeling in my soul.
Love burns brighter than sunshine.
It's brighter than sunshine.
Let the rain fall, I don't care.
I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine.
Suddenly, you're mine.
And it's brighter than sunshine.
