Here we are
Painting pictures of a war
Maybe I don't get it all
So here we are again
So cold
Maybe there's another way
Maybe words don't have to play another part

Tell me what I could have done
Looking back I tried my best to carry on
But the feeling we once had
Starts to fade beneath the bad
And it's everything, it's everything

And I'm losing you
Yeah, I'm losing you
And I'm almost at the point of giving it up, oh no
Yeah, I'm losing you
And I'm losing you
But I don't think you can see there's no other love

Here I am
Staring back at what we were
Just remember it was her
That made me
Now I'm crawling
To stop from falling
Will I ever understand?
You're what I want

And tell me what I could have done
Looking back I tried my best to carry on
But the feeling we once had
Starts to fade beneath the bad
And it's everything, it's everything

And I'm losing you
Yeah, I'm losing you
And I'm almost at the point of giving it up, oh no
Yeah, I'm losing you
And I'm losing you
But I don't think you can see there's no other love

Mmm
And you say
That it's hard
But you walk away again
And you say
That it's hard
You still walk away
In the end

Yeah, I'm losing you
Yeah, I'm losing you
I'm losing you, ooh
