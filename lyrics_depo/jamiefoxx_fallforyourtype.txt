Can I, can I save you from you
cause you know there’s something missing
and that champagne you’ve been sippin’s
not supposed to make you different all the time
it’s starting to feel like the wrong thing to do girl
cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
to the things that I must say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we’ll be fine
trying to convince myself I’ve found one
making the mistake I never learned from

I swear I always fall for your type, yeah (for your type)
tell me why I always fall for your type (for your type)

I just can’t explain this shit at all (fall for your type)
I just can’t explain this shit at all (fall for your type)

(I believe in people like you)


So who am I to judge you on the past, girl
I bet there’s a reason for it all
you say that you’re nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don’t let me down right now
it’s too late, I’m already yours
you just gotta promise me, hearts won’t break
and end up like before

I swear I always fall for your type, yeah (for your type)
tell me why I always fall for your type (for your type)


Look, dress hanging off your shoulder, barely sober
telling me how you moving away and starting over
girl, quit playing you just drunk, you just saying shit
oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and shit
oh, wait, no, I get it girl, I’m with it
I’ve been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
damn, yeah, I wonder why I never learned my lesson
it’s feeling like the second chance and it's the first impression
and I heard it’s nothing new except for someone new
but how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
talking to myself but I never listen,
cuz man it’s been a while, and I swear that this ones different
that’s why I’mma take you anywhere you wanna go
let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about
how reckless I have been
and I’m slowly running out of all the time that I invest in
making all the same mistakes
and I’m just trying to correct it and I fall...


I swear I always fall for your type, for your type
tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type

I just can’t explain this shit at all (fall for your type)
I just can’t explain this shit at all (fall for your type)

(I believe in people like you)
