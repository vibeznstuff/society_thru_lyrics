The one good thing in my life
Has gone away, I don't know why
She's gone away, I don't know where
Somewhere I can't follow her

The one good thing didn't stay too long (woo, who, who, who)
My back was turned and she was gone

Good thing, where have you gone
(Doo, doo, doobie doo)
My good thing, you've been gone too long
(Good thing, doo, doo, doobie doo)

People say I should forget
New friend tomorrow, don't get upset
People say she's doing fine
Mutual friends I see sometime

That's not what I want to hear (woo, who, who, who)
I want to hear she wants me near

Good thing, where have you gone
(Doo, doo, doobie doo)
My good thing, you've been gone too long
(Good thing, doo, doo, doobie doo, good thing)

Then one day she came back
I was so happy that I didn't ask
Morning came into my room (woo, who, who, who)
Caught me dreaming like a fool

Good thing, ah, ah, ah, my good thing
(Doo, doo, doobie doo, good thing)
My, my, my, my, good thing
Where have you gone
(Good thing, doo, doo, doobie doo, good thing)
My good thing, mm, hmm, my good thing
(Doo, doo, doobie doo, good thing)
Girl, where have you gone
(Good thing, doo, doo, doobie doo, good thing)

It's been so long
Good God, girl
(Doo, doo, doobie doo, good thing)
Good God, girl
Good God, girl
(Good thing, doo, doo, doobie doo, good thing)
Good God
(Doo, doo, doobie doo, good thing)
Good God
