Look in the mirror time to face up
Ever tried to live without the photographs and money
Don't have to live behind the make-up
Cos all I want is what's itching inside of u 

Cos I saw you sitting in the rain with the tears running down, running down your face
It makes me shiver when I see u like this
But just open u'r eyes and watch it fade away
Cos I saw you sitting in the rain with the tears running down, running down your face
Can't u see it's a masquerade so get u'rself together

Plug it in plug it in baby
Where u been, where u been baby
Plug it in plug it in baby
Where u been, where u been baby

I wouldn't say that its so serious
I know u think u'r in a tragic condition
U know that I'm a little bit more than curious
When all I want is what's kicking inside of you

Cos I saw you sitting in the rain with the tears running down, running down your face
It makes me shiver when I see u like this
But just open u'r eyes and watch it fade away
Cos I saw you sitting in the rain with the tears running down, running down your face
Can't u see it's a masquerade so get u'rself together

Plug it In plug it in baby
Where u been, where u been baby
Plug it in plug it in baby
Where u been, where u been baby

Ever tried to live without the makeup

Plug it in, plug it in baby...
