Oh, you've got the feeling that I wanna feel
Oh, you've got the feeling that I know is real, real, real

It's in the way you look, it's in the way you love
And I can see that this is real
It's in the way you talk, it's in the way you touch
And I can see

This is real, real, real, real love
This is real, real, real, real love
You give me that feeling, you give me that feeling
You give me that, you give me real love
You give me that feeling, you give me that feeling
You give me that, you give me real love

Oh, before you I was searching for a rarity
Oh, you showed me things I'd never thought that I would see

It's in the way you look, it's in the way you love
And I can see that this is real
It's in the way you talk, it's in the way you touch
And I can see

This is real, real, real, real love
This is real, real, real, real love
You give me that feeling, you give me that feeling
You give me that, you give me real love
You give me that feeling, you give me that feeling
You give me that, you give me real love

Time won't waste, and we just learn
To take it slow and wait our turn
Held my breath, cause I believed
That you'll find me

Real, real, real, real love
This is real, real, real, real love
You give me that love (Real love)
You give me that love (Real love)
You give me that love (Real love)
You give me that love

This is real, real, real, real love
This is real, real, real, real love

You give me that feeling, you give me that feeling
You give me that, you give me real love
You give me that feeling, you give me that feeling
You give me that, you give me real love
You give me that love (Real love)
You give me that love (Real love)
You give me that love (Real love)
You give me that love

You give me that love (Real love)
You give me that love (Real love)
You give me that love (Real love)
You give me that love, real love
