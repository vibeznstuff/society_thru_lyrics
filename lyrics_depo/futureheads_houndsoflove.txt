When I was a child, running in the night, i was afraid of what might be
Hiding in the dark and hiding on the street, and of what was following me

The hounds of love are calling
I've always been a coward, and I don't know what's good for me

Well here I go,it's coming at me through the trees
Help me, someone, help me, please
Take my shoes off, and i will throw them in the lake, and I will be, two steps on the water

I found a fox, who was caught by dogs, he let me take him in my hands
His little heart, it beat so fast
And I'm ashamed to be running away
From nothing real, i just can't deal with this
I feel ashamed to be there

Among your hounds of loving
And feel your arms surround me
I've always been a coward, and i dont know what's good for me

Oh, here I go, don't let me go, hold me down
It's coming at me through the trees
Help me, someone, help me, please
Take my shoes off, and i will throw them in the lake, and I will be, two steps on the water
And I will be, two steps on the water

Do you know what I need, do you know what I need, i need love love love love love, yeah
Take your shoes off, and throw them in the lake, and I will be, two steps on the water
Do you know what I need, do you know what I need, i need love love love love love, yeah
Do you know what I need, do you know what I need, i need love love love love love, yeah
