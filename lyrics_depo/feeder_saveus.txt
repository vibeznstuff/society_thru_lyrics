Face against the ground
Torn, but you can stand
Your will is strong, but you have now
I know you can save us

Faith is on your side
Fears you can't deny
It's burned a hole, right through your soul
But I know you can save us
Save us now

Don't say goodbye
I know you can save us
Don't wave goodbye
But nothing can break us
Don't say goodbye
I know you can save us
You can bring us back again

Born to be as one
Turn to face the sun
Your will is strong, but you have now
I know you can save us
Save us now

Don't say goodbye
I know you can save us
Don't wave goodbye
But nothing can break us
Don't say goodbye
I know you can save us
You can bring us back again
You can bring us back again

Face against the ground
Torn, but you can stand
Your will is strong, but you have now
I know you can save us

Don't say goodbye
I know you can save us
Don't wave goodbye
But nothing can break us
Don't say goodbye
I know you can save us
You can bring us back again

Don't say goodbye
I know you can save us
Don't wave goodbye
But nothing can break us
Don't say goodbye
I know you can save us
You can bring us back again
You can bring us back again
