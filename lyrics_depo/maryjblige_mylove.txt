Ohhhh, oh oh oh oh
Baby
Whatcha gonna do
Baby
My, my, my love


I was a fool to let you in
Knowing you would play with my heart
But that was so long ago that I
Thought we could make a new start
You left me broken hearted
From the day your love departed
Now that love you found with someone new is gone
And so you wanna come back


Whatcha gonna do without my love
My love
Whatcha gonna do without my love

Whatcha gonna do without my love
My love
Whatcha gonna do
Now that my love has gone away from you


Sweet memories of yesterday
When it all seemed so right
I was loving you, kissing you, holding you tight
I wish you know that a woman
That you learn to leave today
And it's a shame that you wanna come back now baby
My love has gone away





I played the fool for you baby
And you stole away my heart
(Whatcha gonna do)
Now that my love is gone away
(Whatcha gonna do)
Sweet memories of yesterday
(Whatcha gonna do)
Now that my love is gone away
