Let's face the facts you ain't coming back, like a train down a track.
So much I'd change even your last name but it's way too late for that.
While I'm sinking low you're taking the high road.

Hope you get what you deserve.
And now our past like mental photographs I picture you with me.
As I lie awake in the bed I've made while you're fast asleep.
It's a lesson that I've learned and a peace of mind you've earned.

Hope you get what you deserve.
What goes and comes around.
Sure you've got it coming back to you.
Cause karma has a funny way of settling all the things we do
and girl right now you know I hurt but baby for what it's worth, hope you get what you deserve.

There's a world out there it ain't all unfair full of beautiful things.
And big or small hope you catch them all while you're chasing your new dreams.
With the hell you've endured go find heaven on earth.

Hope you get what you deserve.
What goes and comes around.
Sure you've got it coming back to you.
Cause karma has a funny way of settling all the things we do
and girl right now you know I hurt but baby for what it's worth, hope you get what you deserve.

Since you left me behind Lord knows I got mine.
Hope you get what you deserve.
Hope you get what you deserve.
