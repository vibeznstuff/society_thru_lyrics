I've come a long way
From a very hard place
It's been a hard race
But somehow I found my way home
I've walked a long road
To where only God knows
But when the trumpet blows you know
I did it all on my own

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ohhhhhh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ohhhhhh


I've been pushing hard
I've been praying harder
Only Heaven can help me
They took my earthly father
Martyred and promised me death then walked me into my grave
I'd rather die a free man then live on Earth a slave
I'm fighting for people they put in chains
They stripped our heritage, they took our names
Put our women to shame
Whipped us and beat us, mislead us but they can't take our passion
Take my body but my soul won't fit inside your casket


Forget what I said, forget what I did
I did what I had to do and I'd do it all again
And if you're going through hell
Keep it going, my baby promise that Heaven is near

I've come a long way
From a very hard place
It's been a hard race
But somehow I found my way home
I've walked a long road
To where only God knows
But when the trumpet blows you know
I did it all on my own

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ohhhhhh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ohhhhhh


Taken from Africa
Treated like animals
Culturally denigrated
Broke up our families
Prison of false religion, the same God you lied on
The same God I rely on, I'm a strive on
Alone just a small tribe
Fought for truth for y'all, died
Martyrs live forever so
Out the depths we all rise
Die for a freedom that I'll never see
I pray y'all live it to the fullest for my legacy
Let's go


Forget what I said, forget what I did
I did what I had to do and I'd do it all again
And if you're going through hell
Keep it going, my baby promise that Heaven is near

I've come a long way
From a very hard place
It's been a hard race
But somehow I found my way home
I've walked a long road
To where only God knows
But when the trumpet blows you know
I did it all on my own

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ohhhhhh
I did it all on my own
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ohhhhhh
I did it all on my own
