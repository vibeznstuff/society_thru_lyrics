Oh maybe I think, maybe I don’t
Maybe I will, maybe I won’t 
Find my way this time
I hear you calling me soon

One of these days 
Somebody stays and somebody pays
It happens all the time
I’ll be leaving, believing you wanted me to

Maybe I’m a fool
For walking in line
Maybe I should try to lead this time
I’m an honest mistake that you make
Did you mean to?
Did you mean
Did you mean 

Love is just a game
Broken all the same
And I will get over you
Love is just a lie
Happens all the time
Swear I know this much is true

And they collared you up
And collared you down
And coloured you in
And I’ve been waiting so long
To take you home

And maybe I think, maybe I don’t
Maybe I will, maybe I won’t
Find my way tonight
But I hear you calling me soon

Maybe I’m a fool
For walking in line
Maybe I should try to lead this time
I’m an honest mistake that you make
Did you mean to?
Did you mean
Did you mean 

Love is just a game
Broken all the same
And I will get over you
Love is just a lie
Happens all the time
Swear I know this much is true

Maybe I’m a fool
For walking in line
Maybe I should try to lead this time
I’m an honest mistake that you made
Did you mean to?
Did you mean
Did you mean 

Love is just a game
Broken all the same
And I will get over you
Love is just a lie
Happens all the time
Swear I know this much is true
