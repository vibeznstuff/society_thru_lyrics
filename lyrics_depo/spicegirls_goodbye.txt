Listen little child there will come a day 
when you will be able, able to say, nevermind the pain, 
all the aggrevation, you know there's a better way 
for you and me to be 
Look for the rainbow in every storm, 
Fly like an angel heaven sent to me 
Goodbye my friend, 
(I know your going searching although I can still feel ya here) 
It's not the end, 
(You gotta keep it strong before the pains turn into fears) 
So glad we made it, time will never change it no no no

Just a little love, 
Big imagination, 
Never let no one take it away, 
Went into the world

What a revelation, 
She found there's a better way for you and me to be 
Look for the rainbow in every storm, 
Find out for certain 
love is gonna be there for you, 
You'll always be someone's baby
