I don't even need to go to the club no more
I just need you here with me on this floor
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing at all
Just take a chance, grab my hand, now let's dance

I can feel it in my heart when I'm close to you
We ain't really got nothing here to lose
I just wanna bounce, baby, bounce, bounce, bounce
'Cause you know this right here is what I'm talking about
Talking about, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Talking about, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

We've been in this for some time
You're the type of girl that's always there to hold me down
When it comes to love you give it all
'Cause with you it's like I got a friend come rise or fall 
It's why we flow like melodies
Who needs words, not us, cause we be in L-O-V-E
Like a beautiful harmony
Fit together so perfectly

I don't even need to go to the club no more
I just need you here with me on this floor
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing at all
Just take a chance, grab my hand, now let's dance

I can feel it in my heart when I'm close to you
We ain't really got nothing here to lose
I just wanna bounce, baby, bounce, bounce, bounce
'Cause you know this right here is what I'm talking about
I'm talking about, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
That's what I'm talking about, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
That's what I'm talking about, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
That's what I'm talking about, yeah yeah, yeah yeah

I don't even need to go to the club no more
I just need you here with me on this floor
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing at all
Just take a chance, grab my hand, now let's dance

I can feel it in my heart when I'm close to you
We ain't really got nothing here to lose
I just wanna bounce, baby, bounce, bounce, bounce
'Cause you know this right here is what I'm talking about
Talking about, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Talking about, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, that's what I'm talking about 
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, that's what I'm talking about
