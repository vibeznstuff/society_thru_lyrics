Hey, mamacita
Come, let's stay 'til ma単ana

Keep it a hundred in the fast lane, so high
Like Amber Rose without the foreplay, four fives
We gettin' money, baby, no shame, hold tight
You take a selfie, girl, you're so vein, don't lie
You know I love it, baby, no way, oh my
You know I like the way you rotate, close thighs
Coco Cubano in your Dolce, all lies
It's not my lady, but it's okay, I know why
You're super wavy, baby
Baby, you're my cup of tea
And I really wanna be in your company
Any good thing comin' is gon' come to me
When I pop, pop in your dungarees
And again, 20 and 0, undefeated
The batty so big, my squad don't believe it
And haters gonna diss like Drizzy, like Chris like
Trippin', this is it life, now I'm singin' this like


Oh, mamacita

Hey, mamacita

We grew up learning things the hard way, close ties
You only make it if you grow free, don't die
Remember startin' up my own wave, won't lie
I used to bus it, baby, no train, no sky
Now when you bus it baby throw shade on those guys
You know I liked you back in '08, '09
You used to call me on my house phone, late night
My mum complainin' but it's okay, it's your time
Protecfully, my baby
Baby, you're my cup of tea
And I really wanna be in your company
Cause the whole industry is tryna come for me
Dirty pictures on the 'Gram, save some for me
Hotter than 81 degrees
Yeah, none of them girls got nothin' on your steez
Yeah and haters gettin' dissed like smiley with a kiss like
Scrollin' through your pics like, got me singin' this like


Oh, mamacita

When you come through, you make me feel nice
Yeah she shines so bright like the daylight
When she come it don't stop like a red light
Yeah, yeah mamacita!
Yeah you give me some
Any way you want, any way you like
Ready when you're ready, got the Remy on the side
Say she goin' in, say she wanna vibe
Yeah, yeah mamacita!


Oh, mamacita

Girl I wanna meet you in my next life
My girl, in the dark you're my sunlight
For you, I don't want the street life
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah mamacita!
With you I wanna live a good life
If we have kids, what would it be like?
But tonight let's live on and enjoy life
Cause I'm on the road my whole life
Mamacita!

Love me, lady, yeah, oh I
Love me, lady, yeah, oh I
