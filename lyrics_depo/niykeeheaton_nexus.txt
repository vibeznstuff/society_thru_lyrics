Au-automatic weapon
A criminal appetite for affection
I romanticize murder, know you sweating
And I think I got a thing for a felon
Sounds like heaven, what's the consensus?
Bring that girl over here, now the next chick
Now she all up in my ear but where her friend is?
Now they both hanging on me like a necklace
I'm ambidextrous

I don't wanna talk like a boss
But we both know you know who I am
And I know that the way it comes off
Might seem a little bit off hand
I don't wanna talk like a boss
But we both know you know who I am
And I know that the way it comes off
Might seem a little bit off hand

Now you're looking at the Nexus
Nothing better than the best, I'm the bestest
Look to your right, now your left, no precious
Yeah, I whip it so wild cause I'm reckless
I'm the, I'm the motherfucking Nexus
Nothing better than the best, I'm the bestest
Look to your right, now your left, no precious
Yeah, I whip it so wild cause I'm reckless
I'm the, I'm the, I'm the Nexus

Cynical about reality
Lyrical with criminal versatility
Out of principal, got minimal morality
I'll take your chick, just like it's a formality
Now you're mad at me

I don't wanna talk like a boss
But we both know you know who I am
And I know that the way it comes off
Might seem a little bit off hand
I don't wanna talk like a boss
But we both know you know who I am
And I know that the way it comes off
Might seem a little bit off hand

Now you're looking at the Nexus
Nothing better than the best, I'm the bestest
Look to your right, now your left, no precious
Yeah, I whip it so wild cause I'm reckless
I'm the, I'm the motherfucking Nexus
Nothing better than the best, I'm the bestest
Look to your right, now your left, no precious
Yeah, I whip it so wild cause I'm reckless
I'm the, I'm the, I'm the Nexus

Better than expected
Ultimately unaffected
I'm not worried 'bout the next bitch
Cause I'm the next bitch
Better than expected
Ultimately unaffected
I'm not worried 'bout the next bitch
Cause I'm the next bitch
And the next and the next bitch

I'm the Nexus
Nothing better than the best, I'm the bestest
Look to your right, now your left, no precious
Yeah, I whip it so wild cause I'm reckless
I'm the, I'm the motherfucking Nexus
Nothing better than the best, I'm the bestest
Look to your right, now your left, no precious
Yeah, I whip it so wild cause I'm reckless
I'm the, I'm the, I'm the Nexus
