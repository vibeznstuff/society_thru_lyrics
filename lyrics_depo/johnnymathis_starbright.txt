Starbright, I have made a wish upon you.
Now my heart is counting on you.
Wont you grant my wish tonight.

Starbright, wont you glow with all your splendor.
Wont you make her heart surrender.
Wont you make her mine tonight.

Help me. Help me make her heart discover
Just how much I really love her.
Help me make her mine tonight.

Oh, oh, oh, oh starbright. since you know how much I need her.
Can't you spare some light to lead her to my empty arms tonight.

Oh, oh, oh, oh starbright. since you know how much I need her.
Can't you spare some light to lead her to my empty arms tonight.

Oh starbright.
