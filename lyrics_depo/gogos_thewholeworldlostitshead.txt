Freeway fell into the bay
Popes on L.S.D.
Muslim girls are getting down
In bikinis
Nazis selling tupperware
Door to door
Telepreachers mud-wrestling
On the dance floor

I read it in the paper
I see it on my TV
Has the whole world lost its head
(Is it just me)
Has the whole world lost its head
(Is it just me)
Has the whole world lost its head

You can buy tomatoes
That last 500 years
Claudia Schiffer's fianc?Â³
Made her disappear
Drag queens have the navy
Tossing in their beds
Mary ate her little lamb
And punk rock isn't dead

I read it in the paper
I see it on my TV
Has the whole world lost its head
(Is it just me)
Has the whole world lost its head
(Is it just me)
Has the whole world lost its head

I read it in the paper
I see it on my TV
Has the whole world lost its head
(Is it just me)
Has the whole world lost its head
(Is it just me)
Has the whole world lost its head
(Is it just me)
Has the whole world lost its head
Lost its head
Lost its head
Lost its head
