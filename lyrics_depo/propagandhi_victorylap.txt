When the flames engulfed the home of the brave,
The stampede toward the border was in vain.
Faces palmed, faces paled
As the wall they said would make them great could not be scaled.
When the free-market fundamentalist steps
On a roadside bomb outside Kandahar bleeding to death,
I swear to Ayn Rand
I'll ask if he needs an invisible hand.

You say not all cops. You say not all men.
Yeah you insist it's only 99%.
There's nothing new for you to learn.
Ok, sit back, relax and watch it all burn.
The colossal waste of energy:
Talent upon the talented, freedom upon the free.
This whole damn beautiful life
Wasted on you and me.

God are you there?
It's me, in the denim jacket.
Are you receiving my prayers through the noise and cosmic static?
God are you there?
Can you confirm I'm on the right goddamn planet?!

The day the rapture came, a forgettable event.
The clouds, they opened up and not a single person went.
To the chromatic whistle of a carousel calliope
Stomp the citizens of our clown idiot dingbat society.

Stomp
