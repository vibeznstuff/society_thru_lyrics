In this madness, in this world,
With it's swiftness and it's cold
You're my peace of mind, yes!
When the world just keeps turning
And you know where to head to
You're peace of mind!
And when I look up in the skies
Is the one that you created
Nothing melt the stars if only you created it


Oh shining star, please don't look down on me!
Oh, what you are?
When you look down on me
Beautiful star, do keep your eyes on me!
Oh, oh, what you are
When you look down on me?

As if I greed you and you just be with your heart strict I appreciate you baby 
And although it seems so far away
You pursuit me I can feel you
Love it within my mind
And I know you're sometimes lonely
Oh, I wish that I could change it,
Oh then I know you still got me
And I pray my love will give you life
To wrap you and to keep you smile
You're my shining star, to take my love and live!


Oh shining star, please look down for me!
Oh, what you are?
When you look down at me
When you and I feel love
When you blaze your light on me I feel warmer

Where you smile I smile,
Where you live I live,
Where you die, I die!
Oh, yeah! You!
I'm a shining star, oh I wonder what you are?
