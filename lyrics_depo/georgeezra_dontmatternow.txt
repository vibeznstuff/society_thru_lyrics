Sometimes you need to be alone
It don't matter now
Shut the door, unplug the phone
It don't matter now
Speak in a language they don't know
It don't matter now

Well I don't think about that stuff
No, I don't think about that stuff
It don't matter now

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo

Build a castle out of sand
It don't matter now
Where it won't last and it won't stand
It don't matter now
With a suitcase in your hand
It don't matter now

Well I don't think about that stuff
No, I don't think about that stuff
It don't matter now

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo

Batman running your hometown
Serve you well, run through the crowd
It don't matter now
Change your name, you won't be found
It don't matter now

Well I don't think about that stuff
No, I don't think about that stuff
It don't matter now

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
It don't matter now
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
It don't matter now
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
It don't matter now
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
No, it don't matter now
