An aggressive nature does not make the weaker man a gladiator
Inside this misty circle

Well, here's looking at you
And all your schemes are undone
And you just can't pull my ideas down
Well take a good look within
And this is no place for me, 
Oh, I just can't pull my ideas down!

They won't come down...

Look at this mess we're in
Oh Lord, I do declare
I've got rusted guitar strings, man
They're wound around my hair
And lately these days
I'm in so many empty spaces
I'm transfixed I see these ugly faces
That pull me down...

Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
My heads in the clouds, yeah I get misty
Just holding your hand

What can you do when you don't seem to fit
You fall to bits inside all because of it
Blame it on some massive lack of confidence.

3 years from now, where will I be?
Who will behind me pulling me down?

Well I'm curious about how I got to be wrapped around
The lines on someone's hand.
Won't you tell me realistically
How long can I expect to be inside this misty circle?
