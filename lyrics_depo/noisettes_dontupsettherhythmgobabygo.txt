Don't Upset The Rhythm, no
Don't Upset The Rhythm
The time is right
The sun is sleeping in the sky
Free your mind
You never know what you might find
What's your vice
You know we won't compromise
So let me show you
Something simple beautiful

Let's rock the boat
The magic is unstoppable
For on floor
It's the rhythm you've been waiting for
Pure delight, kicks, snare, hat, ride

It's all up to you and whatever you do
Don't cut into my action
4-3-2-1
Go baby, go baby GO!
Don't Upset The Rhythm, no
Go baby, go baby GO!
Don't Upset The Rhythm
Go baby, go baby GO!
Don't Upset The Rhythm, don't you dare
Go baby, go baby GO!

Skin and bones
Acrobats and microphone
Can't get home
You can use my dog bone
Well crank the stereo even when the speaker low
D-I-Y
Just met at the paradise

Whatever it takes, to carry you away
It all comes down to actions
4-3-2-1
Go baby, go baby GO!
Don't Upset The Rhythm, no
Go baby, go baby GO!
Don't Upset The Rhythm
Go baby, go baby GO!
Don't Upset The Rhythm, don't you dare
Go baby, go baby GO!

Go baby, go baby GO!
(Come on)
Go baby, go baby GO!
(This time I like it)
Go baby, go baby GO!
Now don't you dare
Don't Upset The Rhythm

Don't Upset The Rhythm no
(Go, go, go)
Don't Upset The Rhythm
(Go, go, go)
Don't Upset The Rhythm, don't you dare
I told you Don't Upset The Rhythm!

Go baby, go baby GO!
Don't Upset The Rhythm, no
Go baby, go baby GO!
Don't Upset The Rhythm
Go baby, go baby GO!
Don't Upset The Rhythm, don't you dare
Go baby, go baby GO!
Don't Upset The Rhythm
