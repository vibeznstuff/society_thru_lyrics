When am I gonna make a living
Ooh it's gonna take a while before I give in
See the people fussing and thieving
While is sharks are wheeling and dealing 
Got to wake up and tell yourself
There's no end to what you can do
They'll waste your body and soul
If you allow them to 

This is the time
To start believing in yourself
Put the blame on no one else 

When am I gonna make a living
Ooh it's gonna take a while before I give in
See the people fussing and stealing
Too many lies no one is achieving 

Haven't I told you, before
We're hungry for a life we can't aford
There's no end to what you can do
If you give yourself a chance ,to prove 

We're hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
We're Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in 

Ooh there's no end to what we can do
They'll waste your body and soul if you allow them to
Ooh start believing in yourself
Put the blame on no one else 

When am I gonna make a living
Ooh it's gonna take a while before I give in
I'm sick and tired of scratching a living
I'm hungry but I'm not gonna give in 

Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we're gonna win
