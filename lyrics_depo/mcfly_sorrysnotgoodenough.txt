Good, good, good, good enough.
Good, good, good enough.
Good, good, good enough.
Good, good

I can't stop, I can't stop loving you.
You're a dreamer and dreaming's what you do,
I won't stop believing that this is the end, there must be another way.
Cos I couldn't handle the thought of you going away, woah yeah.

Sorry's not good enough, why are we breaking up?
Cos I didn't treat you rough so please don't go changing.
What was I thinking of?
You said you're out of love, baby don't call this off because sorry's not good enough.

Don't stop, all those things you do.
I'm a believer and that's what gets you through,
I can't fight this feeling that this is the end,
We're in the thick of it, where will this ever end? Woah, woah.

Sorry's not good enough, why are we breaking up?
Cos I didn't treat you rough so please don't go changing.
What was I thinking of?
You said you're out of love, baby don't call this off because sorry's not good enough.

Oh, you said you'd never leave me be there, to hold and please me.
Sorry's just not good enough for you,
Everybody makes mistakes and that's just what we do.

Good, good, good, good enough.
Good, good, good enough.
Good, good, good enough.
Good, good.

Don't go changing, 
Don't go changing (sorry's not good enough),
Don't go changing (sorry's not good enough),
Don't go changing (sorry's not good enough),
Don't go changing.

Sorry's not good enough, why are we breaking up?
Cos I didn't treat you rough so please don't go changing.
What was I thinking of?
You said you're out of love, baby don't call this off because sorry's not good enough.
Sorry's not good enough.
Sorry's not good enough
