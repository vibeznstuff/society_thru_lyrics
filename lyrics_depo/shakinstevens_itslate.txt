It's late
we gotta get on home
it's late
we've been gone too long.
Too bad
we should have checked our time

Can't phone
we've done spent ev'ry dime.
It's late
we're 'bout to run out of gas

It's late
we gotta get home fast.
Can't speed
we're in a slow down zone

Baby
look at that clock
why can't it be wrqng?
If we could have left home at a quarter to mne

We would have had fun and plenty of time

But we got started just a little bit late

I hope this won't be our last date.
Look up
is that the moon we see

Can't be
looks like that sun to me

It's late
I hate to face your dad

Too bad
I know he's gonna be mad

It's late
we gotta get on home

It's late
we've been gone too long.
It's late
we're 'bout to run out of gas
. . .
It's late
we gotta get on home

It's late
we've been gone too long.
It's late.
