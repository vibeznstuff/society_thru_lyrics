I can't take this situation
It's making me feel so blue 
One moment you walked into my life
And now
You're saying that we're through 


I hear that you're in love now
Baby, don't know what to say 
I can't believe that I still feel this way 
I hear that you're in love now 
Baby, don't know what to say 
But before you decide
You won't be mine
Put yourself in my place 


You know something will come around
You're gonna put yourself
(Put yourself) in my place 
When your lovers bring you down
And there no-one else around
You're gonna put yourself
(Put yourself) in my place 


There's no rhyme or reason
(Rhyme or reason)
That keeps me playing along
(That keeps me playing along)
I guess, that I'll just keep on believing 
Inside you love will;
Know right from wrong






In my place (put yourself) in my place 
Oh (put yourself)
