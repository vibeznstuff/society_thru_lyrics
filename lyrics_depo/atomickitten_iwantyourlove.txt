Move it right up to me,
Like you know you should,
And make me know you're doin,
All of the right things...

Coz makin lots of money,
And livin in a dream,
Is when you know you're doin,
All of the right things...

Push it, oh, don't push it,
Push it, oh, don't push it,
Push it, oh, don't push it...

Coz baby, I want your love,
I want your lovin baby,
Baby, I want your love,
Boom...

Bet you think you're funny,
Just hangin with my friends,
They make you think you're sayin,
All of the right things...

When you gonna wake up,
And when you gonna see,
That they're just glad you give me,
All of the right things...

Push it, oh, don't push it,
Push it, oh, don't push it,
Push it, oh, don't push it...

Coz baby, I want your love,
I want your lovin baby,
Baby, I want your love,
Boom...

Push it, oh, don't push it,
Push it, oh, don't push it,
Push it, oh, don't push it...

Push it, oh, don't push it,
Push it, oh, don't push it,
Push it, oh, just don't push it...

You said you're gonna call me,
And I wait by the phone,
I need to hear you sayin,
All of the right things...

Coz boy I got your number,
I'm tryin to play it cool,
But you'd better be doing,
All of the right things...

Push it, oh, push it,
Push it, oh, push it,
Push it...

I want your lovin baby,
Baby, I want your love,
Boom...

Coz baby, I want your love,
