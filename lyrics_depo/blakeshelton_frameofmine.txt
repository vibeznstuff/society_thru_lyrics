There's a picture of you on my dresser
And it's been there since you said goodbye
And when I look in it's direction
You're starin' my heart straight in the eye


It just sits there smilin' at me
Takin' me back in time
And before I know it
I'm all caught up in
That old frame of mine

I wish I could tear it to pieces
And I've tried with all of my might
But somehow I can't find courage
Oh, to let you out of my sight


It just sits there smilin' at me
Takin' me back in time
And before I know it
I'm all caught up in
That old frame of mine

Yea before I know it
I'm all caught up in
That old frame of mine
