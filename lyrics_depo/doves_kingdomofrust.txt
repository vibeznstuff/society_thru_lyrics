I hear a sound
A sound above my head
Distant sound of thunder
Moving out on the moor

Blackbirds flew in
Into the cooling towers
I'll pack my bags
Thinking of one of those hours
With you
Waiting for you

My god
It takes an ocean of trust
In the Kingdom of Rust

I long to feel
Some beauty in my heart
As I go searching
Right to the start

The road back to Preston
Was covered all in snow
As I went looking
For that stolen heart
For you
Waiting for you

My god
It takes an ocean of trust
Takes an effort, it does
My god
It takes an ocean of trust
It's in the Kingdom of Rust

In the Kingdom of Rust

I long to feel
That wince in my heart
As I went looking
I couldn't stop
Now I'm
Waiting for you

I know
It takes an ocean of trust
In the Kingdom of Rust
