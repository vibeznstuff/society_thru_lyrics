What's another heart to you?
You've broken quite a few
And what's another here or there?
Not enough to make you care, yes, you've had your fun
I've lost again
And you have won

No one can break a heart like you
No one can hurt the way you do
You laughed at me and said we're through
No one can break a heart like you
Now that you've found somebody new
He may believe that you'll be true
He'd run away if he but knew
No one can break a heart like you

Even though I love you so
I've got to let
You go
I have lost and I must pay
All around my world is gray
It will always be
Because you've gone away from me

No one can break a heart like you
No one can hurt the way you do
You laughed at me and said we're through
No one can break a heart like you
Now that you've found somebody new
He may believe that you'll be true
He'd run away if he but knew
No one can break a heart like you

No one can break a heart
Like you
