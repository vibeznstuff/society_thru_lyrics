He asked me for a dollar, I said "Go get a job"
I turned up my collar and started walkin' off
He said "I don't blame you, I know what you think.
I'd just spend your money, to buy another drink"

But you don't know Jack,
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks,
Until you've lost it all.
And you can't go back
To your life, and your kids, and your ex-wife
With just a telephone call.
If you think it's just a bottle,
In an old brown paper sack
You don't know Jack.

He showed me a picture, of two little girls
Wearin' Easter dresses, hair done up in curls
He said "God bless their mamma,
She said I couldn't stay.
And buddy if you're wonderin',
How could I throw it all away"

You don't know Jack,
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks,
Until you've lost it all.
And you can't go back
To your life, and your kids, and your ex-wife
With just a telephone call.
If you think it's just a bottle,
In an old brown paper sack
You don't know Jack.

If you never felt the fire,
Running through your veins,
If you've never seen the devil,
Face to face...

You don't know Jack,
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks,
Until you've lost it all.
So brother just be glad, and tonight
Hold your kids, kiss your wife
And when you talk to God,
Count up all your blessings
And thank the good Lord that
You don't know Jack.
You don't know Jack.
