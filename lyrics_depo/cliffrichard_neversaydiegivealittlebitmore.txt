You look so sad - like you lost your only friend
Don't feel so bad - you can always try again
So don't hide, go seek, don't let the grass grow
Under your feet
Get out, get up, get on, get moving out
Don't surrender - don't give up the fight

You give a little bit more
If you want her back - it's a full attack
You give a little bit more
And if you wanna win you don't give in you
Give a little bit more
When you think you're through what you gotta do is
Give a little bit more

She said goodbye
So tell yourself that's all
(That's all, she's gone)
But your hands ain't tied
Why you make yourself so small (don't think so small)
So don't hide - go seek - don't let the grass grow
Under your feet
Get out - get up - get on - get moving out
Don't surrender - don't give up the fight

You give a little bit more
If you want her back - it's a full attack
You give a little bit more
And if you wanna win you don't give in
Give a little bit more
When you think you're through what you gotta do you
Give a little bit more

Don't give up the fight - you gotta keep on
Going with all you might
Try hard don't stop - gotta keep on giving it
All you got
Never give up - never give up - never say die
Believe in, can reach the top
Gotta give it a shot don't say no gotta
Get in the flow

So don't hide go seek
Don't runaway - get back on your feet
Get out - get up - get on - get moving out
Don't surrender - don't give up the fight

You give a little bit more
If you want her back - it's a full attack
You give a little bit more
And if you wanna win you don't give in
Give a little bit more
When you think you're through what you gotta do
Give a little bit more
