Oh, oh mercy, mercy me 
Oh, things ain't what they used to be 
No, no 
Where did all the blue skies go? 
Poison is the wind 
That blows from the north, west, south and east 
Oh, oh mercy, mercy me 
Oh, things ain't what they used to be 
No, no 
Oil wasted on the oceans and our seas 
Fish full of mercury 
Oh, oh mercy, mercy me 
Oh, things ain't what they used to be 
No, no 
Radiation underground and in the sky 
Animals and birds who live nearby are dying 
Oh, oh mercy, mercy me 
Oh, things ain't what they used to be 
No, no 
What about this over-crowded land 
How much more abuse from man can she stand? 
I want you 
The right way 
I want you 
But I want you to want me too 
Said I want you to love me 
Just like I want you 
Oh, I'll give you all the love 
You want in return sweet darlin' 
Your happiness is all I crave 
Ooh, it's too bad - it's just too sad 
You don't want me now 
But I'm gonna change 
Your mind someway, somehow, baby 
I want you 
The right way 
I want you 
But I want you to want me too 
Said I want you to love me 
Just like I want you 
A one way love is just fantasy 
Oh, sugar 
To share is precious pure and fair, ooh 
Don't play with something 
You should cherish for your life, baby 
Don't you want to care? 
Lonely? 
I'm there
