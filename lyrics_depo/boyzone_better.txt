Our love has changed 
It's not the same 
And the only way to say it 
Is say it..it's better 

I can't conceal 
This way I feel 
For all the times we spend together 
Forever just gets better 

Seem what I'm try to say is 
You make things better 
And no matter what the day is 
With you here it's better 

I stand by you 
If you stand by me 
I think it's time that I reveal it 
Cause I believe it 
It's better 

Seem what I'm try to say is 
You make things better 
And no matter what the day is 
If you're here it's better 

Ooh the more I write song to you 
I'm fall in love with everything you do 

Oooh.. 

Seem what I'm try to say is 
You make things better 
And no matter what the day is 
With you here it's better 

Our love has changed 
It's not the same 
And the only way to say it 
Is say it..it's better
