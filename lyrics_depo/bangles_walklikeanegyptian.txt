All the old paintings on the tombs,
They do the sand dance,
Don't you know?

If they move too quick
They're falling down like a domino.

All the bazaar men by the Nile,
They got the money on a bet.

Gold crocodiles they snap their teeth
On your cigarette.

Foreign types with their hookah pipes say
Walk like an Egyptian.

The blond waitresses take their trays
They spin around and they cross the floor;
They got the moves.
You drop your drink then they bring you more.

All the school kids so sick of books,
They like the punk and the metal band.
When the buzzer rings,
They're walking like an Egyptian.

All the kids in the marketplace say:
Walk like an Egyptian.

Slide your feet up the street
Bend your back
Shift your arm and then you pull it back.

Life's hard you know
So strike a pose on a Cadillac.

If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop.
They sing and dance
Spin the clubs cruise down the block.

All the Japanese with their yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know
They walk the line like Egyptian.

All the cops in the donut shop say:
Walk like an Egyptian
Walk like an Egyptian.
