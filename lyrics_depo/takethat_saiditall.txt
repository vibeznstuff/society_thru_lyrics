When the tears fall away 
And there's no conversation 
There's nothing left to break 
That's not already broken 
You're staring into space 
And every inch of silence 
Been standing here for days, and days 

Said it all 
Nothing to say at all 
Nothing to say that matters 
Haven't we heard enough? 

Said it all 
Nothing to say at all 
Nothing to say that matters 
Doesn't matter any more 

In the sudden light of day 
The weight of expectation 
Hurt begins to fade 
As you find a new direction 
Been talking here for days and days and days 

Said it all 
Nothing to say at all 
Nothing to say that matters 
Haven't we heard enough? 

Said it all 
Nothing to say at all 
Nothing to say that matters 
Doesn't matter any more 

All of the miles of words we've spoken 
All of the lines that got away 
Didn't we take the time to say them all? 

All of the miles of words we've spoken 
All of the lines that got away 
Didn't we take the time to say them all? 

Said it all 
Nothing to say at all 
Nothing to say that matters 
Haven't we heard enough? 

Said it all 
Nothing to say at all 
Nothing to say that matters 
Haven't we said it all?
