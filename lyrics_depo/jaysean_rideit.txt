(Let me feel you)

It's been about a month and twenty days...
And we're going round and round playing silly games...
Now you're saying, slow it down, not right now...
Then you wink at me and walk away..

Now, let it be, let it be, let it be known...
Hold on, don't go...
Touching and teasing me, telling me no...
But this time I need to feel you...


(Ride it) we are all alone...
(Ride it) just lose control...
(Ride it, ride it) come touch my soul...
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you...
(Ride it) turn the lights down low...
(Ride it) from head to toe...
(Ride it, ride it) come touch my soul...
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you...

MoVida was the club on Saturday...
You're acting like a diva saying you don't wanna pay...
It's gotta be your feisty style...
Raised eyebrow...
I love it when you look at me that way...
Now when you order a Mojito at the bar...
We applying lippy cause it came off from the glass...
The DJ plays your favourite song...
Kanye's on...
Now your backing in from me to dance...
Mmmm... pulling me, pulling me, pulling me close...
You close your eyes girl...
Whispering, telling me we gotta go...
Won't you take me home?.. I wanna...



Everything was right until her phone begin to ring...
She takes it to the corner, that's when I start wondering...
I can hear her shouting, banging her fist against the door...
Yelling, "Yo, it's over, I can't take it anymore..."
Then I walk away, and act all nonchalant and chill
I ain't trying to get all caught up in a mess for real
But she came around and backed me up against the wall...
She said, "I know you heard, but I'll make you forget it all."



Baby let me feel you...
