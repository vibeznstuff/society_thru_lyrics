Well you can do it in your sleep and then you worry for a week
But with the magic up your sleeve
Everybody's falling at your feet, everybody's falling at your feet

But the liar gets the part 'cos the honest go too far
So when they laugh don't take it to heart
You made a plastiscenic work of art, a plastiscenic work of art

Save me, save me from the lies I've got in my mind
'Cos it's hard enough to see you're good on the inside
And the leaving when it works, the hardest to time
When your dealing in the dirt and healing the blind

You're looking down that telescope from the only end you know
Where life is big and we're still close
Everybody gets a second go, everybody gets another go

Save me, save me from the lies I've got in my mind
'Cos it's hard enough to see you're good on the inside
And the leaving when it works, the hardest to time
When your dealing in the dirt and healing the blind

Save me, save me from the lies I've got in my mind
'Cos it's hard enough to see you're good on the inside
And the leaving when it works, the hardest to time
When your dealing in the dirt and healing the blind

Save me, save me from the lies I've got in my mind
'Cos it's hard enough to see you're good on the inside
And the leaving when it works, the hardest to time
When your dealing in the dirt and healing the blind
