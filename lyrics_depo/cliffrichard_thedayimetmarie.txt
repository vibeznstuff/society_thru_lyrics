Imagine a still summer's day
When nothing is moving,
Least of all me.
I lay on my back in the hay,
The warm sun was soothing.
It made me feel good...

The day I met Marie.
The sound of her whisper "hello"
Came tiptoeing softly into my head.
I opened my eyes kinda slow,
And there she was smiling.
It made me feel good...

The day I met Marie.
With laughing eyes,
She'd toss her hair and tantalize.
She came to touch me then she's gone,
Just like a summer breeze.

I remember her kiss,
So soft on my brow,
And the way that she said,
"Baby go to sleep now,
Baby go to sleep now."

I woke with the chill in the air,
The warm sun no longer hung in the sky.
I reached out but she was not there.
She'd gone where she came from,
But I still feel good,

To think I've known Marie.
With laughing eyes,
She'd toss her hair and tantalize.
She came to touch me then she's gone,
Just like a summer breeze.
