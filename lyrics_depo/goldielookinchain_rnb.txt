There's this girl wot I've liked for time
I've tried to get her attention with a beat and a rhyme
She's really fcuking fit and she works down the shoe shop
But she's into R'n'B and not hip hop
So I'm back once again with a new melody
You've got the secrets, I've got the key
Let me start the ignition just like R Kelly
Come baby, come baby, ride with me


Come baby, come baby, baby baby come
Your love is the bullet, my love is the gun
Come baby, come baby, come with me
I'll take you on a journey through R and B


This is how it started, I remember how you laughed
When you met Jason Orange and asked him for an autograph
Before that time it was NKOTB
To you they were the greatest and the fan club was free
You got the photos, the tapes and the t-shirt
But when they finally split up I could see how much it hurt
Then other boybands came along and stopped the pain
But somewhere deep inside amongst the sunshine there was rain

Front to the back to the left to the right
Dye my hair, put in the highlight
A1, N'Sync and Blue, Westlife, 911, Take That too
I'll make a video walkin in the sand
Even do a solo deal, money in my hand
I'm not silly though cos I've got plans
Gonna change direction, gonna be a boyband


Come baby, come baby, baby baby come
Your love is the bullet, my love is the gun
Come baby, come baby, come with me
I'll take you on a journey through R and B

R and B, get high with me, R and B
Oh ohhh ohhh-ohhh


This is the love and your ear's the destination
Hip hop, R'n'B, beats across the nation
From the girls who love J.Lo, to all the men that wanna be Fat Joe
Yeah, it's an R'n'B to hip hop vibe
Gonna touch your missus but I'll keep it on the low ride
You know I wanna give you devotion
Feel my R'n'B emotion


When you're in a boyband, you're gettin lots of money
You get to drive fast cars and chill with the honeyz
You smoke blow and rap slow
Like Enya in Orinocho Flow
An ounce of weed, I'm on speed (?)
I run much faster, just what I need
Bad dance routines guaranteed
This chart hit makes your fcukin ears bleed


Woahh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooooh, yeah, yeah ,yeaaaaah
Oooooh, ooooooh

Arrrrr and Beeeeee


Come baby, come baby, baby baby come
Your love is the bullet, my love is the gun
Come baby, come baby, come with me
I'll take you on a journey through R and B

R and B...
