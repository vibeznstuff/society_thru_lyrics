Well, I know what you're after
It's a rock and roll disaster
Like you see in the papers
That you read on escalators

Did you smile 'cos you want it?
Did I put my finger on it?
It's a dream till you've lived it
To receive you've got to give it

Don't say anything
You're talking but you don't say anything
You don't do anything
You're moving but you don't do anything

So turn it up, turn it up
'Cos little love just ain't enough
Yeah, turn it up, turn it up
Ain't nobody wants to be alone
There ain't nobody wants to be alone

Did you notice
When you walked into the office
With a cup on a plastic tray
All the joys in life that have slipped away?
Did you notice?

You don't say anything
You're talking but you don't say anything
You don't do anything
Keep moving but you don't do anything

So turn it up, turn it up
'Cos little love just ain't enough
Yeah, turn it up, turn it up
There ain't nobody wants to be alone

Turn it up, turn it up
'Cos little love just ain't enough
Yeah, turn it up to big love
And when your heart is sinking like a stone
Ain't nobody wants to be alone

You don't say anything
You're talking but you don't say anything
You don't do anything
Keep moving but you don't do anything

Yeah, turn it up, turn it up
'Cos little love just ain't enough
Yeah, turn it up, turn it up
There ain't nobody wants to be alone

Yeah, turn it up, turn it up
'Cos little live just ain't enough
Yeah, turn it up to big love
And when your heart is sinking like a stone
Ain't nobody wants to be alone
