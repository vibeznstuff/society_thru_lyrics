There ain't no good in our goodbye-ing
True love takes a lot of trying
Ooooh I'm crying

Let's hang on to what we've got
Don't let go girl, we've got a lot
Got a lot o' love between us
hang on, hang on, hang on to what we've got
(Doo-woop, doo-woop, doo-woop)

You say you're gonna go and call it quits
gonna chuck it all and break our love to bits
(breaking up) I wish you never said it
(breaking up) No no, we'll both regret it

That little chip of diamond on your hand 
ain't a fortune babe but you know it stands 
(for your love) a love to try and bind us
(such a love) we just can't leave behind us 
Baby (don't you go) baby (no no no)

Baby (think it over and) stay-ay
Let's hang on to what we've got
Don't let go girl, we've got a lot
got a lot o' love between us
Hang on, hang on, hang on to what we've got
(doo-woop, doo-woop, doo-woop)

there isn't anything i wouldn't do
I'd pay any price to get in good with you
(patch it up) give me a second turnin'
(patch it up) don't cool off while i'm burnin'

you've got me cryin' dyin' at your door
don't shut me out, let me in once more
(open up) you're arms I need to hold you
(open up) you're heart oh girl I told you
Baby (don't you go) Baby (no no no)

Baby (think it over and) Stay-ay
Let's hang on to what we've got
Don't let go girl, we've got a lot
Got a lot o' love between us
Hang on, hang on, hang on to what we've got
(doo-woop, doo-woop, doo-woop)
