Are you aching for the blade?
That's okay, we're insured
Are you aching for the grave?
That's okay, we're insured

Getting away with it, all messed up
Getting away with it, all messed up
That's the living
We're getting away with it, all messed up
Getting away with it, all messed up
That's called living

Daniel's saving Grace
She's out in deep water
I hope he's a good swimmer
Daniel plays his ace
Deep inside his temple
He knows how to serve her

Getting away with it, all messed up
Getting away with it, all messed up
That's the living
We're getting away with it, all messed up
Getting away with it, all messed up
That's the living

Daniel drinks his weight
Drinks like Richard Burton
Dance like John Travolta now
Daniel's saving Grace
She was all but drowning
Now they live like dolphins

Getting away with it, all messed up
Getting away with it, all messed up
That's the living
We're getting away with it, all messed up
Getting away with it, all messed up
That's the living

Getting away with it, all messed up
Getting away with it, all messed up
That's the living
Getting away with it, all messed up
Getting away with it, all messed up
That's the living

Oh, we're getting away with it, all messed up
Getting away with it, all messed up
That's the living
Yeah, that's called living
