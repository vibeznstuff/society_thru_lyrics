Here I go again
Watch me now 'cause
Here I go again.

I've been hurt so much before
I told myself, yes I did
No more, no more won't get hurt any more

There I was all by myself
Doing all right
Until I saw you last night

And then I knew that
Here I go again
I can't help it
Here I go again

Makin' the same mistakes
Headin' for more heartaches
What can I do when there's nothing I can do
I looked in your eyes and I knew that I was through

What's the use
I'll just give in
Try as I may, and I do
I'll never win, never win, baby I'll never win.

Now, you're here, so close to me
I can't resist you
And I knew when I kissed you

I'm gonna say now
Here I go again
Watch me now 'cause
Here I go again

Falling in love, in love
Falling in love, in love
Falling in love, in love
Falling in love
