Here I am, I'm in a warm bed again
It's just a game I just can't win
There you are breathin' soft on my skin, yeah.
Still you won't let me in,
So come on


Why save your kisses for a rainy day
Baby let the moment take your heart away


Have you ever needed someone so bad, yeah
Have you ever wanted someone
You just couldn't have
Did you ever try so hard
That your world just fell apart
Have you ever needed someone so bad

And you're the girl I gotta have
I gotta have you baby, yeah.

There you go, midnight promises again, yeah
But they're broken by the dawn
You wanna go further, faster every day, baby
But in the morning you'll be gone
And I'm alone





Every dream I dream is like
Some kinda rash 'n' reckless scene
To give out such crazy love
You must be some kinda drug
And if my time don't ever come
For me you're still the one
Damned if I don't, damned if I do
I gotta get a fix on you


Have you ever needed someone so bad, yeah
Have you ever wanted someone
You just couldn't have
Did you ever try so hard
That your world just fell apart
Have you ever needed someone so bad, so bad


Have you ever wanted someone (have you ever wanted someone), yeah
Did you ever try so hard
That your world just fell apart
Have you ever needed someone so bad

And to the girl I gotta have
I gotta have you, baby, yeah, yeah

It's a game I just can't win, oh

Have you ever needed someone so bad, yeah
Have you ever wanted someone (have you ever wanted someone)
You just can't have
Did you ever try so hard
