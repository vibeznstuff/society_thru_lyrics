From a phone booth in Vegas Jessie calls at five a.m.
To tell me how she's tired of all of them
She says, "Baby, I've been thinking about a trailer by the sea
We could go to Mexico; you, the cat and me
We'll drink tequila and look for seashells
Now doesn't that sound sweet"
Oh Jessie you always do this every time I get back on my feet

Jessie paint your pictures
About how it's gonna be
By now I should know better
Your dreams are never free
But tell me all about our little trailer by the sea
Oh Jessie you can always sell any dream to me
Oh Jessie you can always sell any dream to me

She asked me how the cat's been
I say "Moses, he's just fine"
But he used to think about you, all the time
We finally took your pictures down off the wall
Jessie, how do you always seem to know just when to call
She says "Get your stuff together, bring Moses and drive real fast"
And I listened to her promise
"I swear to God this time it's gonna last"

Jessie paint your pictures
About how it's gonna be
By now I should know better
Your dreams are never free
But tell me all about our little trailer by the sea
Oh Jessie you can always sell any dream to me
Oh Jessie you can always sell any dream to me
Oh Jessie you can always sell any dream to me

I'll love you in the sunshine
Lay you down in the warm, white sand
And who knows maybe this time
Things will turn out just the way you planned

Jessie paint your pictures
About how it's gonna be
By now I should know better
Your dreams are never free
But tell me all about our little trailer by the sea
Oh Jessie you can always sell any dream to me
Oh Jessie you can always sell any dream to me
