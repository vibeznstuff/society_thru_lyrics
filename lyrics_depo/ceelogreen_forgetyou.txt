I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love and I'm like,
Forget you!
Oo, oo, ooo
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough I'm like,
Forget you!
And forget her too!
Said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some shit? (ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a...
Forget you!
Oo, oo, ooo

Yeah I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari,
But that don't mean I can't get you there.
I guess he's an Xbox and I'm more Atari,
About the way you play your game ain't fair.

I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(Oh shit she's a gold digger)
Well
(Just thought you should know nigga)
Ooooooh
I've got some news for you
Yeah go run and tell your little boyfriend



Now I know, that I had to borrow,
Beg and steal and lie and cheat.
Trying to keep ya, trying to please ya.
'Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap.

I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(Oh shit she's a gold digger)
Well
(Just thought you should know nigga)
Ooooooh
I've got some news for you
Ooh, I really hate your ass right now



Now baby, baby, baby
Why d'you wanna wanna hurt me so bad?
(So bad, so bad, so bad)
I tried to tell my momma but she told me
"This is one for your dad"
(Your dad, your dad, your dad)
Yes she did
And I was like
Uh! Whhhy? Uh! Whhhy? Uh!
Whhhy lady? Oh! I love you oh!
I still love you. Oooh!
