I am what I am
I am my own special creation
So come take a look
Give me the hook or the ovation

It's my world that I want to have a little pride in
My world and it's not a place I have to hide in
Life's not worth a dam
'Til you can say I am what I am

I am what I am
I don't want praise, I don't want pity
I bang my own drum
Some think it's noise, I think it's pretty

And so what if I love each sparkle and each bangle
Why not try to see things from a different angle
Your life is a sham
'Til you can shout out, I am what I am

I am what I am
And what I am needs no excuses
I deal my own deck
Sometimes the ace, sometimes the deuces

It's one life and there's no return and no deposit
One life. So it's time to open up your closet
Life's not worth a dam
'Til you can shout out, I am what I am

I am what I am
And what I am needs no excuses
I deal my own deck
Sometimes the ace, sometimes the deuces

It's one life and there's no return and no deposit
One life. So it's time to open up your closet
Life's not worth a dam
'Til you can shout out, I am what I am
