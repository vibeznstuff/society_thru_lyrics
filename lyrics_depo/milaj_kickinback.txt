I'm in airplane mode
I don't need no drama
Everybody know I ain't 'bout that drama
Oh yeah, Oh look at what I started
I'm a tell you right now
I plan on chillin' so hard right now
Ain't takin' no calls right now

I'm kickin' back and I'm lightin' up
Doin' what the fuck I want
Just rode a wood, I'm feelin' good
Just me, myself and this blunt

Everything I do is way up man
If anybody good I swear it's us man
I'm vibin', I'm chillin', I'm good

I'm kickin' back
And I'm vibin', I'm chillin', I'm good
I'm kickin' back
And I'm vibin', I'm chillin', I'm good

I'm kicking' back and I'm good
I'm kicking' back and I'm good

And I'm vibin', I'm chillin', I'm good
I'm kicking' back and I'm good

Everything good over here yeah
Everybody know I ain't 'bout that drama
Everything good over here yeah
Everybody know I ain't 'bout that drama
Oh yeah, Oh look at what I started

Man, first break in a minute
Can't remember not havin' to go to work
Chillin' by my mama crib
Food smellin' bomb
Man I even went to church

Full tank in the whip
Goin' for a lil drive can't hurt
Said I think I might just go for a ride
Then pop up and surprise some niggas that ain't heard from me

And I know they be missin' me
I was busy as ever
Feel good to be on
It feel good to be smokin' with all my niggas
Thinkin' 'bout the shit we used to be on
No lie man I really get the feeling that shit is comin' together
Good food, good weed
Saw the fam I ain't seen
And it couldn't get any better

I'm vibin', I'm chillin', I'm good
I'm kickin' back
And I'm vibin', I'm chillin', I'm good
I'm kickin' back and I'm good
I'm kickin' back and I'm good
I'm kickin' back
And I'm vibin', I'm chillin', I'm good
I'm kickin' back and I'm good

Man, you don't understand
When I land the first thing I be thinkin' about
Is goin' to Roscoes
You feel what I'm sayin'
Goin' to Simply Wholesome
Goin' to see my mama
Goin' to see my daddy
Goin' to the Fox Hill's mall
You know what I'm sayin'
Going to Slauson Super Mall
And you know just chill with my family
