I've been waitin'
Such a long time just tryin' to get through
And its takin' 
All of my strength to keep me here, away from you.

It doesn't matter just how long it takes
Nothing changes when we're apart
It's just a little bit longer, we've come this far!

One step closer to heaven baby
Means one step closer to you
There'll be no more livin' without you baby
I'm counting each minute 'till I'm back to you
One step closer to heaven baby
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on to my lovin'!

I've been savin' every little bit of my love for you
I've been dreamin' just to get by, 
It's so exciting, fantasisin'

It doesn't matter just how long it takes
Just to know we're back together
And this time .... it's forever!

One step closer to heaven baby
Means one step closer to you
They'll be no more livin' without you baby
I'm counting each minute 'till I'm back to you
One step closer to heaven baby
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on to my lovin'!

It doesn't matter just how long it takes
Nothing changes when we're apart
It's just a little bit longer, we've come this far!

One step closer to heaven baby
Means one step closer to you
They'll be no more livin' without you baby
I'm counting each minute 'till I'm back to you
One step closer to heaven baby
Means one step closer to you
They'll be no more livin' without you baby
I'm counting each minute 'till I'm back to you
One step closer to heaven baby
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on to my lovin'!
