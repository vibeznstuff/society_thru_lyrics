You 
You wake up to a new day 
Forwards 
We move towards a new way oh 
Come with me 
Gather with your torches 
Singing 
Dance by (night we all are strong)
A new day....oh, a new day 
A new way...oh, a new way 
Somewhere the sun shines in the east 
A new day....oh, a new day 
Touch me 
Tell me I'm still human 
and wild 
We'll run until we run (run long)
Our bodies talk, words are lost 
Hand in hand we follow 
All around 
A man becomes the people 
A new day....oh, a new day 

Somewhere the sun shines in the east 
A new way...oh, a new way 
A new day....oh, a new day 
You 
You caught me in your spell 
Hypnotized 
You touched me and now I'm gone
Conflict 
Every day the same 
Wishing 
Wishing we could see the way 
A new day....oh, a new day 
A new way...oh, a new way 
A new day....oh, a new day 
Somewhere the sun shines in the east 
We watch the sun rise in the east 
A new day....oh, a new day 
A new day....oh, a new day 
A new day....oh, a new day 
A new day....oh, a new day
