One last thing before I shuffle off the planet,
I will be the one to make you crawl,
So I came down to wish you an unhappy birthday.

Someone call the ambulance..There's gonna be an accident.

I'm coming up on infra-red, there is no running that can hide you,
'Cause I can see in the dark.
I'm coming up on infra-red, forget your running, I will find you.

One more thing before we start the final face-off,
I will be the one to watch you fall,
So I came down to crash and burn your bagger's banquet.

Someone call the ambulance..There's gonna be an accident.

I'm coming up on infra-red, there is no running that can hide you,
'Cause I can see in the dark.
I'm coming up on infra-red, forget your running, I will find you.
(find you)



I'm coming up on infra-red, there is no running that can hide you,
'Cause I can see in the dark.
I'm coming up on infra-red, forget your running, I will find you.

I'm coming up on infra-red, there is no running that can hide you,
'Cause I can see in the dark.
I'm coming up on infra-red, forget your running, I will find you.

I'm coming up on infra-red, there is no running that can hide you,
'Cause I can see in the dark.
I'm coming up on infra-red, forget your running, I will find you.
Find you.
Find you.
Find you.
