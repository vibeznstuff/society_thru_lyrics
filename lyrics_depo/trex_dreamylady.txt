O dreamy lady
Won't you come
To my bed
Night is the right time
To get acquainted with my head
In my bed

Star light is shinning
Silver baby hold me tight
Moon beams are twining
In the portals of my sight
You're so right

Na, na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Will you still love me

Oh dreamy lady
