Don't let it stand out in the cold
Don't let it fall into a hole
With someone you know
Don't let it out in the cold
Don't let it fall into a hole
With someone you know
Can't get out of bed
You're keeping it straight
This city's a mess
Can't get out of bed
You're keeping it, keep on, get it together
Is this everything you wanted to be, wanted to be, wanted to be
Don't let it stand out in the cold
Don't let it fall into a hole
With someone you know
Don't let it out in the cold
Don't let it fall into a hole
With someone you know
Won't get off the phone
You're holding the rocks
And feeling it all
Won't get off the floor
You know that we're all going off to nowhere
You're nothing that you wanted to be, wanted to be, wanted to be
Can't come in the role
You're filling the holes
And ruining your clothes
Can't get out of bed
It's nothing and no one's coming over to me there
It's nothing that you wanted to be, wanted to be
Wanted to be
Wanted to be
Wanted to be
