Turn the beat around
Love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down
Love to hear percussion
Love to hear it

Blow horns you sure sound pretty
Your violins keep movin' to the nitty gritty
But when you hear the scratch of the guitar scratchin'
Tthen you'll know that rhythm carries all the action, so

Turn the beat around
Love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down
Love to hear percussion
Love to hear it

Turn the beat around
Love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down
Love to hear percussion
Love to hear it

Flute player play your flute 'cause
I know that you want to get your thing off
But you see I've made up my mind about it
To me it is the rhythm, no doubt about it, woah woah
'Cause when the guitar player starts playing
With the syncopated rhythm, with the scratch, scratch, scratch
Makes me wanna move my body, yeah, yeah, yeah
And when the drummer starts beating that beat
He nails that beat with the syncopated rythm
With the rat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, on the drums, hey

Turn the beat around
Love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down
Love to hear percussion
Love to hear it

Turn the beat around
Love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down
Love to hear percussion
Love to hear it
