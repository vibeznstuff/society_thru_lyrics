I'm going to places we used to go
I still see people we used to know
Friends they ask me where is she now
I have to tell them we're over now

When at first you left I thought I'd surely die
I couldn't see a future without you by my side
We're not together but I'm still alive
I'd rather not see you for a really long time

Funny how love is
Funny how love is
Funny how love is

I don't want your magazines I don't want your cloths
Take them from my house let me be alone
Never try to catch me again or call me on the phone
Don't send me letters I don't want to know

When at first you left, I thought I'd surely die
I couldn't see a future without you by my side
We're not together but I'm still alive
I'd rather not see you for a really long time

Funny how love is
Funny how love is
Funny how love is

Love is so funny, the joke is on me  
Funny how love is...
