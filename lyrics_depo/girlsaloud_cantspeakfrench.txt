I wait underneath the covers
All night beside ya
And who could ever question any crying I do
My heavy heart is beating out a rhythm
All night beside me
And I fall a little harder everytime that I do

Watch me living it up, ya totally
Got me stuck in a rut, ya made for me
How am I gonna step up, and say to you
I get the feeling boy I want you, want you

(Now) conversation is tough because you're totally
Walking around all the stuff you wanna say to me
Words are never enough
Oh baby baby you turn my dust to gold

I can't speak French
So I'll let the funky music do the talking talking
I can't speak French so I'll let the funky music do the talking
I can't speak French
So I'll let the funky music do the talking talking
I can't speak french
So I'll let the funky music do the talking

I gotta let you know
I wanna give in to my temptation
And let my feelings show
I gotta let you know

I can't speak French
So I'll let the funky music do the talking talking
I can't speak French so I'll let the funky music do the talking
I can't speak French
So I'll let the funky music do the talking talking
I can't speak french
So I'll let the funky music do the talking
