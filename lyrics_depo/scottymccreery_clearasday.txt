You were sitting on that Silverado bumper
Outside our locker room after the game
Glowing in the tan you got that summer
I walked by and you said 'Hey'
Yeah, that night's still clear as day

First time we'd ever beaten East Lincoln county
Big party down at Ricky Bowman's place
I walked up, you threw your arms around me
You whispered you loved to watch me play
Yeah, that night's still clear as day


There ain't one second times erased
Every detail is still in place
You hold to what you love
Some things never fade
And that night's still clear as day

We went to get some fresh air on the back porch
I put my class ring by the cross on your gold chain
You backed my back against those cedar clapboards
My lips ain't never kissed that way
Yeah, that night's still clear as day


There ain't one second times erased
Every detail is still in place
You hold to what you love
Some things never fade

I walked you to your brother's Silverado
When you climbed behind the wheel you seemed OK
Last thing you said was "I'll call you tomorrow"
That's a call you never got to make

They blamed it on the fog and pouring rain

That night's still clear as day
