Ain't nobody gonna treat you better
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better
Ain't nobody gonna love you better
Boy, than I am, than I am

When you're out at night and you're in the streets
And you have time to yourself
Think of all the love that you get from me
That you can't find nowhere else

When you're far away and I'm not around
And temptation fills your heart
Think of all the ways that I'm faithful, babe
And to replace me would be hard, 'cause there's nobody

Ain't nobody gonna treat you better
(No, nobody)
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better
(Nobody)
Ain't nobody gonna love you better
(No)
Boy, than I am, than I am

(Nobody, nobody)
Than I am
(Nobody, nobody)
Than I am
(Nobody, nobody)
Ohh, nobody's gonna treat you as good as I am

You can try to act single if you wanna
You can go ahead and mingle if you wanna
You can even behave like
You don't care

But you know
(But you know)
Like I know
(Like I know)
That you ain't that foolish, who you foolin'?
You won't ruin what's been here all along
You ain't movin' from what you got at home

Ain't nobody gonna treat you better
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better
(Ain't nobody gonna touch you)
Ain't nobody gonna love you better
Boy, than I am, than I am

(Nobody, nobody)
Than I am
(Nobody, nobody)
Than I am
(Nobody's gonna touch you)
(Nobody, nobody)
Ohh, nobody's gonna treat you as good as I am

I just want you to know, baby, I love you so
There is no need to go lookin' for nothing more
'Cause I've got everything you'll ever need right here
But if you feel that you need to leave, just know

Ain't nobody gonna treat you better
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better
(Ain't nobody)
Ain't nobody gonna love you better
Boy, than I am, than I am

Ain't nobody gonna treat you better
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better
Ain't nobody gonna love you better
Boy, than I am, than I am

(Nobody, nobody)
Than I am
(Nobody, nobody)
Than I am
(Nobody, nobody)
Ohh, nobody's gonna treat you as good as I am

(Nobody, nobody)
Than I am
(Nobody, nobody)
Than I am
(Nobody, nobody)
Ohh, nobody's gonna treat you as good as I am

As I am
As I am
Ohh, nobody's gonna treat you as good as I am

(Nobody, nobody)
As I am
(Nobody, nobody)
As I am
(Nobody, nobody)
Ohh, nobody's gonna treat you as good as I am
