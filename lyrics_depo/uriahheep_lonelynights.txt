Will you risk your reputation
I don't know
You just don't know what you're saying
Anymore
You know beggars can't be choosers
And it's bad
We may win, we may be loosers
I don't care, no no no

Oh baby, I just can't stand
Another lonely night
So come on over and save me
Save me from another lonely night

I hear every word you're saying
They're all lies
But with every breath you're taking
You're thinking of a ways to say goodnight

Baby, I just can't stand
Another lonely night
So come on over and save me
Save me from another lonely night
Come on over
Come and save me
