I sleep with my hands across my chest
And I dream of you with someone else
I feed my body with things that I don't need
Until I sink to the bottom
Don't act like it came as a surprise
Don't believe me? Then look into these eyes

This can't go on so I should just
Regret it, regret it, regret it
And even though I led you on
Forget it, forget it, forget it

I'm going missing for a while
I've got nothing left to lose
I don't listen to anything

I still remember how you moved
And I taste you scent upon my lips
How it started, I will never know
But now I've reached my limit

This can't go on so I should just
Regret it, regret it, regret it
And even though I led you on
Forget it, forget it, forget it

I'm going missing for a while
I've got nothing left to lose
I don't listen to anything

I'm going missing for a while
I've got nothing left to lose
I don't listen to anything

Do you ever want to wear your body out
Until there's nothing left to take?
The rain began to push you away
Has midnight come too soon again?

I'm going missing for a while
I've got nothing left to lose
I don't listen to anything

I've got nothing in defence
I've got nothing left to lose
I don't listen to anything

I sleep with my hands across my chest
And I dream of you with someone else
