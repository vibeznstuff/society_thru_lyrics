Look through any window yeah, what do you see?
Smilin' faces all around rushin' through the busy town

(Where do they go) movin' on their way
Walkin' down the highways and the by-ways
(Where do they go) movin' on their way
People with their shy ways and their sly ways

Oh you can see the little children all around
Oh you can see the little ladies in their gowns when you

Look through any window yeah, any time of day
See the drivers on the roads pullin' down their heavy loads

(Where do they go) movin' on their way
Drivin' down highways and the by-ways
(Where do they go) movin' on their way
Drivers with their shy ways and their sly ways

Oh you can see the little children all around
Oh you can see the little ladies in their gowns when you

Look through any window yeah, what do you see?
Smiling faces all around rushin' through the busy town

(Where do they go)
Movin' on their way
Movin' on their way
Movin' on their way
