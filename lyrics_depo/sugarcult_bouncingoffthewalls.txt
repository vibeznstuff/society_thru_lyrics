I'm bouncing off the walls again (whoa oh)
I'm looking like a fool again (whoa oh)
I threw away my reputation
One more song for the radio station

I'm bouncing off the walls again (whoa oh)
I'm looking like a fool again (whoa oh)
Waking up on the bathroom floor
Pull myself back together just to fall once more

And my heart's beating out of my chest
And this town is still making me sick
And every penny from my last paycheck
I've blown it on you

I'm bouncing off the walls again (whoa oh)
And I'm looking like a fool again (whoa oh)
So go ahead and take a picture
And hang it up so you can tear me down

I don't care
Cause I'm still here
And I've got nothing left to lose
With all the years I wasted on you

Momma and Daddy's got the best cocaine
Ritalin's never gonna feel the same
Twenty-four hours on an empty brain
I got my finger on the trigger and your in my way

I'm bouncing off the walls again (whoa oh)
And I'm looking like a fool again (whoa oh)
I threw away my reputation
One more song for the radio station

I'm bouncing off the walls again
And I'm looking like a fool again
I'm bouncing off the walls again
And I'm looking like a fool again
I'm bouncing off the walls again
