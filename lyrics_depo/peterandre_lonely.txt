Do,do,do,do,do,do
Do,do,do,do,do,do

Ooooooooooohhhh Baaaaby

Have you ever heard the words, I just don't care
Baby please forgive the foolish heart, that sold you bare
When the road got rough, I started doubting myself
Still I can't believe that life's worth living
With anybody else

So why do we say goodbye
When we know we'll only cry
We're gonna be lonely (gonna be lonely)
And why do we fool ourselves
Saying there'll be someone else
For me there's you only (gonna be lonely)

All we need to make it right is precious time
But it's funny such a simple thing's so hard to find
Don't know when or where we started living separate lives
But I know it's still worth fighting for, I see it in your eyes

So why do we say goodbye
When we know we'll only cry
We're gonna be lonely (gonna be lonely)
And why do we fool ourselves
Saying there'll be someone else
For me there's you only (gonna be lonely)

Now I realise that I've been living so selfishly
Somewhere along the way I forgot you had your own hopes and dreams
I never meant to make you weak, but I was too blind to see
I've been hurting you how I made you blue, now guilt is killing me

So why do we say goodbye
When we know we'll only cry
We're gonna be lonely (gonna be lonely)
And why do we fool ourselves
Saying there'll be someone else
For me there's you only (gonna be lonely)
