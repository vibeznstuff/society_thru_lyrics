You can't overestimate the limits of aggression of an animal created in the image of God himself
You can't allow for subtle defects, there's no time to reflect, there's no time to cover your tracks
It's not a mistake to fear an animals own limited access,the plan just keeps without his hopes and dreams
such a cause of satisfaction, such a cause of action, search evaluate and destroy.

I am man, i'm a superstar, i shine so bright, a worldwide success
I said hammer it home, i'm a superstar, a glowing example of a dream come true.
I am a man, I'm a work of art, I'm fashioned in God's own image, I am holy and clean
I am a man, I'm a superstar, I shine so bright, a worldwide success

Let me curl myself into a ball before you let me understand
Let me curl myself into a ball before you let me understand
Make me realize

You can't underestimate the feeling of attraction of the animal in question to the marvel of what he's made
You can't escape the sense of pride, he's created a divide between, you'll suffer it to rain on his parade.

Don't even think about it, it's enough to read about it
Force an animal to circle and keep an eye on you should you decide to have a go and try to rattle his cage

I am a man, I'm a gift to the world, I wish I was born as civilised and set free
I am a man, I'm a market tool, the sell of the century of the bargain of a lifetime
Hammer it home, I'm a superstar, a glowing example of a dream come true

Let me curl myself into a ball before you let me understand
Let me curl myself into a ball before you let me understand
Make me realize

Havin' a ball just being a man
Livin' it up just being a man
It sure as hell rocks just being a man
There's nothin quite beats just being a man like being a man
