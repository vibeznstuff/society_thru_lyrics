You can't stop an avalanche
As it races down the hill
You can try to stop the seasons,
But you know you never will
And you can try to stop my dancin' feet
But I just cannot stand still

Cause the world keeps spinnin'
Round and round
And my heart's keeping time
To the speed of sound
I was lost till I heard the drums
Then I found my way
Cause you can't stop the beat

5, 6, 7, 8

Ever since this old world began
A woman found out if she shook it
She could shake up a man
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it
The best that I can today
Cause you can't stop
The motion of the ocean
Or the sun in the sky
You can wonder if you wanna
But I never ask why
If you try to hold me down
I'm gonna spit in your eye and say
That you can't stop the beat!

You can't stop a river
As it rushes to the sea
You can try to stop the hands of time
But you know it just can't be
And if they try to stop us Artie,
I'll call the N Double A C P

Cause the world keeps spinning
Round and round
And my heart's keeping time
To the speed of sound
I was lost til I heard the drums
Then I found my way
Cause you can't stop the beat

Ever since we first saw the light
A man and woman liked to shake it
On a Saturday night
So I'm gonna shake and shimmy it
With all my might today
'Cause you can't stop
The motion of the ocean
Or the rain from above
You can try to stop the paradise
We're dreamin' of
But you cannot stop the rhythm
Of two hearts in love to stay
Cause you can't stop the beat!

You can't stop today
As it comes speeding down the track
Child, yesterday is history
And it's never coming back
Cause tomorrow is a brand new day
And it don't know white from black

Yeah!

Cause the world keeps spinning
Round and round
And my heart's keeping time
To the speed of sound
I was lost til I heard the drums
Then I found my way
'Cause you can't stop the beat

Ever since we first saw the sun
A man and woman liked to shake it
When the day is done
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it
And have some fun today
Cause you can't stop
The motion of the ocean
Or the rain from above
They can try to stop the paradise
We're dreaming of
But you cannot stop the rhythm
Of two hearts in love to stay
You can't stop the beat!

You can't stop the beat!
You can't stop the beat!
You can't stop the beat!
You can't stop the beat!
