I know where all that time has gone
Blown and drifted, listening to an August night
I see where I was wrong
But how could I know that you were right
When you said I would need something wild
Something crazy to carry me
I would see you naked and weary
But with pride in your eyes that put shame in me

I wait to find the things I need but I know

I want that love
King of Emotion
Stronger than you and so much deeper than me
I know that love is King of Emotion
King of Emotion take a walk with me
I know that love is King of Emotion
King of Emotion take a walk with me

You know where all that time has gone
Grown up and left, washed out like an April day
See all those pretty little things you knew
Worn and faded they lie cast away
You said you would need something wild
Something special to carry you
You would see me naked and weary
But with pride in my eyes that put shame in you

Until you find the things you need I know

I want that love
King of Emotion
Stronger than you and so much deeper than me
I know that love is King of Emotion
King of Emotion take a walk with me
I know that love is King of Emotion
King of Emotion take a walk with me

Until we find the things we need I know

I want that love
King of Emotion
Stronger than you and so much deeper than me
I know that love is King of Emotion
King of Emotion take a walk with me

I want that love
King of Emotion
Stronger than you and so much deeper than me
I know that love is King of Emotion
King of Emotion take a walk with me
