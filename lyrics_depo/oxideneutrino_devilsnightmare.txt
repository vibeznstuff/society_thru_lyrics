I can be evil,
I can be good
But I don't know
If I really should
Be evil to those jealous
That want to
Try and intimidate me

Dare you step into my land
Come imitate me
Like a foolish man
Enter your dreams
Like Freddy Krueger
Rip out ya brains
The dark intruder

Hellraiser another dimension
Terrorise ya soul
Now that's my intention
Vampire Count Dracula,
Bite your neck
Who haha

Hunt you down
I come tear out your heart
Werewolf I'm coming in dark
Zombified now mummification,
You'll be
If you mess with my patience

I can be evil,
I can be good
But I don't know
If I really should
Be evil to those jealous MCs
That want to
Try and intimidate me

Dare you step into my land
Come imitate me
Like a foolish man
Enter your dreams
Like Freddy Krueger
Rip out ya brains
The dark intruder

Hellraiser another dimension
Terrorise ya soul
Now that's my intention
Vampire Count Dracula,
Bite your neck
Who haha

Hunt you down
I come tear out your heart
Werewolf I'm coming in dark
Zombified now mummification
