I think that you're the one
When everytime you call me lady
I don't know what it is
That makes me feel like this just lately yeah


Those heavenly calls
You knew I was on my own
Those heavenly calls
We stepped into the unknown


Let me sleep
So I can dream of you
Let me sleep
So I can be with you


What's a girl to do when she's alone
With you just tell me
And here we are again yeah acting
Like we're friends just help me







Hold me close, let me be with you

At least tonight, won't be misunderstood



Let me sleep
Oh let me sleep
Let me sleep so I can dream of you
Let me sleep so I can be with you
Let me sleep so I can dream of you
Let me sleep so I can be with you
Let me sleep 
Let me sleep so I can be with you
