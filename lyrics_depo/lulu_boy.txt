Nothing inside you, just anger and rage 
Drinks a substitute, soul betrayed 
You'll never change

Nothing in your life, fights backstage 
Trying for attention, making us afraid 
You're downright insane

Oh rock 'n' roll boy 
You think you're cool 
Oh rock 'n' roll boy 
You just sit there and drool 
You drool and drool

Nothing to tell us, nothing to say 
No direction, fame is just your game 
You're so damned vain

Oh rock 'n' roll boy 
You think you're cool 
Oh rock 'n' roll boy 
You just sit there and drool 
You drool and drool

Nothing to care for, can't even pull 
You think you're sexy, you're so uncool 
Try to impress me, you fool

Oh rock 'n' roll boy 
You think you're cool 
Oh rock 'n' roll boy 
You just sit there and drool 
You drool and drool

Nothing to care for, can't even pull 
You think you're sexy, you're so uncool 
Try to impress me, you fool
