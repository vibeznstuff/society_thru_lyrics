Then came the night
I was alone
alone
big empty bed all on my own
alone
All in my glory such a sad story
moment by moment I go mad
so mad.
How did it come this pretty path
you ask?
Why did he leave
no
I don't know
they go.
Ill find another
maybe his brother

Ill move to the next without a pause
because
I love men. What can I do? I love men they're no good for you.
In the end they always resist and pretend you didn't exist.
But my friend
they somehow persist and remain at the top of my list.
I love men
I love men
love them over and over and over again.

I love men it's always the same
I love men I'm bad at the game.
Can't defend the way that I feel
it's no trend the feeling is real.
Now and then I try to conceal where and when I choose to reveal.
I love men
I love men
love them over and over and over again.

Good times may come and they may go. I know.
Money goes fast but it comes slow
so slow

One thing is certain
love's final curtain
wont leave me bereft while there is one man left.
I love men
it's going to last
I love men
the feeling wont pass.
I love men wherever I go
all these men they're haunting me so.
Miles of men as far as I see
Smiles of men they're smiling at me.
I love men
I love men
love them over and over and over again.

I love men. What can I do?
I love men they're no good for you.
In the end they always resist and pretend you didn't exist.
But my friend
they somehow persist and remain at the top of my list.
I love men

I love men
I love men

I love men
it's going to last
I love men
the feeling will pass

I love men
