If you wish upon the stars
Will they give you all you ask?
You never know, you never know
If you wander from the path
Will you come to any harm?
You never know, you never know

Got the key to fit the lock
Time to stop the clocks
Leave the fear behind

We can light up the world
With the secret we're keeping, I know you believe it
Light up the world
With the secret we're keeping, I know you believe it

Do you cross your heart
Does it make you who you are?
You never know, you never know
If the spark becomes a flame
Would it warm, or cause you pain?
You never know, you never know

Got a key to fit the lock
Time to stop the clock
Leave the fear behind

We can light up the world
With the secret we're keeping, I know you believe it
Light up the world
With the secret we're keeping, I know you believe it

Imagination will set you free
Everything isn't all that it seems
Just gotta break it down, just gotta work it out
Then you'll understand, you're gonna understand

We can light up the world
With the secret we're keeping, I know you believe it
Light up the world
With the secret we're keeping, I know you believe it
