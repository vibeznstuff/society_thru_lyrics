Never thought I'd have a worry for me to be alone
Playing near or far too many times should have known
It can lose you all sleep at night
Twelve bar blues is now alright
Now it's up to you to try and find the reason to
Rock 'n' Roll and every song
Rock 'n' Roll and everyone
It's Rock 'n' Roll and Rock and Rock 'n' Roll
It's Rock 'n' Roll and Rock keeps rollin' on
Waiting all the time to find radio plays on Caroline
They say you'll get there in the end
We can pray, what we say
Makes a difference in the end

Looking back it can be funny, it can be very strange
Everything we do, it's funny, we never rearrange
It can lose you all sleep at night
Twelve bar blues is now alright
Now it's up to you to try and find the reason to
Rock 'n' Roll and every song
Rock 'n' Roll and everyone
It's Rock 'n' Roll and Rock and Rock 'n' Roll
It's Rock 'n' Roll and Rock keeps rollin' on
Waiting all the time to find radio plays on Caroline
They say you'll get there in the end
We can pray, what we say
Makes a difference in the end

Rushing always in a hurry, and try to give it up
Everything we do it's funny, it's never good enough
It can lose you all sleep at night
Twelve bar blues is now alright
Now it's up to you to try and find the reason to
Rock 'n' Roll and every song
Rock 'n' Roll and everyone
It's Rock 'n' Roll and Rock and Rock 'n' Roll
It's Rock 'n' Roll and Rock keeps rollin' on
Waiting all the time to find radio plays on Caroline
They say you'll get there in the end
We can pray, what we say
Makes a difference in the end
