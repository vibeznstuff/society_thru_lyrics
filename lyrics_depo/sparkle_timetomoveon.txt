It's time to move on
(Oooh, yeah)
Said I'm tired of hangin' on
(Tired of hangin' on, yeah)
It's time to move on
(Ooh, boy)
Said I'm tried of hangin' on
(Hanging on boy)

Lookin' back on all the years I gave ya, boy
And all the promises you made to me
Back then I was too damn blind to see
All of my time invested in this love affair
With working two jobs
Cookin and cleaning
But yet ya still wanna clown on me

It's time to move on
(I can not go on my baby)
Said I'm tired of hangin' on
(To all of your phoney promises, boy)
It's time to move on
(I can't take no more of the headaches and pains)
Said I'm tried of hangin' on
(Said I'm better off gone)

The picket fence, the house, the things we talked about
They're all gone, boy
And I don't regret how the shit went down
We don't talk the way we used to talk
So what's the use of me stayin' here with you

It's time to move on
(Yeah, I can not go on my baby, boy)
Said I'm tired of hangin' on
(See I get lonely, yes I do)
It's time to move on
(Fed up with all those things you've done)
Said I'm tried of hangin' on
(Said I'm better off gone)

La la la la la la la
La la la la la
It means I love you
But I can't keep you
La la la la la la la
La la la la la
It means I'm movin' 
On without you boy

24/7, good lovin' is what you missed out on, boy
We coulda had it all, 'stead I'm gone

It's time to move on
(Time to move on, yes it is)
Said I'm tired of hangin' on
(To all of your phoney promises, boy)
It's time to move on
(I can not go on my baby)
Said I'm tried of hangin' on
(Whew, move on, move on, move on, yeah)

It's time to move on
(See I shoulda left yo' ass long time ago)
Said I'm tired of hangin' on
(I can do bad all by myself, yes I can)
It's time to move on
(I found out that you were even tryin' to talk
to some of my girlfriends)
Said I'm tried of hangin' on
