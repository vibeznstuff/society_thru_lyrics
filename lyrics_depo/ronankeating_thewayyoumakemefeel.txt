Couldn't feel much better
Than the way
I feel tonight
Feel like I
Could live forever
Feel like I
Could fly
When I thought
I'd get it wrong, yeah
You somehow
Make things right


That's the way
You make me feel
Better than
I've ever known it
Better than
It's ever been
I can't seem
To control it, no
The way you make me feel
Like the sun coming up
In the morning
Like holding the world
In your hands
In a way I could
Never imagine (yeah)
The way you
Make me feel

I couldn't feel much better
Than when
I'm here with you
You make everything
Seem so easy
I'm telling you the truth
You never try
To please me
But somehow
You always do



The way you
Make me feel, yeah
The way you
Make me feel

The simple things
You do to me
Simple things you say
I sometimes can't believe
It's for real



The way you
Make me feel, yeah
The way you
Make me feel
The way you
Make me feel
