Oh boy,
If you ever have to let me down
In this world,
My life surely
Would be upside down

If you ever find,
That your peace of mind,
Is shattered in so many ways and
I find my feet
Down on lonely street,
I'll be stood there waiting for you
Boy you got me.

Oh yeah,
Let me look into your deep brown eyes,
Let me share,
Every moment
Every sweet surprise.

See that I have grown
And need mercy shown,
There's a window to my heart,
If i find my feet
Down on lonely street,
I'll be stood there waiting for you,

Boy, you've got me
High
Boy, you've got me
High.
Boy, you've got me
High
Boy, you've got me
High

But if I find my feet
Down on lonely street
I'll be stood there waiting for you
Boy you've got me
