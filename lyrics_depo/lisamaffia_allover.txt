All the thugs in the clubs get your cris on ice
Ladies in the club shake your body like dice
My kind of jam so we're doing it right
Yo, who got the inflow keeping it tight
Lisa Maffia
Remember I told you, I'm a soldier
Drop this in the club and it's all over
It's all over
It's all over

Tonight leave out the crib with the Gucci prize
Christian Dior boots, Fendi life
Then be my girls roll up in the night
Outside the club security tight
Skip through the queue to the door on the right
Up on the floor by the bar what do you like
Time out bezzel techno ice
I'm in the wrong room this is techno night
Into room two playing joints I like
Breakers being Harlem shaking all night
And if you're in the mood grip left and right
Party all night we don't want to fight
Solid we buy bars for the crew in sight
In the VIP Dready be bringing the vibes
One glass of verve two shots of ice
Ladies shake your ass all night



Lisa say its all over 
Me done tell ya bout how a skyla, skyla 
Don't watch dem gals dem a filler, filler 
Look like some old school thriller, thriller 
Why is there no champagne in the chiller 
My flows you don't know them be iller 
If you no cook you no get no dinner 
Me lose ya mind me a winner, winner 

Move your nastiness 
You can't chat to this 
Respect this 
Recognise this 
Realise this 
A big bad blows meat interprise this 
So solid hot, cannot despise this 
you cant hide this 
you cannot deprive this 
we move fast so you cannot collide this 
Everything right so you can't rectify this 
Ha, you're an idiot 
Lisa come done this 

 

It's me again Mega pumpin' the Gs my friend 
The ladies all say I do this with ease 
Begin to tease the  then go 
Platinum freeze on them 
And come so stupid that they're 
Shaking their knees and blend 
Maffia with some low down soldier lyrics 
You got one in it when 
So solid is turning believe it 
All those dreams OK I can give you a minute 
Take that La Senza off of your whole spirit 

 

Yes, It's all over Lisa Maffia
