I remember us alone
Waiting for the light to go
Don't you feel that hunger
I've got, so many secrets to show
When I saw you on that stage
I shiver with the look you gave
Don't you hear that rhythm
Can you show me how we can escape


I was biting my tongue
I was trying to hide
I'll forget what I've done
I will be redefined


It's shaking the sky and I'm following lightning
I'll recover if you keep me alive
Don't leave me behind, can you see me, I'm shining
And it's you that I've been waiting to find


I'm holding it all tonight
I'm folding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find

Now that we can hear that sound
Now that you can hold me down
You can pull me under
You can raze everything to the ground
Everything I can arrange
Every part of me you change
Just hold me together
Tell me, you'll always want me to stay





Wanna be the one you steal
I wanna be the one you shield
I wanna be the one that your love, that your love can heal
I wanna be the one you steal
I wanna be the one you shield
I wanna be the one that your love, that your love...




I'm holding it all tonight
I'm folding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find

It's you that I've been waiting to find
