You think that we connect
That the chemistry's correct
Your words walk right through my ears
Presuming I like what I hear
And now I'm stuck in the
The web you're spinning
You've got me for you prey


(Yeah) Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message
And I'll call you back
A likely story, but (Yeah) leave a message
And I'll call you back

You're intruding on what's mine
And you're taking up my time
Don't have the courage inside me
To tell you, "Please let me be"
Communication, a telephonic invasion
I'm planning my escape...




And it's all your fault
I screen my phone calls
No matter who calls
I gotta screen my phone calls

Now it's gone to deep (Now, it's gone too deep)
You wake me in my sleep (Wake me in my sleep)
My dreams become nightmares (Dreams become nightmares)
'Cause you're ringing in my ears





Oooh, the spiderwebs
Leave a message and I'll call you back
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So, leave a message and I'll call you back
I'm walking into spiderwebs
It's all your fault, no matter who calls
I gotta screen my phone calls
It's all your fault, it's all your fault

No matter who calls, no matter who calls

I'm walking into spiderwebs so,
Leave a message and I'll call you back

I'm walkin into spiderwebs
Leave a message and I'll call you back
Ooh, it's all your fault
No matter who calls
I gotta screen my phone call

It's all your fault
No matter-matter-matter who calls
I screen my phone calls


I'm walkin into spiderwebs
Leave a message and I'll call you back
