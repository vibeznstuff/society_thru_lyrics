Sometimes I think about
What life was like before
Was it full of old remedies
That kept me reaching for the door
But I know this love is unconditional (yeah)
Deep inside you're my living joy (yeah yeah)

I'm gonna sing you a lullaby
A thousand times or more
You're a sweet as a butterfly
Baby all I need and more
Gonna sing you my song
Cos I think the world about you
You're the only one that matters now
Since the day you were born

The first time I looked at you
On the Friday afternoon
Your eyes were all a wondering
Who am I and who are you?

But I know our love is unconditional (our love, yes it is)
Deep inside you're my living joy (my living joy, yeah yeah)

Gonna sing you a lullaby (all night)
A thousand times or more (all night long, yeah)
You're a sweet as a butterfly (butterfly)
Baby all I need and more (all I need and more)
Gonna sing you my song
Cos I think the world about you (think so much about you)
You're the only one that matters now
Since the day you were born (day you were born)

Oh oh, thousand times or more
Oh oh, all I need and more
Sing you my song
Think the world about you
Day you were born

But I know this love is unconditional (yes it is)
Deep inside you're my living joy (my living joy)

Gonna sing you a lullaby
A thousand times or more
You're a sweet as a butterfly
Baby all I need and more
Gonna sing you my song
Cos I think the world about you
You're the only one that matters now
Since the day you were born

Gonna sing you a lullaby
A thousand times or more
You're a sweet as a butterfly
Baby all I need and more
Gonna sing you my song
Cos I think the world about you
You're the only one that matters now
Since the day you were born
