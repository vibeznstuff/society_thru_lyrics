All I do every night is think about you
All I do every night is think of you

Are we lost or is this love that I'm feeling?
Your burning touch is something that keeps on healing

And we can talk about it, wake me up if I'm dreaming
Are we lost or is this love that I'm feeling?

You stay on my mind, on my mind every night
You stay on my mind, you're on my mind every night

Only us, nothing else that I'm needing
It's you I trust, the only one I believe in

And we can talk about it, wake me up if I'm dreaming
Are we lost or is this love that I'm feeling?

You stay on my mind, on my mind every night
While you stay on my mind, on my mind every night
Yeah, you stay on my mind, on my mind every night
You stay on my mind
You, yeah, you stay on my mind every night

All I do every night is think about you
All I do every night is think of you
All I do every, all I do, all I do every
All I do every, all I do, all I do every

You stay on my mind, on my mind every night
You stay on my mind, on my mind every night
You stay on my mind, you stay on my mind every night
You stay on my mind
You, yeah, you stay on my mind every night
You stay on my mind, you stay on my mind every night
You stay on my mind
You, yeah, you stay on my mind every night
