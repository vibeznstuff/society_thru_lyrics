Say everything's better in the daylight
So why'd you leave me in the dark?
If you're gonna say something, say something
Don't say nothing
And you believe in something 'cause it sounds right
And when you told me what I wanna hear
Don't just say nothing, say nothing
Just say something

Don't blame me
For the mess that you've been causing
I believe
Every word you didn't say
Now I see
You're only gonna break me down

If you wanna say something
Man up, don't say nothing
Oh, I speak the truth (yeah, yeah)
If you wanna say something
Silence don't mean nothing
But it does to you
Heard the silence become a part of you

I been dreaming of your silhouette all night
'Cause I haven't seen it all
If you wanna say something, say something
Don't say nothing

Don't blame me
For the mess that you've been causing
I believe
Every word you didn't say
Now I see
You're only gonna break me down

If you wanna say something
Man up, don't say nothing
Oh, I speak the truth (yeah, yeah)
If you wanna say something
Silence don't mean nothing
But it does to you
Heard the silence become a part of you

No, I'm not on my knees
Begging for you
For you to comfort me
No, I don't want that
Just needed your honesty
But all I want now
Is for you to speak to me
Like you never did

If you wanna say something
Man up, don't say nothing
Oh, I scream the truth (yeah, yeah)
If you wanna say something
Silence don't mean nothing
But it does to you (yeah, yeah)
If you wanna say something
Man up, don't say nothing
Or I scream the truth (yeah, yeah)

If you wanna say something
Silence don't mean nothing
But it does to you
Now the silence is part of me and you
