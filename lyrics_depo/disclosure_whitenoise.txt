I know you're smart.
You spin me round like a knot
You know the pieces, pieces of my heart.
Sometimes its fun, you pull my strings one by one.
Until you get me, get me, onto one.
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough, then let's play rough.
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough, then let's play rough.
I don't need you, giving it straight to me, giving it straight to me
Just gonna get my back.
I don't need you, telling me how to be, telling me how to be
Just gonna get my back.
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Back, back, back
Back. back, back
Back, back.


Just noise, white noise.
Just noise, white noise.
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying.
Just noise, white noise.
Just noise, white noise.
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying.


Only you can look at me the way you do
You always tint me tint me black and blue
Such a shame, you frame me with such disdain
You got me washed out, washed out colour drained.
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough, then let's play rough.
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough, then let's play rough.
I don't need you, giving it straight to me, giving it straight to me
Just gonna get my back.
I don't need you, telling me how to be, telling me how to be
Just gonna get my back.
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Back, back, back
Back. back, back
Back, back.



Just noise, white noise.
Just noise, white noise.
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying.

(Hear me crying)
(Hear me crying)
(Just noise)
(Just noise)
