Enter the dragon.
I was just kickin out some karate kicks,
With some tantalising lyrics!

Send this one to all lyric lovers.
With the unknown, Sharky P, Melody, DT

Woo Woo. 

Woo!

Do you really like it?
Do you really like it?
We're lovin' it
Lovin' it, lovin' it
We're lovin' it
Like that

Do you really like it?
Is it, is it wicked?
We're lovin' it
Lovin' it, lovin' it
We're lovin' it like that

(Switch!)

Hardcore!
You know the score
Rhymes so good
I deserve an award
All that style we bring,
Will make you laugh
Like you was
A little child again
Smooth, that's how I roll
I've got so much soul 
I wanna I step into the party
I wanna move somebody
I wanna move somebody
We're the masters of the ceremony.
What does it take
To be a garage MC?
Personality
Originality
On a microphone
They got to be (yeah!)

The capital U.N. the K.N.O
Will get down
Represents our London towns
Pied Piper's on the decks
Rock the discotheque
And I'm back in a sec'

This one's for
The heads out there
Party people
Can you hear me play it?
If you like it
Let me see your
Hands in the air
If you don't
Y'all get the hell
Out of here

Bass is kickin'
Drums is drummin'
When you hear "du-du-du"
I'm comin'
Sharky represents
The west of London
DT, Piper, Melody and unknown
Represents the rest,
How we flex,
North, South, East, West.
Do you really like it?
Du Du Du Du,
YES!
We're gunna drop them lyrics
Over Piper's face,
5 Blackstreet ladies if you need a place,
We're gunna take you to wonderland just like Alice,
Place where the music, 
Ain't loud but lavish.

We're lovin' it
Lovin' it, lovin' it
We're lovin' it
Like this
We're lovin' it
Lovin' it, lovin' it
We're lovin' it like that
DT, Melody, Sharky, P
Enough to make you rock
Sing, we come to sing
And dance till we drop

Do you really like it?
Do you really like it?
We're lovin' it
Lovin' it, lovin' it
We're lovin' it like this
Do you really like it?
Is it, is it wicked?
We're lovin' it
Lovin' it, lovin' it
We're lovin' it like that

Ooh,
How you like my...
How you like my...
How you like my style?

Do you really like it?
Is it, Is it Wicked?

(Switch!)

Oooh,

(Switch!)

On your marks,
Get set,
Let's go.
Five, four, three, two, one and zero. 
Get on, Jump, And do the limbo.
Check we go,
Check we go,
Check we go, 
BLO!
Aint you in this sound?
Do you really wanna get down?
Hit that mix,
Hit that blend,
Back to Back now,
Makin it back now (when?!)
(That's right, That's right!)
And when you're with Melody,
I'm the one wit' the team, 
wit' the team,
wit the free.
Peace and love wit the skibadee 
And that's the way that it's got to be. 
It goes down with a one and two,
And selecta, you know the coo.
Gunna get down with the original fun,
Pied Piper gunna make you hype for the sky.


Jump, don't ever stop
With a little bit of this
Little bit of that
Jump, don't ever stop
With a little bit of this
Little of that that
Jump, don't ever stop
With a little bit of this
Little of that that
Jump, don't ever stop
With a little bit of this
Little bit of that
Little bit of fun
Little bit of jokes
Little bit of jinx
Little bit of smoke
Little bit of this.
We do bravo,
We do bravo,
We do bravo.
Jump, all the one-step crews
all the one-step crews
all the one-step crews,
Jump, all the one-step crews

Lookin' sexy.
