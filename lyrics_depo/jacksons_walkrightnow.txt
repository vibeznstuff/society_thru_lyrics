Here, when all my work is done, babe
She calls and she says
Dear, can I come
I say to her
That you know our love has gone
But agressive heart
No, really not the one
She comes to the door
Crying at my feet
Guilt shines in her eyes
As she slowly sinks in deep

You know our love couldn't last forever
Persuade your way
But you ain't clever
I close the door and I say never

(I don't care)
What you're saying
(Walk right now)
I ain't playing
(Love elsewhere)
For you I'm praying
(Don't look back)
You ain't staying

Here, I'm crying
I can't sleep
I sigh
'Cause I thought this would never be
I say ooh
I'm screaming out for someone
And now she's knochin' on the door for me
She just won't leave me alone
She wants to speak with me
And persuade me in her arms
And now she's calling on the phone for me
Oh, just won't leave me alone

Deep down inside she's trying to be clever
To love once more then leave me forever
I close the door and I say never

(I don't care)
What you're saying
(Walk right now)
I ain't playing
(Love elsewhere)
For you I'm praying
(Don't look back)
You ain't staying

(I don't care)
What you're saying
(Walk right now)
What you're doing to me
(Love elsewhere)
What you're doing to me
(Don't look back)
Wooo!

I try so hard to cope with you
I can't bear the things you put me through
To love as friends
No, I wish that we could see
But persuasive heart
Just won't let pure friendship be

You know our love couldn't last forever
Persuade your way
But you ain't clever
I close the door and I say never

(I don't care)
What you're saying
(Walk right now)
I ain't playing
(Love elsewhere)
For you I'm praying
(Don't look back)
You ain't staying

(I don't care)
What you're saying
(Walk right now)
I ain't playing
(Love elsewhere)
For you I'm praying
(Don't look back)
What you're doing to me

(I don't care)
What you're doing to me
(Walk right now)
What you're doing to me
(Love elsewhere)
What you're doing to me
(Don't look back)
Wooo!

No, babe

(I don't care)
(Walk right now)
(Love elsewhere)
(Don't look back)
(I don't care)
(Walk right now)
(Love elsewhere)
(Don't look back)
(I don't care)
