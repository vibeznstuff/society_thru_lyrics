The shit that you promote
Fighting, fuckin'
Like you don't want to grow
Your talking so much sex
But you not tell the youth 'bout AIDS
You not tell them 'bout consequence, no
Your talking like you a G
But you are killer killing your own
Your just a racist man's pussy
Tell me who wants to know
What when who where
Or how you do your hoe's

Certainly not me
Certainly not me
'Cause baby personally
I like to be challenged mentally
I've heard it all before
Gangsta's pimps and whores
Quality is poor
A girl like me needs more

It takes more (takes more)
To amuse a girl like me
So much more (much more)
To confuse a girl like me
They've got you (got you)
'Cause while you braggin' 'bout your badness your just
Avoiding, adding
To the real shit thats happenin' to us

Now who gives a damn
About the ice on your hands?
If its not too complex
Tell me how many African's died
For the baguettes on your Rolex?
So what you pushing a nice car
Don't you know there's no such thing as superstar
We leave this world alone
So who gives a fuck about the things you own?

Certainly not me
Certainly not me
'Cause baby personally
I like to be challenged mentally
Your shit's insignificant
And it don't help to pay my rent
Its pure negativity
That you impose on me

It takes more (takes more)
To amuse a girl like me
So much more (much more)
To confuse a girl like me
They've got you (got you)
'Cause while you braggin' 'bout your badness your just
Avoiding, adding
To the real shit thats happenin' to us

Now I can sit
And chat shit about dicks and sex
But my business is my business I got self respect
I can talk 'bout how my press could pimp man's dough
Get the keys to his ride and his home
But I looked it up and that would make me a ho'
Little sisters now I really gotta let you know
Real woman ain't sexin' for no mans dough
Real woman work hard to make the dough
And we can all chat 'bout gats and blacks
On blacks and force the hypes and all the stereotypes
We're used to watching, but that ain't what I'm here for
Show them to think higher and aspire for more

It takes more (takes more)
To amuse a girl like me
So much more (much more)
To confuse a girl like me
They've got you (got you)
'Cause while you braggin' 'bout your badness your just
Avoiding, adding
To the real shit thats happenin' to us

It takes more (takes more)
To amuse a girl like me
So much more (much more)
To confuse a girl like me
They've got you (got you)
'Cause while you braggin' 'bout your badness your just
Avoiding, adding
To the real shit thats happenin' to us
