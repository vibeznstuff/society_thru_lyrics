You said you loved me way too soon,
Gave me the sun, when all I wanted was the moon,
Never out your sight, holding my hand just a little too tight,

Sipping on your beer can, waiting for an answer,
I wish we could slow down, you want to go faster
You said you loved my way too soon,
You've known me 24 days so how can that be true?

You don't know my mind then again nor do I,
Cause you made me smile… a lot

Oh whoops I think I miss you too late, cause I got rid of you,
Think I might got this wrong, sorry but I didn't know you were the one,
Oh no, I got so scared, convinced myself that I didn't really care,
Now I know that you're the one, sorry that I've been so dumb,

Dumb, dumb, d-d-dumb, dumb 
Sorry that I've been so dumb

I miss you calling late at night, waking me up just to see if I'm alright,
Missing all the PDAs, even when you know that it's not the time or place,

Swallowing my pride now, waiting for an answer, promise you the next time I'll try a little harder,
Now I know where I went wrong, do you ever really know what you got until its gone,

I'll stay by your side through the rain and shine,
Cause you made me smile… a lot

Oh whoops I think I miss you too late, cause I got rid of you,
Think I might got this wrong, sorry but I didn't know you were the one,
Oh no, I got so scared, convinced myself that I didn't really care,
Now I know that you're the one, sorry that I've been so dumb,

Dumb, dumb, d-d-dumb, dumb 
Sorry that I've been so dumb

I don't care I'll wait all year not gonna move from your front door,
Just calm down, hear me out, starting from now I'll never let you down,

I'll stay by your side through the rain and shine,
Because you made me smile… a lot

Oh whoops I think I miss you too late, cause I got rid of you,
Think I might got this wrong, sorry but I didn't know you were the one,
Oh no, I got so scared, convinced myself that I didn't really care,
Now I know that you're the one, sorry that I've been so dumb,

Dumb, dumb, d-d-dumb, dumb 
Sorry that I've been so dumb

Dumb, dumb, d-d-dumb, dumb 
Sorry that I've been so dumb

Dumb, dumb, d-d-dumb, dumb 
Sorry that I've been so dumb
