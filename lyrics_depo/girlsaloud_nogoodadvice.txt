Daddy told me look into the future 
Sit at your computer, be a good girl 
And Mama said remember your a lady,
Think before your play and straighten your curls,

Well everybodys talking like i'm crazy 
Dangerous and lazy girl with no soul 
But i've seen it all from where i'm hiding 
Baby cause i'm sliding, out of control 


Here I go, off the road crank the stereo
I flick my finger to the world below 
Here I am, dirty hands, i don't give a damn 
Shut your mouth because it might show


I don't need no good advice 
I'm already wasted 
I don't need some other life 
Cold and complicated 
I don't need no Sunday trips
Tea and sympathising
I don't need no special fix 
To anaesthetise me

Daddy always told me to remember, 
Leave the boys, till later, don't you drop down 
Mama said I'd never get to heaven 
Hanging till eleven, with the wrong crowd 

Everybody's talking like I'm only
Just another phony girl who got played 
But i dig the music that i'm making 
Baby, and i'll break it into your brain 








I don't need no good advice
No well intentioned sacrifice
I don't need no Sunday trips
No chocolate box or speed for kicks
Hell I don't need no beauty sleep
No need to count those dirty sheep
And I don't need no bedtime prayer
Cos frankly I don't even care
