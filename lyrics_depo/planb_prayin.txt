Lord above, I just killed a man, let somebody take the blame
Lord above, I'm kneeling down, I'm prayin' take away this pain all up in here
I'm prayin', oh Lord I'm prayin' to you, take away this guilt all up in my head
I'm pleadin', oh Lord I'm pleadin' with you, we got some dealin's to do before the day I'm dead

He came for me, just like I knew he would, but this time I was ready and I killed him good
But he weren't alone, there was one more left, he took my weapon from me, put it to the test
That's when this angel appeared, out of the door with The Devil in his eyes, but God in his heart
He slayed him down, saved me from a sudden death, but I've still done wrong

So now I'm prayin', oh Lord I'm prayin' to you, take away this guilt all up in my head
I'm pleadin', oh Lord I'm pleadin' with you, we got some dealin's to do before the day I'm dead

So there we are, an angel and a man, both just standing there, blood on our hands
"What we gon' do now?" is what I thought, but before I could say it, the angel talked
He said "I'm in here for life anyway, you're only in here for 5, I'll take the blame"
He said "Go right now, don't feel ashamed" but oh Lord I do, that's why I'm prayin'

I'm prayin', oh Lord I'm prayin' to you, atone me from these sins weighing down on my soul
I'm pleadin', oh Lord I'm pleadin' with you, you got some healing to do, inside I'm feeling low

So now I'm prayin', oh Lord I'm prayin' to you, take away this guilt all up in my head
I'm pleadin', oh Lord I'm pleadin' with you, we got some dealin's to do before the day I'm dead
I'm prayin', oh Lord I'm prayin' to you, atone me from these sins weighing down on my soul
I'm pleadin', oh Lord I'm pleadin' with you, you got some healing to do, inside I'm feeling low
