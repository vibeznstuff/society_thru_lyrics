I don't know
Why these people can't get it on
And what you didn't know
That its just people having fun, yeah

I thought that there was something going wrong with me
I thought that everyone in this life should be free
But now I'm feeling lost and something here is wrong
Would you come and let me sing to people
Come and help me sing this song

Dance for the freedom
Fighters of the world
Feel the walls
She's real real love
They don't love you
They love you on your way
I don't love you babe though
It's ok

Yeah

In this rain
It makes it harder than it needs to be
What you didn't know
That is it always gonna stay this way, yeah

I thought that there was something going wrong with me
I thought that everyone in this life should be free
But now I'm feeling lost and something here is wrong
Would you come and let me sing to people
Come and help me sing this song

Dance for the freedom
Fighters of the world
Feel the walls
She's real real love
They don't love you
They love you on your way
I don't love you babe though
It's ok

Dance for the freedom
Fighters of the world
Feel the walls
She's real real love
They don't love you
They love you on your way
I don't love you babe though
It's ok

Its just another song yeah
Nah nah nah no
