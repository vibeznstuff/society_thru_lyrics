You and I were so in love, 
Nothing could ever come between us,
And me and you were so confused, 
And now we're left in broken pieces.
I know that the faster you rise, the faster you fall,
We were one, and now we don't care at all.
You and I just can't be free, 
Now all I know is we used to be real.

We used to be real,
We used to be real,
We used to be real,

You and I were far too young,
Thought that we knew what we were feeling,
But me and you, we had no clue, 
And now we're lost and have no meaning.

We know that we need to let go,
This is the end of the road,
Don't hold back, we can get by on our own.
You and I just can't be free, all I know is we used to be real.

We used to be real,
We used to be real,
We used to be real,
We used to be real,
We used to be so real, yeah.

Ain't no happy ending
When we're living life pretending, 
No answer to our questions, 
We're just too far gone.
Remember we had everything, 
We were so complete, 
Now we're nothing like we used to be, yeah~

We used to be real,
We used to be real,
We used to be real,
We used to be real,
Oh yeah, we used to be so real, used to be, used to be...

You and I were so in love, nothing could ever come between us,
And me and you were so confused, and now we're left in broken pieces,
I know that the faster you rise, the faster you fall,
We were one and now we don't care at all.
You and I just can't be free, now all I know is we used to be real.

We used to be real,
We used to be real,
We used to be real,
We used to be real,
Oh yeah, we used to be so real,
We used to be real,
We used to be so real
So real real real real
We used to be real.
