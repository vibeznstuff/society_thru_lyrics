Thought I understood
All the things that you told me
You were going through
Tried to be there and wanted to pull you through
And show you how much you're loved

Made a song and dance
Whenever I would ask you
Just what was wrong
You would say something like nothing hon
All along telling me a lie

If you really cared, cared about me
Then you would care about, care about us
If you cared about me, yeah
You would have cared about love

Felt betrayed, I was giving good loving
Yet still you strayed, wasn't I good enough
You were, oh, so sweet
I guess it was your sweetness that blinded me

If you really cared, cared about me
Then you would care about, care about us
If you cared about me, yeah
You would have cared about love

If you cared you would be there for me
You wouldn't have left me feeling lonely
If you really cared then you would have cared about us
Cared about love

Said you cared, now you're asking for forgiveness
It's much too late, I don't want you near
If you cared about me
Then you would have cared about love

If you really cared, cared about me
Then you wouldn't have hurt me as you did
If you cared about me
Then you would have cared about love

If you really cared, cared about me
Then you wouldn't have hurt me as you did
If you cared about me
Then you would have cared about love

When you really cared, cared about me
Then you wouldn't have hurt me as you did
If you cared about me
Then you would have cared about love
