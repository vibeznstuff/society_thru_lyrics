When I'm calling you, ooh
If you answer too, ooh

That means that I offer my love to you
To be your own
If you refuse me, I will be blue
And waiting all alone

But, if when you hear
My love call, ringing clear, ooh
And I hear you're
Answering a call so dear, ooh

Then I will know
That our love will be true
You belong to me
I belong to you, ooh, ooh, ooh
