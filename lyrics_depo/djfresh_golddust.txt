It's like gold dust 
Ya hear me coming through your speakers
You see me mashin' up your air waves
I know you can't get enough of my sound 

It's like gold dust 
Ya hear me coming through your speakers
You see me blaggin' up your air waves
I know you can't get enough of my sound 

There's no place to hurt yourself
The fight - I'm gonna get it
Tallest running for me
Baby, you're gonna regret it 
I can't understand why you can't free yourself, let it 

Go, go, go, go 

Got you in my Palm, now listen good, you can't escape it
Bring you to ma world and hold you, see if you can take it
Don't you be afraid, I know you're strong enough to make it

Go, go, go, 

It's like gold dust 
Hear me coming through your speakers
You see me mashin' up your air waves
I know you can't get enough of my sound 

It's like gold dust 
Hear me coming through your speakers
You see me blaggin' up your air waves
I know you can't get enough of my sound

Everything your life's been searching for's in this direction 
Come a little closer
Don't you feel the intersection?
We gon' take you down and then we gonna keep you sweating 

Go, go, go, go

Take you two around, you never known it's non-existant
You won't hear it coming, no matter how hard you listen
Can't predict the highway, bring a replay our position

Go, go, go, go 

I don't know where you run from, what you're running from, whoa 
I don't know where you run from, what you're running from, whoa 
I don't know where you run from, what you're running from, whoa 
Oh, you won't bring up yourself on fly 

People, put your hands up in the air, I know you like it 
Don't you fight it, I can see you're high and all excited 
Flying through the night, we going up, beter hold tight it 

Go, go, go, go 

Now we got the starline and the g-tha to desire
Let me see you jump up, come on, with me - let's go higher 
Climbin' up the speakers, we gonna set this place on fire 

Go, go, go, it's like...

Gold dust 
Hear me coming through your speakers
You see me mashin' up your air waves
I know you can't get enough of my sound

It's like gold dust
Hear me coming through your speakers
You see me blaggin up your air waves
I know you can't get enough of my sound

You keep runnin' and you're runnin'
And you're runnin' and you're runnin' away, away, away, boy 
You keep runnin' and you're runnin'
And you're runnin' and you're runnin' away, away, away
You keep runnin' and you're runnin'
And you're runnin' and you're runnin' away, away, away, boy 
You keep runnin' and you're runnin'
And you're runnin' and you're runnin' away 

Go, go, go

This is gold dust
