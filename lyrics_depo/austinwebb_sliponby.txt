Early morning by the riverside
Saw an old man waiting for a bite
We started talking and he took me back in time
He said I was young and thought I'd always be
Then I woke up, now I'm 83
There's so much I missed
Oh how I wish I could get back all that time I wasted

I see the tears of a young bride
The morning that we had our first fight
I should've held her tight
And on the day that my momma died
I hung up the phone and never said goodbye
Don't let it slip on
Don't let it slip on
Don't let it slip on by

Well he looked up with tears in his eyes
Said I'm not sure if you were looking for advice
There's just something about you
That reminds me of me
It ain't easy always looking back
But it seems these days that it's all I have
And what hurts me the most is knowing what could have been
And if I listen real close sometimes I can

Hear the sound of my little boy
Saying, "Daddy can you come play with me?"
But I was too busy
Then one day my baby grew up and went to war
I never thought he'd be gone in the blink of an eye
So don't let it slip on
Don't let it slip on
Don't let it slip on by

I shook the old man's hand and I thanked him
And I drove home as fast as I could go
Just to let her know
That I need her
That I love her
That I'm never gonna let another moment like this slip on by
Don't let it slip on by

We're only here for a little while
And God gives us only so much precious time
Don't let it slip on
Don't let it slip on
Don't let it slip on by

Don't let it slip on by
