Whoa, huh
Whoa, huh, hey
Whoa, huh
Whoa, huh, hey

Whoa, huh
Whoa, huh, hey
Whoa, huh (Whoa, huh)
Whoa, huh, hey

Do your dance to the rhythm
On the floor we're just havin' fun
Well, do your dance to the rhythm
On the floor we're just havin' fun, hey

We gon' start at midnight
Party till the mornin' light
You see, we can't give up or stop until we get it right
Ain't that right, ain't that right, woo

Do your dance to the rhythm
On the floor we're just havin' fun
Come on, people, do your dance to the rhythm
On the floor we're just havin' fun, hey

Well, there's a message for your body in this song
Can't you feel it, it's tellin' you, "Let's get it on"
So let's get it on (Lady)
Get on up (Hey), give it up (Well)

Good music makes you feel like dancin'
(Don't it make you feel good, don't it make you wanna get down)
Good music
Shake it up, shake it 'round

Well, I want everybody to get an attitude (Get an attitude)
Come on, people, right till it feels good, put your hand on your hip
And get into this groove, woo

Do your dance to the rhythm
On the floor we're just havin' fun

Do your dance to the rhythm
On the floor we're just havin' fun

Do your dance to the rhythm
On the floor we're just havin' fun
Do your dance to the rhythm
On the floor we're just havin' fun

Good music makes you feel like dancin'
(Don't it make you feel good, don't it make you wanna get down)
Good music
Do your dance, do your dance

Do your dance to the rhythm
On the floor we're just havin' fun
Do your dance to the rhythm
On the floor we're just havin' fun

Do your dance to the rhythm
On the floor we're just havin' fun
Do your dance to the rhythm
On the floor we're just havin' fun

Do that dance
Do that dance

Do your dance, do your dance

We don't need no music
We're gonna get on down tonight
We are gonna groove
Keep your body movin'
We got too much soul
Come on and let's get down
We're gonna groove, we got to move
Let me see you move

Good music makes you feel like dancin'
Do your dance, do your dance
