A summer evening on Les Champs Elyses
A secret rendezvous they planned for days
I see faces in the crowded cafe
A sound of Laughter as the music plays.

Jeanne-Claude's student at the University
Louise-Marie is just a world away
You recall the night they met was warm with laughter
The words and music as she turned away.


I'll meet you at midnight
Under the moonlight
I'll meet you at midnight
Oh, but Jeanne-Claude, Louise-Marie will never be

Each cigarette will light a thousand faces
The shade is passing like a thousand years
Midnight was turning into empty spaces
The sound of laughter'd disappeared



A summer morning on Les Champs Elyses
The entertainment in the street cafe
The sunlight melting through an open doorway
Jeanne-Claude has left some other day...
