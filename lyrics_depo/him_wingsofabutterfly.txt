Heaven ablaze in our eyes 
We're standing still in time 
The blood on our hands is the wine
We offer as sacrifice 


Come on, and show them your love 
Rip out the wings of a butterfly
For your soul, my love
Rip out the wings of a butterfly
For your soul

This endless mercy mile 
We're crawling side by side 
With hell freezing over in our eyes 
Gods kneel before our crime


Come on lets show, them your love
Rip out the wings of a butterfly
For your soul, my love
Rip out the wings of a butterfly
For your soul
(Rip out the wings of a butterfly)
Don’t let go
(Rip out the wings of a butterfly)
For your soul


Come on, and show them your love 
Rip out the wings of a butterfly
For your soul, my love
Rip out the wings of a butterfly
For your soul
(Rip out the wings of a butterfly) 
Don’t let go
(Rip out the wings of a butterfly) 

For your soul
