I've been looking for an original sin
One with a twist and a bit of a spin
And since I've done all the old ones
Till they've all been done in
Now I'm just looking
And I'm gone with the wind
Endlessly searching for an original sin

You can dance forever
You've got a fire in your feet
But will it ever be enough
You know that it'll never be enough
You can fly and never land
And never need to sleep
But will it ever be enough
You know that it'll never be enough
It's not enough to make the nightmares go away
It's not enough to make the tears run dry
And who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men today
It's a city of shadow
It's a city of light
It's a city of secrets
It's a city of pride

It'll all be over now
All I wanted was a piece of the night
I never got an equal share
When the stars are out of sight
And the moon is down
The natives are so restless tonight
All I needed was a spot in the light
It never had to get so dark
When the stars are out of sight
And the moon is down
The natives are so restless tonight

I've been looking for the ultimate crime
Infinite victims, infinitesimal time
And I'm so, so very guilty for no reason no rhyme
So now I'm just looking and I'm killing some time
Endlessly searching for the ultimate crime

You can lose yourself in pleasure
Till your body's goin numb
But will it ever be enough
You know that it'll never be enough
It's not enough to make the nightmares go away
It's not enough to make the tears run dry
And who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men today
It's a city of shadow
It's a city of pride

It'll all be over now
All I wanted was a piece of the night
I never got an equal share
When the stars are out of sight
And the moon is down
The natives are so restless tonight

I've been looking for an original sin
One with a twist and a bit of a spin
And since I've done all the old ones
Till they've all been done in
Now I'm just looking
And I'm gone with the wind
Endlessly searching for an original sin

I've been looking for an original sin
One with a twist and a bit of a spin
And since I've done all the old ones
Till they've all been done in
Now I'm just looking
And I'm gone with the wind
Endlessly searching for an original sin

I'm applying for a license to thrill
Going out on the edge, moving in for the kill
And they'll be hell to pay someday
Put it all on the bill
Cause we'll always be paying and paying until
We're beyond expiration with a license to thrill

I've been looking for an original sin
