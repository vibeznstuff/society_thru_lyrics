When I get older
I will be stronger
They'll call me 'Freedom'
Just like a wavin' flag

And then it goes back
And then it goes back
And then it goes back

Born to a throne,
Stronger than Rome
But violent-prone,
Poor people zone,

But it's my home,
All I have known,
Where I got grown,
Streets we would roam

Out of the darkness,
I came the farthest
Among the hardest survival
Learn from these streets,
It can be bleak,
Accept no defeat,
Surrender retreat

So we strugglin'
Fightin' to eat
And we wonderin'
When we'll be free
So we patiently wait
For that fateful day
It's not far away,
But for now we say,

When I get older
I will be stronger
They'll call me 'Freedom'
Just like a wavin' flag

And then it goes back,
And then it goes back
And then it goes back

So many wars,
Settlin' scores,
Bringing us promises,
Leaving us poor,

I heard them say,
Love is the way
Love is the answer,
That's what they say

But look how they treat us,
Make us believers
We fight their battles,
Then they deceive us

Try to control us,
They couldn't hold us
'Cause we just move forward
Like Buffalo soldiers

So we strugglin'
Fightin' to eat
And we wonderin'
When we'll be free
So we patiently wait
For that fateful day
It's not far away,
But for now we say,


When I get older
I will be stronger
They'll call me 'Freedom'
Just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back,
And then it goes back
And then it goes back
And then it goes...

And then it goes...

And everybody will be singing it
And you and I will be singing it
And we all will be singing it


When I get older
I will be stronger
They'll call me 'Freedom'
Just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back,
And then it goes back
And then it goes back
And then it goes 

When I get older
When I get older
I will be stronger
Just like a wavin' flag
Just like a wavin' flag
Just like a wavin' flag, flag, flag
Just like a wavin' flag
