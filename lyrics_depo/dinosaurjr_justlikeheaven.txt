'Show me how you do that trick
The one that makes me scream,' she said
'The one that makes me laugh,' she said
And threw her arms around my head
'Show me how you do it
And I promise you, I promise that
I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you...'

Spinning on that dizzy air
I kissed her face and kissed her hair
And dreamed of all the different ways
I had to make her glow
'Why are you so far away?' she said
'Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you,
That I'm in love with you?'

Soft and only

Lost and lonely

Strange as angels
Sitting in the deepest oceans
Sitting in the water, you're just like a dream

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
I found myself alone
Alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me
