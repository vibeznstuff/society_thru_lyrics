Do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well

Here's the thing
I was minding my own business doin' what I do
I wasn't trying to look for anything
All of a sudden couldn't take my eyes off you
I didn't even know if you could tell
That you had me in a daze sayin' 'What the hell'
Here's my name, number baby just hit my cell
Loving everything you do 'cause you do it well
Don't know what you got me thinkin'


You ain't even trying to play me boy
'Cause you're so good, and you're so fine
Got me sayin' crazy things, listen
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well

Oh, yeah... hey

Let me tell you how it's gonna go
You and me, gonna need a little privacy
I don't wanna do the dance, no do-si-do
I need a one woman man 7 days a week
Quit trying to play it cool boy make your move
I told you how it is, nothin' to lose
You been staring over here all night for free
And I ain't takin' no cash or credit, just a guarantee
There ain't nobody else but me boy



Hey, yeah
OH


Baby not lookin' for false pretenses
I think you just shocked me to my senses
Everything that you do feels right
Do it, do it
Do it, do it all night

I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
'Cause you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well

I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well

I ain't ever met a man like that (No) (Like that)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No) (Like that)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well

I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well
