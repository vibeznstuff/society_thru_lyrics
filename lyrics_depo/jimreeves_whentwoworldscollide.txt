Your world was so different 
From mine don't you see
We just couldn't be close 
Though we tried.

We both reached for heavens 
But ours weren't the same
That's what happens 
When two worlds collide.

Your world was made up 
Of things sweet and good
My world could never 
Fit in, wish it could.

Two hearts lie in shambles 
And oh. how they've cried
That's what happens 
When two worlds collide

Your world was made up 
Of things sweet and good
My world could never 
Fit in, wish it could.

Two hearts lie in shambles 
And oh. how they've cried
That's what happens 
When two worlds collide...
