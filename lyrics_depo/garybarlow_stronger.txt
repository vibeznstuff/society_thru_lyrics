Umm, stronger,
so strong, oh

Stronger ev'ry day, 
stronger ev'ry night,
holdin' out for peace,
now I'm feelin' stronger,

Watchin' as this storm goes by,
I can see a light,
prisoner of my own design,
my hands are firmly tied,
I could just fade away,
live a life unkown,
I could be somewhere else,
but now I'm heading home, oh

Stronger ev'ry day,
stronger ev'ry night,
holdin' out for peace,
now I'm feelin' stronger,

Walkin' from that sheltered world,
with nowhere left to hide,
my naked soul is runnin' free,
my eyes are open wide, (eyes are open)
searchin' for the higher ground,
to make my life complete,
it's only when you climb that mountain,
the world is at your feet, oh

Stronger ev'ry day,
stronger ev'ry night,
holdin' out for peace,
but ready now to fight, oh,
life owes me nothin',
I have tasted ev'rythin',
but I can't wait much longer,
now I'm feelin' stronger,

(stronger each day)
(stronger each night)
(stronger each day)
oh so stronger
babe I'm feelin'

Stronger ev'ry day (stronger ev'ry day)
stronger ev'ry night (ev'ry night)
holdin' out for peace (for peace yeah)
but ready now to fight (oh to fight)
life owes me nothing (nothin')
I have tasted ev'rythin',
but I can't wait much longer,
now I'm feelin' Stronger,

(I'm feelin' stronger,
I'm feelin' stronger)
feel so strong
oh so strong
