I used to live alone
But I found you so certain
I'm yours to take
Now I can't wait
For all the mistakes
We've yet to make

Now shake it up baby
Twist and shout
We're a war torn building
All bombed out
Love not unlike an old drunk
Pissing the night away
Love not unlike

Won't you come over and love me
Won't you come over again
Can you overcome the unnerving
Ossifying body you're in

I used to live alone
Just counting the pretty little flowers on my dress
Now I can't wait to consecrate this wondrous mess
We're a song forgotten till we sing again
Start at the bottom and then we descend

Love not unlike
Little joy ain't around no more
Love not unlike
I am woman hear me roar
Love not unlike
Larry Levan sanctified
Love not unlike

Won't you come over and love me
Won't you come over again
Help me overcome the unnerving
Ossifying body I'm in

I ask all the time
But you never tell me
What have I got to do
To make that man want me

What have I got to do
(Loving you is making it easy)
To make that man want me
(Loving how he's making it all)


What have I got to do
